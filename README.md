# getting and clearing data

This is a repo for the 'Getting and Clearing Data' course at Coursera.
This repo contains:
* [run_analysis.R](https://github.com/demidovakatya/gettingandclearingdata/blob/master/run_analysis.R) – a script that:
  * Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  * Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  * Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  * Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  * From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
* readme.md – the readme file that you are reading now;
* codebook.md – a code book that indicates all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information
