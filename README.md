# Getting and Clearing Data Course Project

This is a repo for the course project to ['Getting and Clearing Data' course](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-033/) at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). The purpose of this project is to demonstrate one's ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

This repo contains:

## run_analysis.R
A script for performing the analysis. 
To get the tidy data file, you need to download and run this script (an Internet connection will be required to download the .zip-file [:package: 50 MB]).

[:ledger: read more about the script →](https://github.com/demidovakatya/gettingandclearingdata/blob/master/CodeBook.md#creating-the-tidy-datafile)

[:page_with_curl: go to run_analysis.R →](https://github.com/demidovakatya/gettingandclearingdata/blob/master/run_analysis.R)

## tidy_data.txt
A text file containing the tidy data set (required to be submitted).

This text file is created by the run_analysis.R script.
[:page_with_curl: look at the text file →](https://github.com/demidovakatya/gettingandclearingdata/blob/master/tidy_data.txt)

## CodeBook.md
A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that are performed to clean up the data. It indicates all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.

## README.md
Explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
