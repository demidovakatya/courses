# Quiz 3: Probability


1\. Your friend told you about someone really smart who made a good deal with the bank regarding his/her mortgage and who knows everything about the financial crisis that started in 2008. Which of the following statements is more likely?

I. Your friend talked about a man.

II. Your friend talked about a man with a job in the banking world.

- **Statement I is more likely.**
- Both statements are equally likely.
- Statement II is more likely


2\. You roll a dice five times. The outcomes are as follows: `6 6 6 6 6`. Then you repeat this and you find: `1 4 3 5 2`.

**The first outcome is equally likely as the second outcome.**


3\. Imagine you're at the beach. You're really thirsty and decide to go to the beach stand to get some coke. When you arrive you see there's a queue consisting of two girls and one boy. Unfortunately the stand has only one coke left. You've learned that three in ten girls drink coke and 60 percent of boys do.

How likely is it for you to get the coke?

```r
0.7 * 0.7 * 0.4
# [1] 0.196
```

- `0.054`
- **`0.196`**
- `0.946`
- `0.804`


4\. You ask a couple of people at the beach how they think about the seagulls. You propose them the statement: Seagulls are annoying. Their responses are as follows:

```
20% strongly agree
13% agree
12% neutral
50% disagree
5% stongly disagree
```

What is the chance of a random person responding with 'agree' given that he/she's not neutral?

```r
0.13 / (1 - 0.12)
# [1] 0.1477273
```

- **`0.15`**
- `0.13`
- `0.25`
- `0.52`


5\. Imagine you ask a couple of students which subject they prefer: statistics or English. There are a lot of people that love statistics (B) and a lot of people that love English (C). However, there are also people that can't make a decision and tell you that they like both the subjects (D). When you look further into the results you realise that all the female students had a positive opinion about statistics (A).

Which of these events (A, B, C, D) are disjoint? 

**Events that do not share any outcomes are called disjoint or mutually exclusive.**

- A and C & B and C
- B and C & C and D
- A and D & B and C
- **A and C & A and D**

6\. You collect four shells from the beach. You know that there are only three types of shells on the beach that occur in equal amounts. How many different events are possible?

```r
3 ^ 4
# [1] 81
```

- 4
- 12
- **81**
- 3


7\. Twenty people take a statistics exam. Jonas got a five out of ten and Emma scored an eight out of ten. Every score (1 till 10) is equally likely. What is the chance of a random person out of the people that took the exam scoring higher than Jonas, but lower than Emma?

```r
# Lower than 8 (Emma's score) and higher than 5 (Jonas): 6 or 7

2 / 10
# [1] 0.2
```

- `0.8`
- `0.22`
- `0.4`
- **`0.2`**


8\. How can we define probability or chance?

- as a probale value that a random variable will take
- as the average or expeted value of a random variable
- as the relative uncertainty about events
- **as a long-run relative frequency**


9\. You estimate the chance of passing a statistics exam given you're a woman. You know that 60 percent of the participants pass the exam, that the probabilities of being man or women are equal, and that the probability of passing the exam and being woman equals `0.34`. What is the chance of passing the statistics exam given that you're a woman?

```r
# A: Passing an exam. P(A) = 0.6.
# B: Being a woman. P(B) = 0.5.
# Probability of A and B: P(AB) = 0.34
# Probability of A given B: P(A|B) - ?

0.34 / 0.5
# [1] 0.68
```

- `0.34`
- `0.31`
- `0.57`
- **`0.68`**


10\. What is the probability of event A given event B?

![](/images/quiz3-a-given-b.png)

```r
# P(B) = 0.16 + 0.22
# P(AB) = 0.16

0.16 / (0.16 + 0.22)
# [1] 0.4210526
```

- `0.16`
- `1.03`
- **`0.42`**
- `0.73`


11\. You have a pot with 100 balls. 20 of them are red, 50 are blue and 30 are green. You decide to draw 5 balls from the pot. What is the probability of drawing five blue balls?

```r
choose(100, 5)
choose(50, 5)
choose(50, 5) / choose(100, 5)
# [1] 0.02814225
```


12\. On a single train journey there is a probability of `0.4` that your ticket will be checked. You make a return-journey, what is the probability that your ticket will be checked only once?

```r
0.4 * 0.6 + 0.6 * 0.4
# [1] 0.48
```


13\. You roll a pair of dice 20 times and record how often you get a total of 5 or 10. What is your best guess for the probability?

```r
7 / 36
# [1] 0.1944444
```

14\. The chance that the front light on your bike will fail is 20%, the chance that your rear light will fail is 10% and the chance that both will fail is 4%. What is the chance that both lights will work? (regardless of the answer you should do something about this situation of course).

```r

```

15\. Which of the following statements is correct?

I. A discrete random variable can take a finite number of distinct values. True

II. Height is an example of a continuous random variable. True

- **Both statements are true.**
- Statement I is true, statement II is false.
