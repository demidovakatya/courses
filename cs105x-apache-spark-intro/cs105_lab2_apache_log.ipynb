It's a very large, common data source and contains a rich set of information.  Spark allows you to store your logs in files on disk cheaply, while still providing a quick and simple way to perform data analysis on them.  This homework will show you how to use Apache Spark on real-world text-based production logs and fully harness the power of that data.  Log data comes from many sources, such as web, file, and compute servers, application logs, user-generated content,  and can be used for monitoring servers, improving business and customer intelligence, building recommendation systems, fraud detection, and much more."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["labVersion = 'cs105x-lab2-1.1.0'"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## How to complete this lab\n\nThis lab is broken up into sections with bite-sized examples for demonstrating Spark functionality for log processing.\n\nIt consists of 5 parts:\n* *Part 1:* Introduction and Imports\n* *Part 2:* Exploratory Data Analysis\n* *Part 3*: Analysis Walk-Through on the Web Server Log File\n* *Part 4*: Analyzing Web Server Log File\n* *Part 5*: Exploring 404 Response Codes\n\nAlso, at the very bottom:\n\n* *Appendix A*: Submitting Your Exercises to the Autograder"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Part 1: Introduction and Imports\n\n### A note about DataFrame column references\n\nIn Python, it's possible to access a DataFrame's columns either by attribute (`df.age`) or by indexing (`df['age']`). Referring to a column by attribute (`df.age`) is very Pandas-like, and it's highly convenient, especially when you're doing interactive data exploration. But it can fail, for reasons that aren't obvious. For example:"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["throwaway_df = sqlContext.createDataFrame([('Anthony', 10), ('Julia', 20), ('Fred', 5)], ('name', 'count'))\n# throwaway_df.select(throwaway_df.count).show() # This line does not work.

If it finds one, it uses it. Otherwise, it calls a special Python function (`__getattr__`), which defaults to throwing an exception. Spark has overridden `__getattr__` to look for a column on the DataFrame.\n\n**This means you can only use the attribute (dot) syntax to refer to a column if the DataFrame does not _already_ have an attribute with the column's name.**\n\nIn the above example, there's already a `count()` method on the `DataFrame` class, so `throwaway_df.count` does not refer to our \"count\" column; instead, it refers to the `count()` _method_.\n\nTo avoid this problem, you can refer to the column using subscript notation: `throwaway_df['count']`.
