Many traditional frameworks were designed to be run on a single computer.  However, many datasets today are too large to be stored on a single computer, and even when a dataset can be stored on one computer (such as the datasets in this tutorial), the dataset can often be processed much more quickly using multiple computers.\n\nSpark has efficient implementations of a number of transformations and actions that can be composed together to perform data processing and analysis.  Spark excels at distributing these operations across a cluster while abstracting away many of the underlying implementation details.  Spark has been designed with a focus on scalability and efficiency.  With Spark you can begin developing your solution on your laptop, using a small dataset, and then use that same code to process terabytes or even petabytes across a distributed cluster.\n\n**During this tutorial we will cover:**\n\n* *Part 1:* Basic notebook usage and [Python](https://docs.python.org/2/) integration\n* *Part 2:* An introduction to using [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) with the [PySpark SQL API](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.sql.html#pyspark-sql-module) running in a notebook\n* *Part 3:* Using DataFrames and chaining together transformations and actions\n* *Part 4*: Python Lambda functions and User Defined Functions\n* *Part 5:* Additional DataFrame actions\n* *Part 6:* Additional DataFrame transformations\n* *Part 7:* Caching DataFrames and storage options\n* *Part 8:* Debugging Spark applications and lazy evaluation\n\nThe following transformations will be covered:\n* `select()`, `filter()`, `distinct()`, `dropDuplicates()`, `orderBy()`, `groupBy()`\n\nThe following actions will be covered:\n* `first()`, `take()`, `count()`, `collect()`, `show()`\n\nAlso covered:\n* `cache()`, `unpersist()`\n\nNote that, for reference, you can look up the details of these methods in the [Spark's PySpark SQL API](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.sql.html#pyspark-sql-module)"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **Part 1: Basic notebook usage and [Python](https://docs.python.org/2/) integration **"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### (1a) Notebook usage\n\nA notebook is comprised of a linear sequence of cells.

The driver has Spark jobs that it needs to run and these jobs are split into tasks that are submitted to the executors for completion.  The results from these tasks are delivered back to the driver.\n\nIn part 1, we saw that normal Python code can be executed via cells. When using Databricks this code gets executed in the Spark driver's Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and not in an executor's JVM, and when using an Jupyter notebook it is executed within the kernel associated with the notebook. Since no Spark functionality is actually being used, no tasks are launched on the executors.\n\nIn order to use Spark and its DataFrame API we will need to use a `SQLContext`.  When running Spark, you start a new Spark application by creating a [SparkContext](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.SparkContext). You can then create a [SQLContext](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.sql.html#pyspark.sql.SQLContext) from the `SparkContext`. When the `SparkContext` is created, it asks the master for some cores to use to do work.  The master sets these cores aside just for you; they won't be used for other applications. When using Databricks, both a `SparkContext` and a `SQLContext` are created for you automatically. `sc` is your `SparkContext`, and `sqlContext` is your `SQLContext`."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### (2a) Example Cluster\nThe diagram shows an example cluster, where the slots allocated for an application are outlined in purple.

The web UI is accessible in Databricks by going to \"Clusters\" and then clicking on the \"Spark UI\" link for your cluster.  In the web UI, under the \"Jobs\" tab, you can see a list of jobs that have been scheduled or run.  It's likely there isn't any thing interesting here yet because we haven't run any jobs, but we'll return to this page later.\n\nAt a high level, every Spark application consists of a driver program that launches various parallel operations on executor Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) running either in a cluster or locally on the same machine. In Databricks, \"Databricks Shell\" is the driver program.  When running locally, `pyspark` is the driver program. In all cases, this driver program contains the main loop for the program and creates distributed datasets on the cluster, then applies operations (transformations & actions) to those datasets.\nDriver programs access Spark through a SparkContext object, which represents a connection to a computing cluster. A Spark SQL context object (`sqlContext`) is the main entry point for Spark DataFrame and SQL functionality. A `SQLContext` can be used to create DataFrames, which allows you to direct the operations on your data.\n\nTry printing out `sqlContext` to see its type."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Display the type of the Spark sqlContext\ntype(sqlContext)"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":15},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Note that the type is `HiveContext`.

Each transformation you apply to a DataFrame adds some information to the query plan. When you finally call an action, which triggers execution of your Spark job, several things happen:\n\n1. Spark's Catalyst optimizer analyzes the query plan (called an _unoptimized logical query plan_) and attempts to optimize it. Optimizations include (but aren't limited to) rearranging and combining `filter()` operations for efficiency, converting `Decimal` operations to more efficient long integer operations, and pushing some operations down into the data source (e.g., a `filter()` operation might be translated to a SQL `WHERE` clause, if the data source is a traditional SQL RDBMS). The result of this optimization phase is an _optimized logical plan_.\n2. Once Catalyst has an optimized logical plan, it then constructs multiple _physical_ plans from it. Specifically, it implements the query in terms of lower level Spark RDD operations.\n3. Catalyst chooses which physical plan to use via _cost optimization_. That is, it determines which physical plan is the most efficient (or least expensive), and uses that one.\n4. Finally, once the physical RDD execution plan is established, Spark actually executes the job.\n\nYou can examine the query plan using the `explain()` function on a DataFrame. By default, `explain()` only shows you the final physical plan; however, if you pass it an argument of `True`, it will show you all phases.\n\n(If you want to take a deeper dive into how Catalyst optimizes DataFrame queries, this blog post, while a little old, is an excellent overview: [Deep Dive into Spark SQL's Catalyst Optimizer](https://databricks.com/blog/2015/04/13/deep-dive-into-spark-sqls-catalyst-optimizer.html).)\n\nLet's add a couple transformations to our DataFrame and look at the query plan on the resulting transformed DataFrame. Don't be too concerned if it looks like gibberish. As you gain more experience with Apache Spark, you'll begin to be able to use `explain()` to help you understand more about your DataFrame operations."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["newDF = dataDF.distinct().select('*')\nnewDF.explain(True)"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":51},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### (3c): Subtract one from each value using _select_\n\nSo far, we've created a distributed DataFrame that is split into many partitions, where each partition is stored on a single machine in our cluster.  Let's look at what happens when we do a basic operation on the dataset.  Many useful data analysis operations can be specified as \"do something to each item in the dataset\".  These data-parallel operations are convenient because each item in the dataset can be processed individually: the operation on one entry doesn't effect the operations on any of the other entries.  Therefore, Spark can parallelize the operation.\n\nOne of the most common DataFrame operations is `select()`, and it works more or less like a SQL `SELECT` statement: You can select specific columns from the DataFrame, and you can even use `select()` to create _new_ columns with values that are derived from existing column values. We can use `select()` to create a new column that decrements the value of the existing `age` column.\n\n`select()` is a _transformation_. It returns a new DataFrame that captures both the previous DataFrame and the operation to add to the query (`select`, in this case). But it does *not* actually execute anything on the cluster. When transforming DataFrames, we are building up a _query plan_.

To do this we can call the `collect()` method on our DataFrame.  `collect()` is often used after transformations to ensure that we are only returning a *small* amount of data to the driver.  This is done because the data returned to the driver must fit into the driver's available memory.  If not, the driver will crash.\n\nThe `collect()` method is the first action operation that we have encountered.  Action operations cause Spark to perform the (lazy) transformation operations that are required to compute the values returned by the action.  In our example, this means that tasks will now be launched to perform the `createDataFrame`, `select`, and `collect` operations.\n\nIn the diagram, the dataset is broken into four partitions, so four `collect()` tasks are launched.

Remember that `lambda` functions are a matter of style and using them is never required - semantically, they are just syntactic sugar for a normal function definition. You can always define a separate normal function instead, but using a `lambda` function is an equivalent and more compact form of coding. Ideally you should consider using `lambda` functions where you want to encapsulate non-reusable code without littering your code with one-line functions.\n\nHere, instead of defining a separate function for the `filter()` transformation, we will use an inline `lambda()` function and we will register that lambda as a Spark _User Defined Function_ (UDF).

(More formally, it keeps the _RDDs_ that implement your DataFrames in memory.) By keeping the contents in memory, Spark can quickly access the data. However, memory is limited, so if you try to keep too many partitions in memory, Spark will automatically delete partitions from memory to make space for new ones. If you later refer to one of the deleted partitions, Spark will automatically recreate it for you, but that takes time.\n\nSo, if you plan to use a DataFrame more than once, then you should tell Spark to cache it. You can use the `cache()` operation to keep the DataFrame in memory. However, you must still trigger an action on the DataFrame, such as `collect()` or `count()` before the caching will occur. In other words, `cache()` is lazy: It merely tells Spark that the DataFrame should be cached _when the data is materialized_. You have to run an action to materialize the data; the DataFrame will be cached as a side effect. The next time you use the DataFrame, Spark will use the cached data, rather than recomputing the DataFrame from the original data.\n\nYou can see your cached DataFrame in the \"Storage\" section of the Spark web UI.

Methods are called as if the Java objects resided in the Python interpreter and Java collections can be accessed through standard Python collection methods.
