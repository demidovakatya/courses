Cell mediated immune status in malignancy--pretherapy and post-therapy assessment.,"Twenty-eight cases of malignancies of different kinds were studied to assess T-cell activity and population before and after institution of therapy. Fifteen cases were diagnosed as non-metastasising squamous cell carcinoma of larynx, pharynx, laryngopharynx, hypopharynx and tonsils. Seven cases were non-metastasising infiltrating duct carcinoma of breast and 6 cases were non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). It was observed that 3 out of 15 cases (20%) of squamous cell carcinoma cases were Mantoux test (MT) negative with a T-cell population of less than 40%, 2 out of 7 cases (28.6%) of infiltrating duct carcinoma of breast were MT negative with a T-cell population of less than 40% and 3 out of 6 cases (50%) of NHL were MT negative with a T-cell population of less than 40%. The normal controls, consisting of apparently normal healthy adults, had a T-cell population of more than 40% and were all MT positive. The patients who showed a negative skin test and a T-cell population less than 40% were further subjected to assessment of T-cell population and activity after appropriate therapy, and clinical cure of the disease. It was observed that 2 out of 3 cases (66.66%) of squamous cell carcinomas, 2 out of 2 cases (100%) of adenocarcinomas and one out of 3 cases (33.33%) of NHL showed positive conversion with a T-cell population of more than 40%.",0
Neoadjuvant vinorelbine-capecitabine versus docetaxel-doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide in early nonresponsive breast cancer: phase III randomized GeparTrio trial.,"BACKGROUND: Among breast cancer patients, nonresponse to initial neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with unfavorable outcome. We compared the response of nonresponding patients who continued the same treatment with that of patients who switched to a well-tolerated non-cross-resistant regimen. METHODS: Previously untreated breast cancer patients received two 3-week cycles of docetaxel at 75 mg/m(2), doxorubicin at 50 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide at 500 mg/m(2) per day (TAC). Patients whose tumors did not decrease in size by at least 50% were randomly assigned to four additional cycles of TAC or to four cycles of vinorelbine at 25 mg/m(2) and capecitabine at 2000 mg/m(2) (NX). The outcome was sonographic response, defined as a reduction in the product of the two largest perpendicular diameters by at least 50%. A difference of 10% or less in the sonographic response qualified as noninferiority of the NX treatment. Pathological complete response was defined as no invasive or in situ residual tumor masses in the breast and lymph nodes. Toxic effects were assessed. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Of 2090 patients enrolled in the GeparTrio study, 622 (29.8%) who did not respond to two initial cycles of TAC were randomly assigned to an additional four cycles of TAC (n = 321) or to four cycles of NX (n = 301). Sonographic response rate was 50.5% for the TAC arm and 51.2% for the NX arm. The difference of 0.7% (95% confidence interval = -7.1% to 8.5%) demonstrated noninferiority of NX (P = .008). Similar numbers of patients in both arms received breast-conserving surgery (184 [57.3%] in the TAC arm vs 180 [59.8%] in the NX arm) and had a pathological complete response (5.3% vs 6.0%). Fewer patients in the NX arm than in the TAC arm had hematologic toxic effects, mucositis, infections, and nail changes, but more had hand-foot syndrome and sensory neuropathy. CONCLUSION: Pathological complete responses to both regimens were marginal. Among patients who did not respond to the initial neoadjuvant TAC treatment, similar efficacy but better tolerability was observed by switching to NX than continuing with TAC.",1
"Randomized phase 3 trial of fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide alone or followed by Paclitaxel for early breast cancer.","BACKGROUND: Taxanes are among the most active drugs for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, and, as a consequence, they have also been studied in the adjuvant setting.METHODS: After breast cancer surgery, women with lymph node-positive disease were randomly assigned to treatment with fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC) or with FEC followed by weekly paclitaxel (FEC-P). The primary endpoint of study-5-year disease-free survival (DFS)-was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Secondary endpoints included overall survival and analysis of the prognostic and predictive value of clinical and molecular (hormone receptors by immunohistochemistry and HER2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization) markers. Associations and interactions were assessed with a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model for DFS for the following covariates: age, menopausal status, tumor size, lymph node status, type of chemotherapy, tumor size, positive lymph nodes, HER2 status, and hormone receptor status. All statistical tests were two-sided.RESULTS: Among the 1246 eligible patients, estimated rates of DFS at 5 years were 78.5% in the FEC-P arm and 72.1% in the FEC arm (difference = 6.4%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.6% to 11.2%; P = .006). FEC-P treatment was associated with a 23% reduction in the risk of relapse compared with FEC treatment (146 relapses in the 614 patients in the FEC-P arm vs 193 relapses in the 632 patients in the FEC arm, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.62 to 0.95; P = .022) and a 22% reduction in the risk of death (73 and 95 deaths, respectively, HR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.57 to 1.06; P = .110). Among the 928 patients for whom tumor samples were centrally analyzed, type of chemotherapy (FEC vs FEC-P) (P = .017), number of involved axillary lymph nodes (P < .001), tumor size (P = .020), hormone receptor status (P = .004), and HER2 status (P = .006) were all associated with DFS. We found no statistically significant interaction between HER2 status and paclitaxel treatment or between hormone receptor status and paclitaxel treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with operable breast cancer, FEC-P treatment statistically significantly reduced the risk of relapse compared with FEC as adjuvant therapy.",1
Is first-line single-agent mitoxantrone in the treatment of high-risk metastatic breast cancer patients as effective as combination chemotherapy? No difference in survival but higher quality of life were found in a multicenter randomized trial.,"BACKGROUND: To determine whether patients with high-risk metastatic breast cancer draw benefit from combination chemotherapy as first-line treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 260 women with measurable metastatic breast cancer fulfilling high-risk criteria, previously untreated with chemotherapy for their metastatic disease, were randomized to receive either mitoxantrone 12 mg/m(2) or the combination of fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 50 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2) (FEC) every 3 weeks. Treatment was continued until complete remission plus two cycles, or until disease progression. In the case of partial remission or stable disease, treatment was stopped after 12 cycles. Second-line treatment was vindesine, mitomycin and prednisolone. Gain from treatment was estimated using a modified Brunner's score composed of time to progression, patients' rating of the treatment benefit, alopecia, vomiting and performance status. RESULTS: After recruitment from 1992 to 1997 and observation from 1997 to 1999, the final evaluation showed that single-agent treatment with mitoxantrone does not differ significantly from combination treatment with FEC in terms of response, objective remission rate, remission duration, time to response, time to best response, time to progression or overall survival. There was, however, a significant difference in gain from treatment using a modified Brunner's score favoring the single-agent treatment arm. There was no evidence that any subgroup would fare better with combination treatment. CONCLUSIONS: No significant difference was detected between the treatment with mitoxantrone as a single agent and the combination of low-dose FEC in terms of response or survival; therefore, the imperative of the necessity of first-line combination chemotherapy for patients with high-risk metastatic breast cancer may be questioned. Since toxicity and quality of life score favored the single-agent mitoxantrone treatment arm, this treatment may be offered to patients preferring quality of life to a potential small prolongation of survival.",1
"Expression of Bcl-2 in node-negative breast cancer is associated with various prognostic factors, but does not predict response to one course of perioperative chemotherapy.","The aim of this study was to assess relationships between Bcl-2 expression, response to chemotherapy and a number of pathological and biological tumour parameters in premenopausal, lymph node-negative breast cancer patients. Expression of Bcl-2 was determined using immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded sections in a series of 441 premenopausal, lymph node-negative breast cancers of patients randomised to receive perioperative chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide) or no perioperative chemotherapy. Immunohistochemistry of Bcl-2 was evaluated by scoring both staining intensity (0-3) and number of positive cells (0-2). Using these scores tumours were grouped into categories 0-6. It was found that 9.2% of the tumours were completely negative (0), 17.2% weakly (1 + 2), 41.6% moderately (3 + 4) and 31.9% strongly positive (5 + 6) for Bcl-2. A positive correlation was found between high Bcl-2 expression and oestrogen (P < 0.001) and progesterone receptor positivity (P < 0.001) and low tumour grade (P < 0.001), whereas high Bcl-2 expression was negatively correlated with p53 (P < 0.001) and c-erb-B-2 positively (P < 0.001), high Ki-67 index (P < 0.001), mitotic index (P < 0.001) and large tumour size (P = 0.006). Patients with tumours expressing high levels of Bcl-2 (overall score 3-6) had a significantly better disease-free (P = 0.004) and overall (P = 0.009) survival. However, in a multivariate model this association no longer remained significant. There was a trend for an effect of adjuvant chemotherapy on disease-free survival both for patients with Bcl-2-positive (HR-0.61, 95% CI 0.35-1.06, P = 0.07) and negative (HR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.27-1.12, P = 0.09) breast tumours at a median follow-up of 49 months. The level of Bcl-2 expression does not seem to predict response to perioperative chemotherapy in premenopausal, lymph node-negative breast cancer patients. High levels of Bcl-2 are preferentially expressed in well-differentiated tumours and are associated with favourable prognosis. However, Bcl-2 expression is not an independent prognostic factor in this patient series.",0
Combination docetaxel/cyclophosphamide in patients with advanced solid tumors.,"Preclinical studies show that docetaxel (Taxotere) and cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan, Neosar) are synergistic against MA 13/C mammary adenocarcinoma. Both agents are highly active as monotherapy in a number of tumors, including metastatic breast cancer. Therefore, we performed a phase I dose-finding study to determine the maximum tolerated dose of this combination regimen in patients with advanced solid tumors. A total of 45 patients were enrolled and received cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel, both administered as 1-hour intravenous infusions once every 3 weeks. The dose levels of cyclophosphamide/docetaxel were 600/60 mg/m2 (group 0), 600/75 mg/m2 (group I), 700/75 mg/m2 (group 2), 800/75 mg/m2 (group 3), 800/85 mg/m2 (group 4), 800/75 mg/m2 (group 5), and 800/85 mg/m2 (group 6). Patients with dose-limiting neutropenia in groups 5 and 6 received 300 micrograms of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (filgrastim [Neupogen]) support on days 2 through 9 during subsequent cycles of chemotherapy. All patients received premedication with 8 mg of dexamethasone twice daily for 5 days, beginning 1 day prior to chemotherapy. The dose-limiting toxicity was neutropenia fever. The recommended dose for phase II studies of cyclophosphamide/docetaxel is 700/75 mg/m2 in previously treated patients and 800/75 mg/m2 in previously untreated patients. G-CSF support did not allow for further dose escalation. Preliminary results from this phase I trial indicate that the combination of docetaxel and cyclophosphamide produced an objective response rate of 69% in 32 patients with metastatic breast cancer (including 3 patients who achieved complete responses).",1
Long-term endometrial effects in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer participating in the Intergroup Exemestane Study (IES)--a randomised controlled trial of exemestane versus continued tamoxifen after 2-3 years tamoxifen.,"BACKGROUND: The antiestrogen tamoxifen may have partial estrogen-like effects on the postmenopausal uterus. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are increasingly used after initial tamoxifen in the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal early breast cancer due to their mechanism of action: a potential benefit being a reduction of uterine abnormalities caused by tamoxifen.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sonographic uterine effects of the steroidal AI exemestane were studied in 219 women participating in the Intergroup Exemestane Study: a large trial in postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive (or unknown) early breast cancer, disease free after 2-3 years of tamoxifen, randomly assigned to continue tamoxifen or switch to exemestane to complete 5 years adjuvant treatment. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with abnormal (> or =5 mm) endometrial thickness (ET) on transvaginal ultrasound 24 months after randomisation.RESULTS: The analysis included 183 patients. Two years after randomisation, the proportion of patients with abnormal ET was significantly lower in the exemestane compared with tamoxifen arm (36% versus 62%, respectively; P = 0.004). This difference emerged within 6 months of switching treatment (43.5% versus 65.2%, respectively; P = 0.01) and disappeared within 12 months of treatment completion (30.8% versus 34.7%, respectively; P = 0.67).CONCLUSION: Switching from tamoxifen to exemestane significantly reverses endometrial thickening associated with continued tamoxifen.",0
Postoperative radiotherapy in high-risk postmenopausal breast-cancer patients given adjuvant tamoxifen: Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group DBCG 82c randomised trial.,"BACKGROUND: Postmastectomy radiotherapy is associated with a lower locoregional recurrence rate and improved disease-free and overall survival when combined with chemotherapy in premenopausal high-risk breast-cancer patients. However, whether the same benefits apply also in postmenopausal women treated with adjuvant tamoxifen for similar high-risk cancer is unclear. In a randomised trial among postmenopausal women who had undergone mastectomy, we compared adjuvant tamoxifen alone with tamoxifen plus postoperative radiotherapy. METHODS: Between 1982 and 1990, postmenopausal women with high-risk breast cancer (stage II or III) were randomly assigned adjuvant tamoxifen (30 mg daily for 1 year) alone (689) or with postoperative radiotherapy to the chest wall and regional lymph nodes (686). Median follow-up was 123 months. The endpoints were first site of recurrence (locoregional recurrence, distant metastases, or both), and disease-free and overall survival. FINDINGS: Locoregional recurrence occurred in 52 (8%) of the radiotherapy plus tamoxifen group and 242 (35%) of the tamoxifen only group (p<0.001). In total there were 321 (47%) and 411 (60%) recurrences, respectively. Disease-free survival was 36% in the radiotherapy plus tamoxifen group and 24% in the tamoxifen alone group (p<0.001). Overall survival was also higher in the radiotherapy group (385 vs 434 deaths; survival 45 vs 36% at 10 years, p=0.03). INTERPRETATION: Postoperative radiotherapy decreased the risk of locoregional recurrence and was associated with improved survival in high-risk postmenopausal breast-cancer patients after mastectomy and limited axillary dissection, with 1 year of adjuvant tamoxifen treatment. Improved survival in high-risk breast cancer can best be achieved by a strategy of both locoregional and systemic tumour control.",0
"Mometasone furoate effect on acute skin toxicity in breast cancer patients receiving radiotherapy: a phase III double-blind, randomized trial from the North Central Cancer Treatment Group N06C4.","PURPOSE: A two-arm, double-blind, randomized trial was performed to evaluate the effect of 0.1% mometasone furoate (MMF) on acute skin-related toxicity in patients undergoing breast or chest wall radiotherapy.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive breast carcinoma who were undergoing external beam radiotherapy to the breast or chest wall were randomly assigned to apply 0.1% MMF or placebo cream daily. The primary study endpoint was the provider-assessed maximal grade of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0, radiation dermatitis. The secondary endpoints included provider-assessed Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Grade 3 or greater radiation dermatitis and adverse event monitoring. The patient-reported outcome measures included the Skindex-16, the Skin Toxicity Assessment Tool, a Symptom Experience Diary, and a quality-of-life self-assessment. An assessment was performed at baseline, weekly during radiotherapy, and for 2 weeks after radiotherapy.RESULTS: A total of 176 patients were enrolled between September 21, 2007, and December 7, 2007. The provider-assessed primary endpoint showed no difference in the mean maximum grade of radiation dermatitis by treatment arm (1.2 for MMF vs. 1.3 for placebo; p = .18). Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events toxicity was greater in the placebo group (p = .04), primarily from pruritus. For the patient-reported outcome measures, the maximum Skindex-16 score for the MMF group showed less itching (p = .008), less irritation (p = .01), less symptom persistence or recurrence (p = .02), and less annoyance with skin problems (p = .04). The group's maximal Skin Toxicity Assessment Tool score showed less burning sensation (p = .02) and less itching (p = .002).CONCLUSION: Patients receiving daily MMF during radiotherapy might experience reduced acute skin toxicity compared with patients receiving placebo.",0
Adjuvant therapy of cancer via the cellular immune mechanism or fibrin by induced fibrinolysis and oral anticoagulants.,"The value of the oral anticoagulant warfarin sodium and fibrinolytic agents is discussed in relation to cancer surgery. A controlled trial of 128 patients showed that in a variety of recurrent cases the addition of warfarin to chemotherapy doubled the 2-year survival rate. The best results were obtained in postmenopausal patients with breast cancer. Warfarin depresses cellular immune responses which might militate against its use for cases undergoing ""curative"" surgery. Instead, induction of fibrinolysis by streptokinase or Brinase is suggested, because it increases the activity of the cellular immune mechanism. The results to date of an ongoing controlled randomized trial of streptokinase with surgery of tumors of the large bowel are presented, showing that the trends are in favor of streptokinase therapy; however, insufficient time has elapsed to make it, as yet, statistically significant. The action of streptokinase-induced plasmin and Brinase on lymphocytes is described.",0
High-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue for metastatic breast cancer: superior survival for tandem compared with single transplants.,"During 1990-1999, we treated 60 patients with breast cancer who had distant metastases with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue (HDC) after they had responded to induction chemotherapy. HDC regimens were MiTepa (60 mg/m2 mitoxantrone by continuous intravenous infusion over 3 days plus 300 mg/m2 thiotepa intravenously over 2 hours daily x 3 days) and ICE (12 g/m2 ifosfamide, 1800 mg/m2 carboplatin, 2 g/m2 etoposide; all 3 by continuous intravenous over 4 days). At a median follow up >8 years, the median failure-free survival (FFS) was 13.9 months, median overall survival (OS) 29.1 months, 5-year FFS 12%s and 5-year OS 25%. Thirty-three patients underwent tandem (T) transplants; 27 underwent a single (S) HDC. Median ages for these 2 groups were 45 and 48 years; bone and liver metastases were more prevalent in the T cohort, whereas lung metastases were more prevalent in the S cohort. At a median follow up of 6.5 years for the S group and >9 years for the T group, there were 52 deaths. FFS was better for T: median 15.7 versus 7.7 months (p2 = 0.010) as was OS: median 32.7 versus 17.7 months, 2-year survival 68% versus 41%, and 5-year survival 32% versus 15% (p2 = 0.010). As a group, patients with distant metastatic breast cancer who underwent tandem transplants had a better posttransplant survival than patients who underwent a single HDC.",0
A randomised pilot Phase II study of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) or epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (EC) given 2 weekly with pegfilgrastim (accelerated) vs 3 weekly (standard) for women with early breast cancer.,"Accelerated (dose-dense) chemotherapy, in which the frequency of administration is increased without changing total dose or duration, may increase the efficacy of cancer chemotherapy. We performed a randomised Phase II study to assess the safety and relative toxicity of AC (doxorubicin; cyclophosphamide) vs E(epirubicin)C given by conventional or accelerated schedules as neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy for early breast cancer. Furthermore, the relative toxicity of doxorubicin and epirubicin remains uncertain. Patients were randomised to one of four arms; four courses of standard 3 weekly cyclophosphamide 600 mg m(-2) in combination with doxorubicin 60 mg m(-2) (AC) vs epirubicin 90 mg m(-2) (EC) 3 weekly vs the same regimens administered every 2 weeks with pegfilgrastim (G-CSF). A total of 126 patients were treated, 42 with standard AC, 42 with accelerated AC, 19 with standard EC and 23 with accelerated EC. Significantly more grade 3/4 day one neutropenia was seen with standard (6/61, 10%) compared to accelerated (0/65,) regimens (P=0.01). A trend towards more neutropenic sepsis was seen in the combined standard and accelerated AC arms (12/84, 14%) compared to the combined EC arms (1/42, 2%), P=0.06. Falls in left ventricular ejection fraction were not increased with accelerated treatment. Accelerated AC and EC with pegfilgrastim are safe and feasible regimens in the treatment of early breast cancer with less neutropenia than conventional 3 weekly schedules.",1
New pharmacological developments in the treatment of hepatocellular cancer.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver neoplasm and fourth leading cause of cancer death worldwide. The survival for patients with advanced HCC is extremely poor. This is largely attributed to the lack of effective screening methods, advanced stage at presentation, limited utility of surgical intervention and ineffective medical therapy. Over the past 30 years, many conventional cytotoxic agents have been tested and have failed to confer a survival benefit. Recently, sorafenib, a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was approved by the US FDA as first-line therapy in HCC as the first agent demonstrating survival benefit in this disease. Although the survival benefit demonstrated by sorafenib is moderate, molecular targeted therapy has brought new hope in the management of HCC.",0
The role of chemotherapeutic drugs in the evaluation of breast tumour response to chemotherapy using serial FDG-PET.,"INTRODUCTION: The aims of this study were to investigate whether drug sequence (docetaxel followed by anthracyclines or the drugs in reverse order) affects changes in the maximal standard uptake volume (SUVmax) on [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) during neoadjuvant chemotherapy in women with locally advanced breast cancer.METHODS: Women were randomly assigned to receive either drug sequence, and FDG-PET scans were taken at baseline, after four cycles and after eight cycles of chemotherapy. Tumour response to chemotherapy was evaluated based on histology from a surgical specimen collected upon completion of chemotherapy.RESULTS: Sixty women were enrolled into the study. Thirty-one received docetaxel followed by anthracyclines (Arm A) and 29 received drugs in the reverse order (Arm B). Most women (83%) had ductal carcinoma and 10 women (17%) had lobular or lobular/ductal carcinoma. All but one tumour were downstaged during therapy. Overall, there was no significant difference in response between the two drug regimens. However, women in Arm B who achieved complete pathological response had mean FDG-PET SUVmax reduction of 87.7% after four cycles, in contrast to those who had no or minor pathological response. These women recorded mean SUVmax reductions of only 27% (P < 0.01). Women in Arm A showed no significant difference in SUVmax response according to pathological response. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and positive and negative predictive values were highest in women in Arm B.CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that SUVmax uptake by breast tumours during chemotherapy can be dependent on the drugs used. Care must be taken when interpreting FDG-PET in settings where patients receive varied drug protocols.",0
"Adjuvant capecitabine, docetaxel, cyclophosphamide, and epirubicin for early breast cancer: final analysis of the randomized FinXX trial.","PURPOSE: Capecitabine is an active agent in the treatment of breast cancer. It is not known whether integration of capecitabine into an adjuvant regimen that contains a taxane, an anthracycline, and cyclophosphamide improves outcome in early breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women with axillary node-positive or high-risk node-negative breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive either three cycles of docetaxel and capecitabine (TX) followed by three cycles of cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and capecitabine (CEX; n = 753) or three cycles of docetaxel (T) followed by three cycles of cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and fluorouracil (CEF; n = 747). The primary end point was recurrence-free survival (RFS). RESULTS: During a median follow-up time of 59 months, 214 RFS events occurred (local or distant recurrences or deaths; TX/CEX, n = 96; T/CEF, n = 118). RFS was not significantly different between the groups (hazard ratio [HR], 0.79; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.04; P = .087; 5-year RFS, 86.6% for TX/CEX v 84.1% for T/CEF). Fifty-six patients assigned to TX/CEX died during the follow-up compared with 75 of patients assigned to T/CEF (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.04; P = .080). In exploratory analyses, TX/CEX improved breast cancer-specific survival (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.95; P = .027) and RFS in women with triple-negative disease and in women who had more than three metastatic axillary lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis. We detected little severe late toxicity. CONCLUSION: Integration of capecitabine into a regimen that contains docetaxel, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide did not improve RFS significantly compared with a similar regimen without capecitabine.",1

Potentiation of the response to chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer by dietary supplementation with L-arginine: results of a randomised controlled trial.,"Patients with large primary breast cancers are being treated with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Studies in animals have shown that responses to chemotherapy can be increased by dietary manipulation of tumour cell metabolism. Also dietary supplementation with the amino acid L-arginine, resulted in an increase in tumour metabolic activity expression of the nuclear activation antigen, Ki67, in patients with breast cancer. Therefore, we have carried out a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial to determine if L-arginine supplementation is beneficial in patients with breast cancer, undergoing neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. 96 patients were randomised to receive L-arginine (30 g/day) for three days (n = 48) or placebo (n = 48) prior to undergoing chemotherapy (doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone), 6 pulses at 21-day intervals. Clinical and pathological responses were assessed in both groups of patients following completion of chemotherapy. The clinical response rate was 77% (23% complete and 54% partial responses) in the L-arginine treated group, compared with 71% (15% complete and 56% partial) in the placebo group of patients (p = ns). However, in patients with tumours less than 6 cm in initial diameter, there was a significant increase in the better histopathological responses in the L-arginine group, when compared with the placebo group of patients (88% vs 52%, p = 0.04). This may have important implications for clinical practice.",0
Results of two randomized trials evaluating adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy in 1146 patients with early breast cancer.,"Two randomized trials evaluated the effect of 6 courses of anthracycline-based chemotherapy in early breast cancer. A total of 1146 patients were included: 311 high-risk node-negative premenopausal patients and 835 high-risk node-negative or node-positive postmenopausal patients. Patients were randomized after surgery to receive either no chemotherapy (control group) or 6 courses of anthracycline-based chemotherapy (CT group). Postmenopausal patients received adjuvant tamoxifen for at least two years. Radiotherapy was delivered after completion of chemotherapy in the CT group. The 10-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 60% in the control group and 65% in the CT group (log-rank test, p = 0.01). The 10-year distant metastasis rates were 28% and 23% (p = 0.02), and the 10-year local recurrence rates were 12% and 10%, respectively (p = 0.24). Chemotherapy was significantly less effective in post-menopausal patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors. Adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy yielded a significant benefit for DFS by lowering the risk of distant metastases. After up to 10 years of follow-up, deferring radiotherapy after chemotherapy did not compromise local control.",1
"Bazedoxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator: effects on the endometrium, ovaries, and breast from a randomized controlled trial in osteoporotic postmenopausal women.","OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the endometrial, ovarian, and breast safety of bazedoxifene used as a treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis. METHODS: Healthy women (aged 55-85 y) with osteoporosis were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial. Participants were randomized to treatment with bazedoxifene 20 or 40 mg, raloxifene 60 mg, or placebo daily for 3 years. Endometrial and ovarian safety was assessed by periodic transvaginal ultrasonography and endometrial biopsy through 24 months. Gynecologic and breast-related adverse events were recorded throughout the study. RESULTS: Among 753 participants with available transvaginal ultrasonography data, there were no significant between-group differences in overall endometrial thickness or in the percentage of participants with endometrial thickness greater than 5 mm at 12 or 24 months. Changes in the mean endometrial thickness (+/-SE) from baseline were -0.07 +/- 0.11 mm (bazedoxifene 20 mg), 0.10 +/- 0.11 mm (bazedoxifene 40 mg), 0.16 +/- 0.12 mm (raloxifene 60 mg), and -0.08 +/- 0.11 mm (placebo) at 24 months. There was one report of endometrial hyperplasia in each group, and there were zero, two, two, and three reports of endometrial carcinoma with bazedoxifene 20 and 40 mg, raloxifene 60 mg, and placebo, respectively. There were no clinically important changes from baseline in the number or size of ovarian cysts among groups. There was a significantly lower incidence of fibrocystic breast disease (P <or= 0.05) with bazedoxifene compared with raloxifene 60 mg. CONCLUSION: Bazedoxifene was associated with a favorable endometrial, ovarian, and breast safety profile in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.",0
Pathology parameters and adjuvant tamoxifen response in a randomised premenopausal breast cancer trial.,"BACKGROUND: Subgroups of breast cancer that have an impaired response to endocrine treatment, despite hormone receptor positivity, are still poorly defined. Breast cancer can be subdivided according to standard pathological parameters including histological type, grade, and assessment of proliferation. These parameters are the net result of combinations of genetic alterations effecting tumour behaviour and could potentially reflect subtypes that respond differently to endocrine treatment. AIMS: To investigate the usefulness of these parameters as predictors of the response to tamoxifen in premenopausal women with breast cancer. MATERIALS/METHODS: Clinically established pathological parameters were assessed and related to the tamoxifen response in 500 available tumour specimens from 564 premenopausal patients with breast cancer randomised to either two years of tamoxifen or no treatment with 14 years of follow up. Proliferation was further evaluated by immunohistochemical Ki-67 expression. RESULTS: Oestrogen receptor positive ductal carcinomas responded as expected to tamoxifen, whereas the difference in recurrence free survival between control and tamoxifen treated patients was less apparent in the relatively few lobular carcinomas. For histological grade, there was no obvious difference in treatment response between the groups. The relation between proliferation and tamoxifen response seemed to be more complex, with a clear response in tumours with high and low proliferation, whereas tumours with intermediate proliferation defined by Ki-67 responded more poorly. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically established pathology parameters seem to mirror the endocrine treatment response and could potentially be valuable in future treatment decisions for patients with breast cancer.",0
Randomized trial of adjuvant ovarian suppression in 926 premenopausal patients with early breast cancer treated with adjuvant chemotherapy.,"PURPOSE: The aim of this multicenter trial was to evaluate the role of ovarian suppression in patients with early breast cancer previously treated with local surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nine hundred and twenty-six premenopausal patients with completely resected breast cancer and either axillary node involvement or histological grade 2 or 3 tumors were randomized after surgery to adjuvant chemotherapy alone (control arm) or adjuvant chemotherapy plus ovarian suppression (ovarian suppression arm). Ovarian suppression was obtained by either radiation-induced ovarian ablation or triptorelin for 3 years. The analyses were performed with Cox models stratified by center. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 9.5 years. Mean age was 43 years. Ninety per cent of patients had histologically proven positive axillary nodes, 63% positive hormonal receptors and 77% had received an anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen. Ovarian suppression was by radiation-induced ovarian ablation (45% of patients) or with triptorelin (48%). At the time of randomization, all patients had regular menses or their follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol levels indicated a premenopausal status. The 10-year disease-free survival rates were 49% [95% confidence interval (CI) 44% to 54%] in both arms (P = 0.51). The 10-year overall survival rates were 66% (95% CI 61% to 70%) for the ovarian suppression arm and 68% (95% CI 63% to 73%) for the control arm (P = 0.19). There were no variations in the treatment effect according to age, hormonal receptor status or ovarian suppression modality. However, in patients <40 years of age and with estrogen receptor-positive tumors, ovarian suppression significantly decreased the risk of recurrence (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this trial, after at least 10 years of follow-up, do not favor the use of ovarian suppression after adjuvant chemotherapy. The potential beneficial effect in younger women with hormono-dependent tumors should be further assessed.",0
Effect of adding gefitinib to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in estrogen receptor negative early breast cancer in a randomized phase II trial.,"Gefitinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has shown both anti-proliferative and anti-tumoral activity in breast cancer. This study was designed to determine the effect of adding gefitinib to neoadjuvant epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (EC) on tumor response rates. Women with unilateral, primary operable, estrogen receptor negative invasive breast cancer ≥ 2 cm were eligible for inclusion. Randomized patients were to receive four cycles of neoadjuvant EC plus 12 weeks of either gefitinib (250 mg daily) or placebo. Primary endpoint was pathologic complete response (pCR), and secondary endpoints were complete response (CR) and overall objective response (OR). 181 patients were randomized. A pCR was observed in 17% (12/71) of patients treated with gefitinib and in 12% (9/73) of patients treated with placebo (4.57% difference, 95% CI -7.19 to 6.33; P = 0.44). CR was observed in 10% of patients in both the gefitinib (7/71) and the placebo group (7/73) (0.27% difference, 95% CI -9.6 to 10.2; P = 0.96). There was no significant difference in OR (5.96%; 95% CI -9.9 to 21.9; P = 0.45) between the two groups. Post hoc subgroup analysis showed a significant difference in pCR between triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and non-TNBC tumors (P = 0.03). More patients in the gefitinib arm had hematological toxicity (P = 0.15) and discontinued treatment (9/94 vs. 2/86) because of adverse events (AE). Tumor response rates were similar in the two groups. A significantly higher pCR rate was observed post hoc in TNBC versus non-TNBC independent of treatment. More patients in the gefitinib group discontinued treatment because of AE.",1
Increased 5α-reductase type 2 expression in human breast carcinoma following aromatase inhibitor therapy: the correlation with decreased tumor cell proliferation.,"Tumor cell proliferation and progression of breast cancer are influenced by female sex steroids. However, not all breast cancer patients respond to aromatase inhibitors (AI), and many patients become unresponsive or relapse. Recent studies demonstrate that not only estrogens but also androgens may serve as regulators of estrogen-responsive as well as estrogen-unresponsive human breast cancers. However, the mechanism underlying these androgenic actions has remained relatively unknown. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the effects of AI upon the expression of enzymes involved in intratumoral androgen production including 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 5 (17βHSD5), 5α-reductase types 1 and 2 (5αRed1 and 5αRed2) as well as androgen receptor (AR) levels and correlated the findings with therapeutic responses including Ki67 labeling index (Ki67). Eighty-two postmenopausal invasive ductal carcinoma patients were enrolled in CAAN study from November 2001 to April 2004. Pre- and post-treatment specimens of 29 cases were available for this study. The status of 17βHSD5, 5αRed1, 5αRed2, and Ki67 in pre- and post-treatment specimens were evaluated. The significant increments of 5αRed2 as well as AR were detected in biological response group whose Ki67 LI decreased by more than 40% of the pre-treatment level. This is the first study demonstrating an increment of 5αRed2 and AR in the group of the patients associated with Ki67 decrement following AI treatment. These results suggest that increased 5αRed2 and AR following AI treatment may partly contribute to reduce the tumor cell proliferation through increasing intratumoral androgen concentrations and its receptor.",0
Four-year follow-up of trastuzumab plus adjuvant chemotherapy for operable human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer: joint analysis of data from NCCTG N9831 and NSABP B-31.,"PURPOSE: Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). The clinical benefits of adjuvant trastuzumab have been demonstrated in interim analyses of four large trials. Initial data of the combined analysis of the North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) N9831 Intergroup trial and National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-31 trial were reported in 2005. Long-term follow-up results on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) have been awaited. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with HER2-positive operable breast cancer were randomly assigned to doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel with or without trastuzumab in the NCCTG N9831 and NSABP B-31 trials. The similar design of both trials allowed data from the control and trastuzumab-containing arms to be combined in a joint analysis. RESULTS: At 3.9 years of median follow-up, there continues to be a highly statistically significant reduction in DFS event rate in favor of the trastuzumab-containing arm (P < .001). Similarly, there continues to be a statistically significant 39% reduction in death rate in favor of the trastuzumab-containing arm (P < .001). CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate consistent DFS and OS advantages of adjuvant trastuzumab over time, with the longest follow-up reported to date. The clinical benefits continue to outweigh the risks of adverse effects.",0
Role of immunohistochemical detection of lymph-node metastases in management of breast cancer. International Breast Cancer Study Group.,"BACKGROUND: This study was designed to ascertain whether immunohistochemical methods could improve the detection of metastases in primary breast-cancer patients whose axillary lymph nodes were classified, by conventional methods, as disease free. METHODS: Ipsilateral lymph nodes (negative for metastases by routine histology) from 736 patients (participants in Trial V of the International [Ludwig] Breast Cancer Study) were examined by serial sectioning and staining with haematoxylin and eosin (two sections from each of six levels) and by immunohistochemistry of a single section (with two anticytokeratins AE-1 and CAM 5.2). After median follow-up of 12 years, disease-free and overall survival were estimated by Kaplan-Meier methods. FINDINGS: Occult nodal metastases were detected by serial sectioning and haematoxylin and eosin in 52 (7%) of 736 patients and by immunohistochemistry in 148 (20%). Only two (3%) of 64 invasive lobular or mixed invasive lobular and ductal cancers had node micrometastases, detected by haematoxylin and eosin, compared with 25 (39%) by immunohistochemistry. Occult metastases, detected by either method, were associated with significantly poor disease-free and overall survival in postmenopausal but not in premenopausal patients. Immunohistochemically detected occult lymph-node metastases remained an independent and highly significant predictor of recurrence even after control for tumour grade, tumour size, oestrogen-receptor status, vascular invasion, and treatment assignment (hazard ratio 1.79 [95% CI 1.17-2.74], p=0.007). INTERPRETATION: The immunohistochemical examination of ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes is a reliable, prognostically valuable, and simple method for the detection of occult nodal metastases. Immunohistochemistry is recommended as a standard method of node examination in postmenopausal patients.",0
Expression of sialyl-Tn predicts the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy in node-positive breast cancer.,"Sialyl-Tn (STn) is a carcinoma-associated carbohydrate determinant expressed on cancer-associated mucins and has the structure NANA alpha(2-6)alpha GalNAc. Expression of STn in colon and ovarian cancer is associated with a poor prognosis independent of tumour grade, stage or histological type. We have examined 237 cases of primary breast cancer for expression of this antigen using the antibody HB-STn (Dako). The frequency of STn expression was 31% in the whole group, 36% in the node-negative and 28% in the node-positive group. Survival was lower, but not significantly so, in the STn-positive group (P = 0.07), but this effect was highly significant for patients with node-positive disease (P < 0.002), the curves for node-negative disease being coincident (P = 0.31). In node-positive disease the effect was limited to those receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (P = 0.001). In a multivariate (Cox) analysis on the whole group STn staining, combined with adjuvant chemotherapy, showed a highly significant correlation with survival. In STn-negative cases, adjuvant chemotherapy improved survival (relative risk 2.3, 95% confidence intervals 1.4-3.9), whereas adjuvant chemotherapy did not influence survival in patients which expressed STn (relative risk 1.1, 95% confidence intervals 0.6-2.2). Thus, by either direct or indirect mechanisms, STn positivity appears to be a marker of resistance to adjuvant chemotherapy.",0
Evaluation of risk factors predictive of nausea and vomiting with current standard-of-care antiemetic treatment: analysis of phase 3 trial of aprepitant in patients receiving adriamycin-cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy.,"GOALS OF WORK: A number of prognostic factors have been identified as risk factors for chemotherapy-induced emesis. This post-hoc analysis addressed whether: (1) these prognostic factors can identify a low-risk group for whom ondansetron plus dexamethasone alone provide a high level of protection (≥80% no emesis); (2) the NK1 receptor antagonist aprepitant improves antiemetic outcome regardless of emetic risk. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Breast cancer patients in a phase III double-blind, placebo-controlled trial were randomized to antiemetic regimens including ondansetron and dexamethasone, or aprepitant, ondansetron, and dexamethasone. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the impact on emesis (but not nausea) of the regimen with aprepitant, and previously reported risk factors, including age (<55 and ≥55 years), ethanol use (0-4 or ≥5 drinks/week), history of pregnancy-related morning sickness, and history of motion sickness, using a modified intent-to-treat approach. RESULTS: Treatment with aprepitant (P < 0.0001), older age (P = 0.006), ethanol use (P = 0.0048), and no history of morning sickness (P = 0.0007) were all significantly associated with reduced likelihood of emesis. The proportion of patients with one, two, or three risk factors who remained emesis free was significantly higher with the aprepitant-containing regimen than with the active control (70.2-82.8% vs. 38.6-66.4%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Aprepitant markedly improved control of emesis in patients with one or more risk factors. This analysis did not support using risk factors for modifying the antiemetic approach. A low-risk group with zero risk factors for whom aprepitant provided little benefit was of questionable clinical utility, since they comprised less than 3% of patients.",0
Occurrence of stroke with tamoxifen in NSABP B-24.,,0
Effect of tamoxifen on mammographic density.,"There are strong data showing that increased breast cancer risk is associated with increased mammographic density. Tamoxifen has been shown to decrease the risk of invasive breast cancer and decrease breast density. We sought to demonstrate and calculate the extent of change in mammographic density in women who have taken tamoxifen for up to 2 years. We evaluated mammograms from 28 high-risk women who were taking tamoxifen. Four different methods of evaluation were used: (a) two qualitative methods (Wolfe criteria and the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging and Reporting Data System criteria); (b) one semiquantitative method (mammograms were assigned one of five semiquantitative scores by visual inspection); and (c) one quantitative method (computer-aided calculation of fibroglandular area from digitized mammograms). The Wolfe criteria showed a 0.03 category decrease per year (P = 0.50). The American College of Radiology Breast Imaging and Reporting Data System criteria showed a 0.1 category decrease per year (P = 0.12). Semiquantitative criteria showed a 0.2 category decrease per year (P = 0.039). Digitized scores showed a 4.3% decrease per year (P = 0.0007). In conclusion, tamoxifen causes a decrease in mammographic density with use, an effect that is better quantitated with semiquantitative criteria or digitized images. Density change might become useful as a surrogate end point for the effect of tamoxifen and other chemopreventive measures, although our data do not predict an individual's degree of risk reduction.",0
Pathological complete response rates comparing 3 versus 6 cycles of epidoxorubicin and docetaxel in the neoadjuvant setting of patients with stage II and III breast cancer.,"We conducted a prospective randomized study to compare the results of 3 cycles of epidoxorubicin/docetaxel to 6 cycles of epidoxorubicin/docetaxel prior to surgery in breast cancer patients with clinical stages II and III. Forty-five patients eligible for neoadjuvant chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive either 3 (group 1) or 6 (group 2) cycles of epidoxorubicin/docetaxel prior to surgery. Chemotherapy consisted of epidoxorubicin 75 mg/m and docetaxel 75 mg/m on day 1 in 3-week cycles. The primary endpoint was the pathological complete response (pCR) rate; secondary endpoints were the rates of breast-conserving surgery and the axillary lymph node status in both groups. A pCR occurred in 10% (two of 20) in Group 1 and in 36% (nine of 25) in Group 2, which was statistically significant (p=0.045). Breast-conserving surgery could be performed in 70% (14 of 20) in Group 1 and in 76% (19 of 25) in Group 2 (p=0.065). Axillary lymph node status was negative in 45% (nine of 20) in Group 1 and 52% (13 of 25) in Group 2 (p=0.86). We conclude that 6 cycles of pre-operative epidoxorubicin/docetaxel versus 3 cycles of pre-operative epidoxorubicin/docetaxel significantly increases the pCR rates for breast cancer patients.",1
Effect of exemestane on the lipidemic profile of post-menopausal operable breast cancer patients following 5-7 years of adjuvant tamoxifen: preliminary results of the ATENA substudy.,"Long-term endocrine therapy for breast cancer may have clinical implications as drugs that potentially alter the lipid profile may increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. In this study, a companion subprotocol to the ATENA (Adjuvant post-Tamoxifen Exemestane versus Nothing Applied) trial, we compared the effect of the steroidal aromatase inactivator exemestane on the lipid profile of post-menopausal women with operable breast cancer in the adjuvant setting to that of observation alone following deprivation of 5-7 years primary treatment with tamoxifen. In this open-label, randomized, parallel group study, 340 post-menopausal patients with operable breast cancer who had been treated with tamoxifen for 5-7 years were randomized to either 5 additional years of exemestane (25 mg/day; n=172) or observation alone (n=168). Assessments of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and total serum triglycerides (TRG) were performed at baseline, and at 6 and 12 months. Total TRG levels were significantly reduced compared with baseline for the exemestane and the observational arm. Both total cholesterol and LDL levels were significantly increased above that of baseline values by 6 months, maintained through to 12 months, with no significant difference between the two treatment arms. There was no significant alteration observed for HDL over time or between the two arms. We conclude that sequential adjuvant treatment with exemestane in post-menopausal operable breast cancer patients following cessation of 5-7 years of tamoxifen does not appear to significantly alter the lipidemic profile for at least 12 months compared with an observational arm.",0
Tamoxifen for one year versus two years versus 6 months of Tamoxifen and 6 months of megestrol acetate: a randomized comparison in postmenopausal patients with high-risk breast cancer (DBCG 89C).,"From January 1, 1990 to December 31, 1994, DBCG conducted a randomised trial in 1 615 postmenopausal women with operable, high-risk, receptor-positive or -unknown breast cancer. The patients were after surgery randomised to Tamoxifen for 1 year (TAM1), Tamoxifen for 2 years (TAM 2) or Tamoxifen for 6 months followed by megestrol acetate for 6 months (TAM/MA). When the preplanned sample size of 1 500 patients was reached it was decided to continue randomisation to TAM1 or TAM2 and the study was finally closed December 31, 1996. With a median follow-up of more than 10 years, there was no difference in disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS) among the three treatment arms. Similar results were obtained in the original and extended comparisons of Tamoxifen for 1 versus 2 years. A multivariate analysis in the per-protocol treated patients did not show significant differences in hazard ratios for DFS or OS among the three arms. Side-effects were rare but more common in the TAM2 and TAM/MA arms.",1
Predictive value of syndecan-1 expression for the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy of primary breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: The overexpression of syndecan-1 in breast carcinomas correlates with poorer prognosis and an aggressive phenotype. The effect of syndecan-1 expression on tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was determined in locally advanced breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Semi-quantitative syndecan-1 immunohistochemistry was performed in pre-chemotherapy breast cancer biopsies of 37 patients undergoing high-dose neoadjuvant treatment with cyclophosphamide and epirubicin. RESULTS: 43.2% of breast carcinomas stained positive for syndecan-1. Syndecan-1 expression was more frequent in ductal invasive carcinomas than in other histological types (p=0.062). The pathological response to chemotherapy was decreased in syndecan-1-positive patients: 37.5% of syndecan-1-positive vs. 19% of syndecan-1-negative patients attained pathologically ""no change"". No syndecan-1-positive patient showed complete remission. Also, a correlation between syndecan-1 immunostaining intensity and response to chemotherapy was observed. Of the responding tumors, none showed strong syndecan-1 expression (Score 3+), whereas 20% of the non-responding tumors were strongly syndecan-1-positive. CONCLUSION: Syndecan-1-expressing breast carcinomas show a trend towards a decreased response to chemotherapy.",0
Adjuvant chemotherapy for elderly patients (> or =70 years) with early high-risk breast cancer: a retrospective analysis of 260 patients.,"BACKGROUND: Adjuvant chemotherapy in elderly women is currently perceived as one of the priorities in breast cancer (BC) research and, to date, we lack practical guidelines in this age group. Therefore we performed a retrospective analysis of the actual use of adjuvant chemotherapy according to each negative prognostic factor. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Charts of all consecutive elderly patients aged 70 years or more with operable BC referred to our institution between 1999 and 2003 were reviewed for tumour stage and treatment, and compared with an equal cohort of younger randomly selected postmenopausal patients (control group). RESULTS: A total of 260 elderly patients (mean age 75.6 years, age range 70-97 years) with histological diagnosis of early BC were eligible. Conserving surgery was performed in 54.6% of patients, nodal dissection in 84.6% and sentinel node biopsy in 5.8%. Tumour size was pT2-pT3 in 45.4% of patients; grading was G3 in 27.3%, hormonal status was negative (HR-) in 16.9% and lymph nodes were involved N+ in 36.1%. Of 188 patients presenting one or more risk factors (pT2-3, G3, N+, HR-), 48.4% were not proposed for adjuvant chemotherapy (compared with 7.2% in the control group), 39.8% of those with nodal involvement (compared with 4.3% of controls, P <0.0001) and 22.7% of those who were HR- (compared with 0.0% of controls, P=0.0002). Considering only patients receiving non-anthracycline-based chemotherapy, 20 elderly patients (25.9%) were unable to complete the planned number of cycles (compared with 4.7% of controls, P=0.0002). The 2-year disease-free survival was significantly decreased in N+ HR- patients compared with the remaining elderly patients (49.9% compared with 90.9%, P=0.0006). CONCLUSIONS: Elderly BC patients receive much less adjuvant chemotherapy, according to each prognostic factor. N+ HR- disease probably represents the most reasonable indication. As the toxicity of the CMF regimen frequently caused interruption of treatment, alternative regimens should be assessed in this age class.",0
The effect of LMWH (Nadroparin) on tumor progression.,"Recent clinical studies on patients with malignancies, who were treated with UHF and LMWHs raised the possibility, that these agents may possess an inhibitory effect on tumor progression. Further studies supported that this effect is independent from the anticoagulant and antithrombotic action. In this retrospective study oncological patients with an increased risk for thromboembolism were choosen, who received prophylactic treatment with an LMWH (nadroparin) at least for 6 months. Comparing with the control group, in some subgroups (T3 and T4, as well as M1) the LMWH-treated patients showed a significantly increased survival.",0
Phase II clinical trial of N-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)retinamide and tamoxifen administration before definitive surgery for breast neoplasia.,"PURPOSE: Surrogate end point biomarkers (SEBs) that can be measured in ductal carcinoma in situ or early-stage invasive cancer are needed to improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of chemoprevention trials. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We conducted a prospective study to develop SEBs for tamoxifen and N-[4-hydroxyphenyl]retinamide by administering either a placebo or both drugs for 2-4 weeks to women with ductal carcinoma in situ or early invasive cancers in the interval between the initial diagnostic core biopsy and definitive surgery. The major statistical end point of the study was pre- versus posttreatment change in cell proliferation, as measured by changes in Ki67 labeling indices. In addition, estrogen receptor (ER), HER2/neu, p53, retinoid receptors, and DNA index were measured. RESULTS: Between February 1997 and April 200, 52 patients were registered on the study, and 36 (20 in the placebo arm and 16 in the treatment arm) were available for analysis. No statistically significant pre- versus posttreatment differences in Ki67 labeling index or in the other markers were observed in the treatment arm compared with the placebo arm. There was a trend toward increased treatment response in ER-positive versus ER-negative patients, but this could not be rigorously analyzed because of the low sample size and the unequal distribution of ER-positive patients in the two study arms. CONCLUSION: Future SEB trials for breast carcinoma must (a) incorporate information about patient hormonal status into the study design and (b) resolve problems in patient accrual.",1
"tAnGo: a randomised phase III trial of gemcitabine in paclitaxel-containing, epirubicin/cyclophosphamide-based, adjuvant chemotherapy for early breast cancer: a prospective pulmonary, cardiac and hepatic function evaluation.","tAnGo is a large randomised trial assessing the addition of gemcitabine(G) to paclitaxel(T), following epirubicin(E) and cyclophosphamide(C) in women with invasive higher risk early breast cancer. To assess the safety and tolerability of adding G, a detailed safety substudy was undertaken. A total of 135 patients had cardiac, pulmonary and hepatic function assessed at (i) randomisation, (ii) mid-chemotherapy, (iii) immediately post-chemotherapy and (iv) 6 months post-chemotherapy. Skin toxicity was assessed during radiotherapy. No differences were detected in FEV(1) or FVC levels between treatment arms or time points. Diffusion capacity (TL(CO)) reduced during treatment (P<0.0001), with a significantly lower drop in EC-GT patients (P=0.02). Most of the reduction occurred during EC and recovered by 6-months post treatment. There was no difference in cardiac function between treatment arms. Only 11 patients had echocardiography/MUGA results change from normal to abnormal during treatment, with only five having LVEF<50%. Transient transaminitis occurred in both treatment arms with significantly more in EC-GT patients post-chemotherapy (AST P=0.03, ALT P=0.003), although the majority was low grade. There was no correlation between transaminitis and other toxicities. Both treatment regimens reported temporary reductions in pulmonary functions and transient transaminitis levels. Despite these being greater with EC-GT, both regimens appear well tolerated.",1
Protective effect of high-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate (HD-MPA) on hematological toxicity induced by chemotherapy for advanced solid tumors: a multicentric controlled clinical trial. MPA-Hematology Italian Cooperative Group.,"A multicenter, randomized, controlled trial was conducted comparing active treatment with placebo in 227 patients with breast, colorectal, lung and other solid forms of cancer. Combination therapy, (CT) conventionally employed for the various types of tumor involved, was associated with MPA (117 patients) or placebo (110 patients). MPA was given orally as tablets, as a dose of 500 mg b.i.d. for 6 months. The results were, briefly, as follows: The incidence of leukopenia was significantly lower in the groups receiving MPA in patients with breast and colorectal cancer (P less than 0.02). Tumors of the lung and other solid forms showed no such difference. The incidence of thrombocytopenia was the same in all disease groups. Objective responses (CR + PR) were observed in 23/46 (50%) of breast cancer patients treated with CT + MPA, and in 13/47 (28%) of those given CT + placebo. The difference was significant (P less than 0.02). Subjective parameters also showed more improvement in the MPA group than in the patients given CT alone. No significant differences were found for the other types of tumor, but the numbers in this population were very limited. In a group of 45 patients, antithrombin III a (%), antithrombin III R: Ag (%), plasminogen (mg/dl), alpha-2 macroglobulin (%), factor VIII C (%), factor VIII R: Ag (%) and factor IX C (%) were determined. The most interesting post-treatment findings were an increase in anti-thrombin III (activity and antigen level) and in plasminogen. This suggests that MPA does not increase the risk of thrombosis, and might even, to some extent, impede tumor-induced thrombophilia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0
Surgical complications of skin sparing mastectomy and immediate prosthetic reconstruction after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for invasive breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is gaining acceptance as an option for breast cancer treatment, particularly in young women. These women may seek immediate breast reconstruction after mastectomy even though it is not known whether such preoperative chemotherapy may be detrimental to post-reconstruction wound healing. Therefore, we set out to assess the influence of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for invasive breast cancer on the short-term complications after skin sparing mastectomy and immediate prosthetic reconstruction. METHODOLOGY: The short-term surgical outcome of 48 immediate breast reconstructions in 37 women treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy from 2006 through 2009 was prospectively compared to that of 215 immediate reconstructions in 176 women who were operated in the same period without neoadjuvant chemotherapy. RESULTS: The overall rate of short-term postoperative complications was significantly less among neoadjuvantly treated women (15% vs. 29%; p = 0.042) but this did not result in a reduction of loss of prostheses (8% vs. 11%; p = 0.566). CONCLUSION: Because neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not associated with an increase in short-term complications after skin sparing mastectomy and immediate prosthetic reconstruction in patients with invasive breast cancer, such combined surgical therapy may be offered as treatment option for this particular group of patients also.",0
Docetaxel versus docetaxel alternating with gemcitabine as treatments of advanced breast cancer: final analysis of a randomised trial.,"BACKGROUND: Alternating administration of docetaxel and gemcitabine might result in improved time-to-treatment failure (TTF) and fewer adverse events compared with single-agent docetaxel as treatment of advanced breast cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women diagnosed with advanced breast cancer were randomly allocated to receive 3-weekly docetaxel (group D) or 3-weekly docetaxel alternating with 3-weekly gemcitabine (group D/G) until treatment failure as first-line chemotherapy. The primary end point was TTF.RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty-seven subjects were assigned to treatment (group D, 115; group D/G, 122). The median TTF was 5.6 and 6.2 months in groups D and D/G, respectively (hazard ratio 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.63-1.16; P = 0.31). There was no significant difference in time-to-disease progression, survival, and response rate between the groups. When adverse events were evaluated for the worst toxicity encountered during treatment, there was little difference between the groups, but when they were assessed per cycle, alternating treatment was associated with fewer severe (grade 3 or 4) adverse effects (P = 0.013), and the difference was highly significant for cycles when gemcitabine was administered in group D/G (P < 0.001).CONCLUSION: The alternating regimen was associated with a similar TTF as single-agent docetaxel but with fewer adverse effects during gemcitabine cycles.",1
Can breast MRI predict axillary lymph node metastasis in women undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy.,"BACKGROUND: Axillary lymph node status provides important staging information. We sought to evaluate the predictive value of breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in detecting axillary lymph node metastases prior to initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and in detecting residual lymph node metastases after NAC in women found to be node positive prior to NAC. METHODS: Women underwent breast MRI with axillary evaluation prior to initiation of NAC and again after completion of NAC. Pathologic confirmation of lymph node status was confirmed by sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), image-guided axillary fine-needle aspiration (FNA)/core biopsy, or axillary lymph node dissection. We evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values of MRI in detecting axillary node involvement. RESULTS: Seventy-four women completed NAC and underwent surgery. Sensitivity of MRI in detecting axillary node involvement prior to NAC was 64.7% and specificity was 100%, with positive and negative predictive values of MRI of 100% and 77.8%, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of MRI to identify residual pathologic axillary lymph node disease following NAC were 85.7% and 89%, respectively, while the positive and negative predictive values were 92% and 80.9%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Breast MRI has moderate sensitivity and high specificity for predicting axillary lymph node status prior to NAC. In patients found to be node positive prior to NAC, MRI was able to predict with moderate sensitivity and specificity whether residual nodal disease was present. The accuracy of MRI is not adequate to obviate either the need for staging by sentinel node biopsy or the need for completion axillary dissection in women determined to be node positive prior to NAC.",0
"Gene expression profiling of breast cancer patients treated with docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide within the GEPARTRIO trial: HER-2, but not topoisomerase II alpha and microtubule-associated protein tau, is highly predictive of tumor response.","Gene expression analysis in breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy is an interesting tool for identification of gene signatures and new markers to predict tumor response. However, the detection of predictive markers strongly depends on the drugs used in the specific therapeutic setting. There is growing evidence that topoisomerase II-alpha (TOPO IIalpha) is a marker for anthracycline-, and microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) for taxane sensitivity. HER-2 has been described as a marker of both anthracycline and taxane sensitivity. We performed gene expression profiling of 50 patients within the GEPARTRIO study, an anthracycline and taxane neoadjuvant chemotherapy trial. Here we investigate the predictive value of TOPO IIalpha, MAPT and HER-2 mRNA expression for pathological complete response (pCR) in this setting. Interestingly, HER-2 gene expression was strongly predictive of pCR (P=0.017) as well as overall response (P=0.037) and clinical complete response (cCR, P=0.050). In contrast, for both TOPO IIalpha and MAPT no correlation with pCR was observed in our sample group.",0
Evaluation of trastuzumab without chemotherapy as a post-operative adjuvant therapy in HER2-positive elderly breast cancer patients: randomized controlled trial [RESPECT (N-SAS BC07)].,"OBJECTIVE: This trial is conducted to investigate the benefit of trastuzumab monotherapy compared with a combination therapy of trastuzumab and chemotherapy in women over 70 years with human epidermal growth factor receptor type-2-positive primary breast cancer. METHODS: Inclusion criteria are the following: histologically diagnosed as invasive breast cancer and received curative operation for primary breast cancer; Stage I, IIA, IIB or IIIA/M0; and baseline left ventricular ejection fraction is ≥55%. Patients are randomized to receive either trastuzumab (8 mg/kg loading dose, 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 1 year) plus chemotherapy selected from regimens specified on the protocol or trastuzumab monotherapy. The primary endpoint is disease-free survival. Secondary endpoints are overall survival, relapse-free survival, safety, health-related quality of life, comprehensive geriatric assessment and cost effectiveness. RESULTS: Patients recruitment has been commenced in October 2009. Enrollment of 300 patients is planned during the 4-year recruitment period. CONCLUSIONS: We hereby report the study concept.",1
Pathologic complete response with six compared with three cycles of neoadjuvant epirubicin plus docetaxel and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in operable breast cancer: results of ABCSG-14.,"PURPOSE: Preoperative (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy for operable breast cancer downstages tumors initially not suitable for breast-conserving surgery. A pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be a surrogate for longer overall survival, but this beneficial effect remains to be established. This phase III trial evaluated whether doubling the number of cycles of neoadjuvant treatment increased the pCR rate. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with biopsy-proven breast cancer (T1-4a-c, N+/-, M0; stage I to III) were eligible and randomly assigned to either three or six cycles of epirubicin 75 mg/m2 and docetaxel 75 mg/m2 on day 1 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor on days 3 through 10 (ED+G), every 21 days. The primary end point was the pCR rate of the breast tumor. Secondary end points were pathologic nodal status after surgery and the rate of breast-conserving surgery. RESULTS: A total of 292 patients were accrued, and 288 patients were assessable for efficacy and safety. Groups were well balanced for known prognostic factors. Six cycles of ED+G, compared with three cycles, resulted in a significantly higher pCR rate (18.6% v 7.7%, respectively; P = .0045), a higher percentage of patients with negative axillary status (56.6% v 42.8%, respectively; P = .02), and a trend towards more breast-conserving surgery (75.9% v 66.9%, respectively; P = .10). Rates of adverse events were similar, and no patients died on treatment. CONCLUSION: Doubling the number of neoadjuvant ED+G cycles from three to six results in higher rates of pCR and negative axillary nodal status with no excess of adverse effects. Thus, six cycles of ED+G should be the standard neoadjuvant treatment for operable breast cancer if this combination is chosen.",1
Prospective multicenter randomized phase III study of weekly versus standard docetaxel plus doxorubicin (D4) for first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: Previous phase II studies have indicated a greatly reduced hematotoxicity of docetaxel-based regimens administered on weekly schedules. The present trial was initiated to compare the toxicity and efficacy of weekly docetaxel versus its standard 3-weekly application in combination with doxorubicin.METHODS: Patients previously untreated with chemotherapy for metastatic disease were recruited. Inclusion criteria were age <65 years or a Karnofsky Performance Status of 70-100%. All patients in the D4 study received doxorubicin (50 mg/m(2)) on the first day of treatment in addition to docetaxel given either at a 3-weekly dose of 75 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks (q3w) or at a weekly dose of 35 mg/m(2) (days 1, 8, and 15; q4w). Treatment was continued until a maximum of 8 cycles, unacceptable toxicity, or disease progression. All patients received standard corticosteroid prophylaxis.RESULTS: Since interim analysis showed failure to reach a significant difference for the primary endpoint (hematotoxicity, i.e. leukopenia), the study was closed according to the study protocol (85 of 242 patients). A lower-than-expected rate of leukopenia ≥ grade 3 was observed in the standard arm of the D4 study compared to the weekly schedule (per-patient analysis: 61.9% q3w vs. 65.1% q1w; p > 0.05). Grade 3 and grade 4 fever, diarrhea, and infections occurred more frequently in the standard arm, whereas neurotoxicity and skin/nail disorders were observed more frequently in the weekly arm. Except for fever, none of these differences reached a level of significance. Dose delays, dose reductions, and the rate of omitted doses were increased in the weekly arm. The overall response rate was 44.2% in the weekly arm compared to 52.4% in the standard arm (p = 0.52). Time to progression was 6.2 (q1w) versus 10.3 (q3w) months (p = 0.36), and overall survival was 20.5 (q1w) versus 28.7 (q3w) months (p = 0.98).CONCLUSION: The present data support the feasibility of both weekly and 3-weekly application of docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin. Nevertheless, given that leukopenia was similar in both arms and the efficacy parameters were at least numerically inferior with the weekly schedule, standard 3-weekly application seems to be preferable for patients requiring combination chemotherapy.",1
Sustained-release metoclopramide plus methylprednisolone versus placebo plus methylprednisolone as antiemetic prophylaxis during non-cisplatin chemotherapy. A randomized double-blind cross-over trial.,"In a randomized double-blind cross-over trial, sustained-release metoclopramide (S) plus methylprednisolone (M) was compared with placebo (P) plus methylprednisolone as antiemetic prophylaxis during two cycles of non-cisplatin chemotherapy. S was administered as 60 mg every 12 h commencing on the evening before chemotherapy up to total of 300 mg metoclopramide in 2.5 days. Evaluation of nausea and vomiting was done by self-assessment schemes and visual analog scales. Fifty patients were included and 36 fulfilled both cycles. Mild nausea and vomiting were experienced by 81% and 83% in the S + M and P + M groups, respectively, while 42% and 39% showed complete control of nausea and vomiting during the first day of treatment. Moderate-dose S did not add to the antiemetic efficacy of M in non-cisplatin chemotherapeutic regimens.",0
The prognostic significance of sialyl-Tn antigen in women treated with breast carcinoma treated with adjuvant chemotherapy.,"BACKGROUND: Sialyl-Tn (STn) represents an aberrantly glycosylated mucin epitope that is expressed in breast carcinoma and other adenocarcinomas and is an important factor in the development of novel immunotherapeutic approaches. The primary aim of the current study was to investigate the influence of STn expression on the prognoses of patients with breast carcinoma. METHODS: A cohort of 207 women diagnosed with invasive breast carcinoma who were treated with anthracycline-containing adjuvant chemotherapy and were enrolled in a randomized clinical trial were studied. Expression of STn was determined by an immunohistochemical procedure in which the B72.3 monoclonal antibody was used. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional regression survival analyses were used to compare low STn and high STn patients. RESULTS: Forty-eight (23%) of the 207 specimens demonstrated high STn staining (>25% cells were immunoreactive). During a median follow-up of 5 years, high STn patients had worse disease free survival than low STn patients (55% vs. 74%, respectively; P = 0.03). High STn expression was significantly associated with age (P = 0.04) but not with other conventional prognostic markers. In multivariate analysis using the Cox regression model, high STn emerged as an independent prognostic indicator for disease free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 2.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-3.73) and for overall survival (HR, 2.16; 95% CI, 0.95-4.92). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that STn may be a valuable marker for identifying women at high risk of developing recurrent breast carcinoma who may be candidates for trials investigating new therapies in combination with standard adjuvant therapy.",0
A randomized controlled trial comparing intrathecal sustained-release cytarabine (DepoCyt) to intrathecal methotrexate in patients with neoplastic meningitis from solid tumors.,"Standard treatment for neoplastic meningitis requires frequent intrathecal (IT) injections of chemotherapy and is only modestly effective. DepoCyt is a sustained-release formulation of cytarabine that maintains cytotoxic concentrations of the drug in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for more than 14 days after a single 50-mg injection. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of DepoCyt versus methotrexate in patients with solid tumor neoplastic meningitis. Sixty-one patients with histologically proven cancer and positive CSF cytologies were randomized to receive IT DepoCyt (31 patients) or IT methotrexate (30 patients). Patients received up to six 50-mg doses of DepoCyt or up to sixteen 10-mg doses of methotrexate over 3 months. Treatment arms were well balanced with respect to demographic and disease-related characteristics. Responses occurred in 26% of DepoCyt-treated and 20% of methotrexate-treated patients (P = 0.76). Median survival was 105 days in the DepoCyt arm and 78 days in the methotrexate arm (log-rank P = 0.15). The DepoCyt group experienced a greater median time to neurological progression (58 versus 30 days; log-rank P = 0.007) and longer neoplastic meningitis-specific survival (log-rank P = 0.074; median meningitis-specific survival, 343 versus 98 days). Factors predictive of longer progression-free survival included absence of visible central nervous system disease on neuroimaging studies (P<0.001), longer pretreatment duration of CSF disease (P<0.001), history of intraparenchymal tumor (P<0.001), and treatment with DepoCyt (P = 0.002). The frequency and grade of adverse events were comparable between treatment arms. In patients with solid tumor neoplastic meningitis, DepoCyt produced a response rate comparable to that of methotrexate and significantly increased the time to neurological progression while offering the benefit of a less demanding dose schedule.",0
Predictive value of relative changes in serum total sialic acid level for response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced breast carcinoma.,"The aim of this study was to determine whether relative changes in total serum sialic acid (TSA) levels are associated with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced breast carcinoma (LABC) patients. Forty-seven patients with stage III-B breast carcinoma and 20 healthy subjects (controls) were included to the study. TSA levels were determined in serum from patients at baseline and after completion of preoperative chemotherapy. Pathological responses to chemotherapy were determined on specimens of modified radical mastectomy underwent in responders. Association between the relative changes in serum TSA levels and the pathological response to chemotherapy was investigated. The baseline mean serum TSA level of LABC patients was 88.6+/-0.6 mg/dl and 66.9+/-0.7 mg/dl for the control group (p<0.0001). After 3 cycles chemotherapy, the serum levels of TSA were markedly decreased with pathological partial response (pPR) (73.8+/-1.0 mg/dl) and complete response (pCR) (68.1+/-1.9 mg/dl) compared to baseline values (p<0.05). In 8 non-responders, mean TSA value was 88.9+/-1.1 mg/dl (p=0.9 for pretreatment vs posttreatment TSA levels). Of 39 responders, 6 had pathological complete response (pCR) and remaining had pathological partial response (pPR). TSA levels derived from patients with pCR and from those with pPR were 68.1+/-1.9 mg/dl and 73.8+/-1.0 mg/dl, respectively (p=0.03). While TSA levels from pCR were not different from those of controls (p=0.4), there was a significant difference between TSA levels from pPR and from controls (p<0.0001). A significant correlation was demonstrated between the relative changes in TSA levels and pathological response (p<0.0001, coefficient of correlation [rs]=0.81). The ROC analysis showed that the discriminating ability was satisfactory and relative decrease by more than 21% in TSA levels indicated a pCR with the sensitivity by 83%, specificity by 76%. In conclusion, there is a significant correlation between the relative changes in TSA levels by chemotherapy and clinical/ pathological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in LABC patients.",0
A prospective randomized trial of thymopentin versus granulocyte--colony stimulating factor with or without thymopentin in the prevention of febrile episodes in cancer patients undergoing highly cytotoxic chemotherapy.,"One hundred patients with advanced carcinoma undergoing highly cytotoxic chemotherapy were enrolled in a prospective randomized trial comparing subcutaneous G-CSF, thymopentin, a combination of the two, and placebo as preventive treatment of febrile leukopenia. Data from this study show that G-CSF was very active in reducing the incidence of chemotherapy-related fever and leukopenia as compared to placebo (22% versus 64%). This difference was statistically highly significant (P < 0.001). Thymopentin was associated with a reduction in febrile episodes as compared to placebo (52% versus 64%), but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Moreover, the addition of thymopentin to G-CSF did not result in a statistically significant improvement of results obtained with G-CSF alone. Similar results were achieved for fungal infections. Tolerance to thymopentin was excellent, while less than 9% of patients on G-CSF treatment complained of mild nausea and generalized bone pain.",0
Kinetics of serum HER-2/neu changes in patients with HER-2-positive primary breast cancer after initiation of primary chemotherapy.,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of the study was to determine the utility of quantitation of the extracellular domain (ECD) of the HER-2/neu receptor in the serum for predicting response to treatment in patients with primary breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant therapy. METHODS: HER-2/neu ECD was measured in sera obtained from 39 patients with HER-2-amplified stage II-III primary breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned to either 4 cycles of paclitaxel followed by 4 cycles of fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC) (n = 10) or to the same chemotherapy with simultaneous weekly trastuzumab for 24 weeks (n = 29). Changes in HER-2 ECD were monitored with the Bayer HER-2/neu assay over 6 months and correlated with pathological response to treatment. RESULTS: Before initiation of chemotherapy, 28.2% of patients had elevated concentration of the HER-2 ECD (>15 ng/mL). The median baseline serum HER-2 ECD concentration was 13.6 ng/mL (mean +/- SD, 20.3 +/- 35.5 ng/mL). A decrease in the median HER-2 ECD levels from baseline to Week 3 and from baseline to Week 6 of chemotherapy was seen regardless of treatment regimen. No significant difference in baseline HER-2 ECD levels was observed between the groups who achieved pathological complete response (pCR) and the group with residual disease (P = .41). However, a 9% drop from Week 3 to Week 6 after initial chemotherapy was predictive of pCR (P = .04). CONCLUSION: A decrease in serum HER-2 ECD levels early during treatment was associated with pathological response in patients receiving primary chemotherapy, particularly trastuzumab-based regimens. Serum HER-2 ECD levels may serve to monitor neoadjuvant therapy in HER-2-positive primary breast cancer.",0
A randomized phase II trial of doxorubicin plus pemetrexed followed by docetaxel versus doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel as neoadjuvant treatment of early breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) before surgery is a standard option for patients with early breast cancer (EBC) that allows in vivo chemosensitivity testing. Given the promising activity of pemetrexed plus doxorubicin in metastatic breast cancer, it was reasonable to evaluate the utility of this combination as part of an NST regimen in EBC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with untreated operable T2-T4a-c N0-2 M0 breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive either four cycles of pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) plus doxorubicin 60 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks (q3w) followed by four cycles of docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) q3w (AP-D) or four cycles of doxorubicin 60 mg/m(2) plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) q3w followed by four cycles of docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) q3w (AC-D). Surgery was carried out within 2 months after last chemotherapy. Primary end point was pathological complete response (pCR) rate in the breast. Secondary end points included clinical response rate, rate of histologically negative axillary lymph nodes, toxicity, and disease-free survival.RESULTS: From September 2005 to August 2007, 257 patients were randomly allocated to 17 sites. Median age was 48 and 49 years for AP-D and AC-D, respectively. Overall pCR rates were 16.5% for AP-D and 20.2% for AC-D. With AP-D, pCR rate was 17.8% for hormone receptor (HR)-negative patients and 15.9% for HR-positive patients. With AC-D, pCR rates were 42.9% and 7.8% for HR-negative and HR-positive patients, respectively. Clinical response rates were 59.5% in the AP-D group and 68.1% in the AC-D group. The rate of histologically negative axillary lymph nodes was 53% in both groups. Both treatments were well tolerated. Median disease-free survival is currently not mature.CONCLUSIONS: AP-D and AC-D are well tolerated and active as NST in EBC. Of note, AC-D had a higher pCR rate in HR-negative tumors, whereas AP-D had more activity if HRs were expressed.",1
"Primary breast cancer: mammographic changes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with pathologic correlation.","PURPOSE: To correlate changes depicted at mammography during neo-adjuvant chemotherapy for operable breast carcinoma with subsequent pathologic status. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients (n = 107) underwent mammography before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, prior to surgery. Four retrospectively determined grades of response at mammography included complete, mammographic (decreased size and/or density), stable disease, or progressive disease. RESULTS: In 95 fully assessable patients, grade of response to chemotherapy was complete in eight (9%), mammographic in 78 (82%), stable disease in seven (7%), and progressive disease in two (2%). Before and after treatment, respectively, 64 (67%) and 20 (21%) masses were greater than 2 cm in bidimensional diameter. Response was not complete in any of the 44 (46%) cases of microcalcifications. At histologic examination after surgery in 95 fully assessable patients, five of eight patients with complete response were found to have residual tumor (three with an invasive component); eight were found to have no residual tumor (response in three was complete; in four, mammographic; and in one, stable disease). CONCLUSION: Whereas mammograms in most patients showed some response to chemotherapy, prediction of pathologic outcome was not possible.",0
Prospective randomised multicenter trial on single fraction radiotherapy (8 Gy x 1) versus multiple fractions (3 Gy x 10) in the treatment of painful bone metastases.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To investigate whether single-fraction radiotherapy is equal to multiple fractions in the treatment of painful metastases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study planned to recruit 1000 patients with painful bone metastases from four Norwegian and six Swedish hospitals. Patients were randomized to single-fraction (8 Gy x 1) or multiple-fraction (3 Gy x 10) radiotherapy. The primary endpoint of the study was pain relief, with fatigue and global quality of life as the secondary endpoints. RESULTS: The data monitoring committee recommended closure of the study after 376 patients had been recruited because interim analyses indicated that, as in two other recently published trials, the treatment groups had similar outcomes. Both groups experienced similar pain relief within the first 4 months, and this was maintained throughout the 28-week follow-up. No differences were found for fatigue and global quality of life. Survival was similar in both groups, with median survival of 8-9 months. CONCLUSIONS: Single-fraction 8 Gy and multiple-fraction radiotherapy provide similar pain benefit. These results, confirming those of other studies, indicate that single-fraction 8 Gy should be standard management policy for these patients.",0
Identifying patients at high risk for neutropenic complications during chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer with doxorubicin or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin: the development of a prediction model.,"OBJECTIVE: To develop a cycle-based risk prediction model for neutropenic complications (NC) during chemotherapy with doxorubicin (DOX) or a pegylated liposomal formulation (PLD) for patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). METHODS: Data analyzed was from a phase III, randomized clinical trial of DOX (60 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks) or PLD (50 mg/m(2) every 4 weeks) for the first line therapy for MBC (n = 509) (O'Brien et al, Ann Oncol. 2004;15:440-449). NC were defined as an absolute neutrophil count < or =1.5 x 10(9) cells/L (ie, > or =grade II) before the next cycle, febrile neutropenia or neutropenia with a documented infection. Patient and hematologic factors potentially associated with NC were evaluated. Factors with a P value of < or =0.25 within a cycle were included in a generalized estimating equations regression model. Using backward elimination, we derived a risk scoring algorithm (range 0-63) from the final reduced model. RESULTS: Risk factors retained in the model included poor performance status, absolute neutrophil count < or =2.0 x 10(9) cells/L in the previous cycle, the first cycle of chemotherapy, DOX versus PLD and advanced age. A precycle risk score from > or =25 to <40 for a given patient was identified as being the optimal threshold for sensitivity (58.0%) and specificity (78.7%). Patients with a score at or beyond this threshold would be considered at high risk for developing NC in later cycles. CONCLUSION: The use of this model may enhance patient care by targeting preventative therapies (eg, granulocyte colony stimulating factor or PLD) to those MBC patients most likely to experience NC during anthracycline-based chemotherapy.",0
Vitamin E for prophylaxis against chemotherapy-induced neuropathy: a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: The authors conducted a pilot, randomized, open label with blind assessment, controlled trial to determine whether vitamin E supplementation has a neuroprotective effect in chemotherapy-induced peripheral nerve damage. METHODS: Thirty-one patients with cancer treated with six courses of cumulative cisplatin, paclitaxel, or their combination regimens were randomly assigned in two groups and followed by neurologic examination and electrophysiologic study. Patients assigned in Group I (n = 16) received oral vitamin E at a daily dose of 600 mg/day during chemotherapy and 3 months after its cessation were compared to patients of Group II (n = 15), who received no supplementation and served as controls. The severity of neurotoxicity was summarized by means of a modified peripheral neuropathy score. RESULTS: The incidence of neurotoxicity differed between the two groups, occurring in 4/16 (25%) patients assigned in the vitamin E supplementation group and in 11/15 (73.3%) patients assigned in the control group (p = 0.019). Mean peripheral neuropathy scores were 3.4 +/- 6.3 for patients of Group I and 11.5 +/- 10.6 for patients of Group II (p = 0.026). The relative risk (RR) of developing neurotoxicity was significantly higher in case of control patients, RR = 0.34, 95% CI = 0.14 to 0.84. CONCLUSION: Vitamin E supplementation in cancer patients may have an important neuroprotective effect.",0
"Dose-dense adjuvant chemotherapy in node-positive breast cancer: docetaxel followed by epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (T/EC), or the reverse sequence (EC/T), every 2 weeks, versus docetaxel, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (TEC) every 3 weeks. AERO B03 randomized phase II study.","BACKGROUND: Adding a taxane to anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy prolongs survival in node-positive patients but optimal dose and schedule remain undetermined. This study aimed to select a dose-dense regimen for further assessment in phase III studies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-nine patients with node-positive invasive breast adenocarcinoma were randomly assigned to docetaxel (Taxotere) (T) 75 mg/m2, epirubicin (E) 75 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide (C) 500 mg/m2 (TEC)x6, every 3 weeks; E 100 mg/m2, C 600 mg/m2 x 4, then T 100 mg/m2 x 4 (EC-->T) or the reverse sequence (T-->EC), every 2 weeks, with pegfilgrastim support. The primary end point was the incidence of grade 4 toxicity. RESULTS: Dose intensity was almost doubled with dose-dense regimens, compared with TEC. Twenty-seven patients experienced grade 4 toxicity: 26%, 40% and 18% with TEC, EC-->T and T-->EC, respectively, mainly neutropenia, but febrile neutropenia occurred only in 11%, 10% and 3%. Grade 3-4 nail disorders, hand-foot syndrome and peripheral neuropathy occurred in 46%, 73% and 68% of patients with TEC, EC-->T and T-->EC, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Dose-dense regimens yield more frequent and severe nonhematological toxic effects than standard dose TEC regimen. Though grade 4 toxicity rates appear acceptable with the T-->EC regimen, the incidence of grade 3-4 events makes it difficult to recommend either dose-dense regimen for further investigation.",1
A prospective randomized trial to evaluate different oral dose regimens of medroxyprogesterone acetate in women with advanced breast cancer.,"A prospective randomized study was conducted to try to answer two questions: is a loading dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate (1000 mg p.o. q.d.s. for 48 h) superior to conventional dosing; and does an oral maintenance dose of 1000 mg daily offer any advantage over 500 mg daily in women with advanced breast cancer who have failed to respond to, or have relapsed after, tamoxifen? Of 211 patients randomized, 207 were evaluable. There was no improvement in response rates, time to response, response duration or overall survival as a result of the loading dose. When comparing high and low maintenance doses, there was a significant difference in response rates (48% versus 32%; chi 2 = 10.09, df = 2, P = 0.006) and survival (66% versus 41% alive at 12 months; chi 2 = 9.06, df = 1, P = 0.003) in favour of the higher dose regimen, although there was no significant difference in the duration of response. There was no additional toxicity attributable to the loading dose regimen, but side effects were more frequent with the high dose maintenance schedule (141 of 201 adverse effects occurring in these two groups) although the incidence of severe toxicity was similar with both high dose and low dose treatments.",0
"Biweekly gemcitabine-paclitaxel, gemcitabine-carboplatin, or gemcitabine-cisplatin as first-line treatment in metastatic breast cancer after anthracycline failure: a phase II randomized selection trial.","BACKGROUND: The primary objective of this multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel, phase II selection trial was to compare the objective tumor response to biweekly (every 2 weeks) gemcitabine/paclitaxel, gemcitabine/carboplatin, and gemcitabine/cisplatin as first-line treatment for metastatic breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients with stage IV disease who relapsed after anthracycline failure were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to gemcitabine (2,500 mg/m2) plus paclitaxel 150 mg/m2 (n = 49); plus carboplatin, area under the curve = 2.5 mg/mL × min (n = 47); or plus cisplatin 50 mg/m2 (n = 51). Study therapy continued up until a maximum of 8 cycles and follow-up continued for 24 months. RESULTS: All patients were analyzed for efficacy and one patient was excluded from the safety analyses. The objective response was 26.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) 14.9-41.1] for gemcitabine/paclitaxel, 17.0% (95% CI 7.6-30.8) for gemcitabine/carboplatin, and 15.7% (95% CI 7.0-28.6) for gemcitabine/cisplatin. The adjusted odds ratio for tumor response was 0.33 (95% CI 0.10-1.06), P = 0.063 for gemcitabine/carboplatin versus gemcitabine/paclitaxel; 0.26 (95% CI 0.08-0.86), P = 0.027 for gemcitabine/cisplatin versus gemcitabine/paclitaxel; and 0.77 (95% CI 0.24-2.52), P = 0.671 for gemcitabine/cisplatin versus gemcitabine/carboplatin. There were no significant differences in overall survival or progression-free survival (P > 0.05). Grade 3 or 4 drug-related adverse events varied between groups and the majority of deaths (94.9%; 74/78) were related to disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: The gemcitabine-based treatments had comparable activity and tolerability. Similar survival characteristics and different toxicity profiles suggested that gemcitabine-platinum may be evaluated further in patients after anthracycline failure.",1
A comparative study of exemestane versus anastrozole in patients with postmenopausal breast cancer with visceral metastases.,"PURPOSE: Patients developing visceral breast cancer metastases generally receive chemotherapy rather than endocrine therapy. Recent aromatase inhibitor studies have reported activity in such patients; therefore, this study formally evaluated anastrozole and exemestane in postmenopausal patients in this setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer and > or = 1 visceral (liver or lung) lesion were randomized to anastrozole (1 mg/day orally) or exemestane (25 mg/day orally) for > or = 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was objective response in visceral lesions based on modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Secondary endpoints included clinical benefit (objective response plus stable disease > or = 180 days), overall survival, and adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 130 patients were enrolled, and 128 patients (64 anastrozole, 64 exemestane) were included in the intent-to-treat analysis. Accrual delays caused study closure before the target enrollment (N = 200) was reached, limiting the statistical power of the study. Objective response in visceral sites was approximately 15% in both groups. Clinical benefit in visceral sites was 32% of the patients treated with anastrozole and 38% of the patients treated with exemestane. Median survival was 33.3 months and 30.5 months in the anastrozole and exemestane groups, respectively. Toxicities were similar to those previously reported; however, treatment-related adverse events were more frequent with anastrozole (41%) than with exemestane (31%). Both treatments were generally well tolerated in patients with postmenopausal breast cancer with visceral metastases. CONCLUSION: Efficacy was similar in both treatment groups for all endpoints. Aromatase inhibitors can be considered as a treatment option in postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive visceral breast cancer metastases.",0
A randomized phase II study of sequential docetaxel and doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide in patients with metastatic breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Docetaxel has yielded promising response rates as a component of doxorubicin-based combination schedules in patients with metastatic breast cancer, including docetaxel/doxorubicin and docetaxel/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC). This randomized two-stage phase II study was conducted to evaluate sequential treatment with docetaxel and AC as first-line treatment in patients with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer previously untreated with chemotherapy for metastatic disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-three patients were randomized to either docetaxel (100 mg/m(2)) on day 1 of a 21-day cycle for three cycles followed by AC (60/600 mg/m(2)) on day 1 of a 21-day cycle for three cycles (n = 17) or vice-versa (n = 16), without prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support. In addition, we compared pre-treatment serum sErbB1 and sErbB2 protein concentrations with that of an age- and menopausal status-matched group of healthy women, and examined changes in serum sErbB1 and sErbB2 protein concentrations in these two treatment schedules. Data from each one of the two arms of the trial (docetaxel then AC, or AC and then docetaxel) were analyzed separately. RESULTS: Enrollment was suspended after the first-stage of accrual, based on statistical design. Confirmed objective response rates after six cycles of treatment were 35% [95% confidence interval (CI) 14% to 62%] with docetaxel then AC and 38% (95% CI 15% to 65%) with AC then docetaxel. Dose reductions were frequent and mostly due to grade 4 neutropenia. Median survival time was 2.5 years in the docetaxel then AC group, and 1.1 years in the AC then docetaxel group. Serum sErbB1 concentrations were not significantly different between the study patients and healthy women, and did not change significantly after three and six cycles of treatment. In contrast, serum sErbB2 concentrations were significantly higher in the study patients compared with healthy women and tended to decrease after three and six cycles of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Response rates at the end of six cycles of treatment, which led to termination of accrual after the first stage using either the sequence of docetaxel first or docetaxel after AC chemotherapy, were lower than anticipated. However, median survival times and median progression-free survival times are similar to those reported in other studies. These data further suggest that additional studies to assess whether serum sErbB2 concentrations are useful predictors of responsiveness to chemotherapy are warranted.",1
"Improved disease-free survival with epirubicin-based chemoendocrine adjuvant therapy compared with tamoxifen alone in one to three node-positive, estrogen-receptor-positive, postmenopausal breast cancer patients: results of French Adjuvant Study Group 02 and 07 trials.","BACKGROUND: The purpose was to compare disease-free survival (DFS) between epirubicin-based chemoendocrine therapy and tamoxifen alone in one to three node-positive (N1-3), estrogen-receptor-positive (ER+), postmenopausal early breast cancer (EBC) patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed, retrospectively, 457 patients randomized in FASG 02 and 07 trials who received: tamoxifen alone (30 mg/day, 3 years); or FEC50 (fluorouracil 500 mg/m2, epirubicin 50 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2, six cycles every 21 days) plus tamoxifen started concurrently. Radiotherapy was delivered after the third cycle in FASG 02 trial, and after the sixth in FASG 07 trial. RESULTS: The 9-year DFS rates were 72% with tamoxifen and 84% with FEC50-tamoxifen (P = 0.008). The multivariate analysis showed that pathological tumor size >2 cm was an independent prognostic factor (P = 0.002), and treatment effects remained significantly in favor of chemoendocrine therapy (P = 0.0008). The 9-year overall survival rates were 78% and 86%, respectively (P = 0.11). In the multivariate model, there was a trend in favor of chemoendocrine therapy (P = 0.07). CONCLUSION: The addition of FEC50 adjuvant chemotherapy to tamoxifen significantly improves long-term DFS in N1-3, ER+ and postmenopausal women. Chemoendocrine therapy seems to be more effective than tamoxifen in terms of long-term survival.",0
Comparison of different approaches for assessment of HER2 expression on protein and mRNA level: prediction of chemotherapy response in the neoadjuvant GeparTrio trial (NCT00544765).,"Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) testing is an essential part of pathological assessment in breast cancer patients, as HER2 provides not only prognostic but also predictive information on response to targeted therapy. So far, HER2 test accuracy of immunohistochemistry/in situ-hybridization techniques is still under debate, and more reliable and robust technologies are needed. To address this issue and to evaluate the predictive value of HER2 on chemotherapy, we investigated a cohort of 278 patients from the GeparTrio trial, a prospective neoadjuvant anthracycline/taxane-based multicenter study. In the GeparTrio trial, patients were not treated with any anti-HER2 therapy, as this was not standard therapy at this time. The HER2 status was analyzed by three different approaches: local and central evaluation using immunohistochemistry combined with in situ-hybridization as well as evaluation of HER2 mRNA expression using kinetic RT-PCR from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples using a predefined cutoff. HER2 overexpression/amplification was observed in 37.3% (91/244) and 17.9% (41/229) of the informative samples in the local and central evaluations, respectively. Positive HER2 mRNA levels were found in 19.8% (55/278). We observed a highly significant correlation between central HER2 expression and HER2 status measured by kinetic RT-PCR (r = 0.856, P < 0.0001) and an overall agreement of 95.6% (κ statistic, 0.862, CI 0.77-0.94). Further, central HER2 as well as HER2 mRNA expression were predictors for a pathological complete response after neoadjuvant anthracycline/taxane-based primary chemotherapy in a univariate binary logistic regression analysis (OR 3.29, P = 0.002; OR 2.65, P = 0.004). The predictive value could be confirmed for the central HER2 status by multivariate analysis (OR 3.04, P = 0.027). The locally assessed HER2 status was not predictive of response to chemotherapy. Our results suggest that standardized methods are preferable for evaluation of HER2 status. The kinetic RT-PCR from FFPE tissue might be an additional approach for assessment of this important prognostic and predictive parameter but has to be confirmed by other studies.",0
"A phase I trial of topical topitriol (calcitriol, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) to prevent chemotherapy-induced alopecia.","This study evaluated the toxicity and efficacy of topical topitriol (calcitriol, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) to prevent chemotherapy-induced alopecia (CIA). Patients with breast cancer scheduled to receive FAC chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil, adriamycin and cyclophosphamide) were eligible for the study. Initially, the first six patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion to have received topitriol or placebo with all subsequent patients being treated with topitriol. Topitriol cream (0.0025 or 0.005%; 25 and 50 microg/g concentration) was administered topically twice a day. Three different doses and schedules of administration were evaluated including: 500 and 1000 microg daily for 7 days prior to chemotherapy, and 2000 microg daily for 5 days prior and 5 days post-chemotherapy. Fourteen patients were treated (12 with topitriol and two with placebo) at three different dose levels. All patients developed grade 2 alopecia between day 20 and 30 after chemotherapy, demonstrating the lack of efficacy of topical topitriol on this schedule of administration to prevent CIA. Eight patients exposed to topitriol developed a toxic maculopapular dermatitis in areas exposed to the drug. In conclusion, topical topitriol at the doses and schedules evaluated in this trial was ineffective to prevent CIA and induced a local dermatitis in areas exposed to the drug.",0
Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition does not improve the reduction in ductal carcinoma in situ proliferation with aromatase inhibitor therapy: results of the ERISAC randomized placebo-controlled trial.,"PURPOSE: Tamoxifen reduces risk of recurrence after breast conservation surgery for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), but no data exists on the effectiveness of aromatase inhibitors for DCIS. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is overexpressed in DCIS, representing another potential therapeutic target. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of aromatase and/or COX-2 inhibition on epithelial proliferation and apoptosis in a presurgical study of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive DCIS. Methods: Postmenopausal women with ER-positive DCIS diagnosed by core biopsy were randomized to a 2 x 2 design of either 14 days of exemestane or placebo and celecoxib, or placebo immediately before surgery. Paired baseline and end point biopsies were analyzed for proliferation (Ki67), apoptosis, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), COX-2, and progesterone receptor (PR) expression by immunohistochemistry. The primary end point was a decrease in Ki67 between diagnosis and surgical excision. RESULTS: Ninety women were randomized: all were ER positive, 49 (54%) had grade III tumors, and 29 (32%) were HER2 positive (3+). Exemestane reduced proliferation compared with placebo with a median reduction of 9% (95% confidence interval, 6-14; P < 0.001). Progesterone receptor was reduced by exemestane (mean decrease, 19%; 95% confidence interval, 9-28; P = 0.011). The effect of exemestane on proliferation was seen regardless of grade, HER2, or PR expression. Celecoxib had no effect on proliferation or apoptosis alone, or in combination with exemestane. CONCLUSIONS: Exemestane reduces proliferation in ER-positive DCIS. Aromatase inhibition is a potential alternative to tamoxifen in patients who have undergone breast conservation for ER-positive DCIS.",0
Celecoxib and exemestane versus placebo and exemestane in postmenopausal metastatic breast cancer patients: a double-blind phase III GINECO study.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate antitumor effects of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors in breast carcinoma and their ability to act synergistically with aromatase inhibitors (AIs). Postmenopausal metastatic breast cancer patients without previous adjuvant AI treatment received exemestane 25 mg/days plus either celecoxib 400 mg twice daily or placebo. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). This trial was prematurely terminated (N = 157 of 342 planned) after cardiovascular toxicity was reported in other celecoxib trials. Although no PFS difference was observed between the two arms (9.8 months for both, P = 0.72), a trend favoring celecoxib was observed in 60 tamoxifen-resistant patients (9.6 vs. 5.1 months; P = 0.14) and in 126 patients treated >or=3 months before study termination (12.2 vs. 9.8 months; P = 0.09). No severe adverse events were reported. Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors seemingly contribute to reverse endocrine resistance in breast cancer patients, although further study is necessary to allow development of a new therapeutic strategy.",1
Epirubicin and paclitaxel with G-CSF support in first line metastatic breast cancer: a randomized phase II study of dose-dense and dose-escalated chemotherapy.,"An increased dose-intensity can be achieved by either higher dose of chemotherapy per cycle (dose-escalation) or by shortening the interval between cycles (dose-dense). This multicenter randomized phase II study assessed the efficacy and safety of two different approaches: epirubicin 110 mg/m(2) combined with paclitaxel 200 mg/m(2) every 21 days and epirubicin 75 mg/m(2) combined with paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) every 10 days, both supported with G-CSF. Patients with advanced breast cancer and without prior palliative chemotherapy were scheduled for 6 cycles. Evaluable for response were 101 patients and for toxicity 106 patients. Grade ≥ 3 toxicities occurred in 39% of patients in the dose-escalated arm and in 29% of the dose-dense arm, mainly febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, neurotoxicity and (asymptomatic) cardiotoxicity. The median delivered cumulative doses for epirubicin/paclitaxel were 656/1194 and 448/1045 mg/m(2), treatment durations were 126 and 61 days, and delivered dose intensities were 36/67 and 51/120 mg/m(2)/week for the dose-escalated and dose-dense arm, respectively. Response rates were 75 and 70%, the progression-free survival 6 and 7 months, respectively. Dose-dense chemotherapy with a lower cumulative dose, a halved treatment time, but a higher dose-intensity may be as effective and safe as dose-escalated chemotherapy. The value of dose-densification over standard scheduled chemotherapy regimes yet needs to be determined.",1
Delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea is augmented by high levels of endogenous noradrenaline.,"The relation between pretreatment night-time urinary catecholamine excretion and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting was studied. The first cohort included 17 women and three men with various cancer forms receiving low or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. The second cohort included 42 women receiving cisplatinum (50 mg m-2) for ovarian cancer and ondansetron as an antiemetic (8 mg i.v. x 3 at chemotherapy and 8 mg p.o. x 3 for 5 days). Relatively higher noradrenaline, but not adrenaline, excretion was associated with an increased intensity of delayed nausea following treatment. Vomiting was not consistently related to the excretion of either catecholamine. The results indicate that noradrenaline modulates delayed nausea resulting from chemotherapy.",0
"Evaluation of GM-CSF mouthwash for prevention of chemotherapy-induced mucositis: a randomized, double-blind, dose-ranging study.","Uncontrolled clinical trials have shown that parenteral administration of GM-CSF reduces the frequency of chemotherapy-induced mucositis. The mechanism of this effect could be related to acceleration of haematopoiesis and/or increase in functional activation of WBC. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose ranging study of GM-CSF (mol-gramostim) mouthwash in patients with breast cancer during the first treatment cycle of a combination chemotherapy regimen which has historically produced dose-limiting (grade > or = 3) mucositis in approximately 39% of patients. Subjects were randomized to receive either placebo mouthwash (0.1 percent albumin) or one of four concentrations of GM-CSF mouthwash (0.01, 0.1, 1.0 or 10 mcg/ml). The primary endpoint was to evaluate the relationship between dose of GM-CSF mouthwash received and probability of grade > or = 3 mucositis using a logistic model. Solutions were administered four times daily starting within 24 hours of chemotherapy initiation and continuing until the end of the cycle (day 21). Mucositis was assessed on days 1-6, 10, 15 and 21. Day 6 plasma samples were assayed for GM-CSF. Forty-five patients were evaluable for response (nine per dosing group). A 42% risk (15/36) of mucositis grade > or = 3 was evident on day 15 in patients receiving GM-CSF compared to 2 of 9 patients on the placebo arm. No evidence of dose response was found by logistic regression. Five patients had a detectable plasma concentration of GM-CSF (56-209 pg/ml). A positive correlation between GM-CSF dose and leukocyte recovery was noted (P = 0.04).",0
Phase II study of weekly albumin-bound paclitaxel for patients with metastatic breast cancer heavily pretreated with taxanes.,"PURPOSE: Nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel, a solvent-free, albumin-bound paclitaxel, demonstrated antitumor activity in patients with taxane-naive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). We examined albumin-bound paclitaxel (100 mg/m2 or 125 mg/m2 administered weekly) to determine the antitumor activity in patients with MBC whose disease progressed despite conventional taxane therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women with MBC that was previously treated with taxanes were eligible for participation. Taxane failure was defined as metastatic disease progression during taxane therapy or relapse within 12 months of adjuvant taxane therapy. Primary objectives were response rates (RRs) and the safety/tolerability of albumin-bound paclitaxel. RESULTS: Women were treated with albumin-bound paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 (n = 106) or 125 mg/m2 (n = 75) on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. Response rates were 14% and 16% for the 100-mg/m2 and 125-mg/m2 cohorts, respectively; an additional 12% and 21% of patients, respectively, had stable disease (SD) > or = 16 weeks. Median progression-free survival times were 3 months at 100 mg/m2 and 3.5 months at 125 mg/m2; median survival times were 9.2 months and 9.1 months, respectively. Survival was similar for responding patients and those with SD. No severe hypersensitivity reactions were reported. Patients who developed treatment-limiting peripheral neuropathy typically could be restarted on a reduced dose of albumin-bound paclitaxel after a 1-2-week delay. Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in < 5% of patients. CONCLUSION: Albumin-bound paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 given weekly demonstrated the same antitumor activity as albumin-bound paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 weekly and a more favorable safety profile in patients with MBC that had progressed with previous taxane therapy. Survival of patients with SD > or = 16 weeks was similar to that of responders.",1
Establishment of histological criteria for high-risk node-negative breast carcinoma for a multi-institutional randomized clinical trial of adjuvant therapy. Japan National Surgical Adjuvant Study of Breast Cancer (NSAS-BC) Pathology Section.,"BACKGROUND: A multi-institutional randomized clinical trial of adjuvant therapy for patients with high-risk node-negative (n0) breast cancer has been undertaken in Japan. The pathology panel was organized in order to establish histological criteria to identify patient groups with higher rates of recurrence. METHODS: Initially, three pathologists independently judged the nuclear grade, composed of nuclear atypia and mitotic counts, of 100 n0 invasive ductal carcinomas, focusing on interobserver variation of the nuclear grade and its correlation with patient prognosis. These pathologists then gave consensus histological types and nuclear grades for 130 other n0 breast carcinomas and examined the prognostic significance of the grade. RESULTS: In the first study, nuclear grade 2-3 significantly identified a patient group with a rate of recurrence of 17-20% by any pathologists and the degree of agreement for the grade was fair. In the second study, the consensus type and nuclear grade identified a group (n = 66) with a 22% recurrence rate and another group (n = 64) with a 3.6% recurrence rate at 10 years. In 12 tumors, the resection-fixation interval of the tumor did not generate any significant difference in mitotic counts. CONCLUSIONS: The histological type and the nuclear grade clearly identified a higher-risk patient group with n0 breast carcinoma, and may be applied to the multi-institutional protocol study when the criteria have been well standardized by the pathologists.",0
Randomized Phase II Trial of weekly paclitaxel alone versus trastuzumab plus weekly paclitaxel as first-line therapy of patients with Her-2 positive advanced breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: A randomized Phase II study evaluated the activity of weekly paclitaxel versus its combination with trastuzumab for treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer overexpressing HER-2. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Among 124 patients randomized, 123 are assessable for toxicity and 118 for response. Patients received weekly paclitaxel single agent (80 mg/m2) or combined with trastuzumab (4 mg/kg loading dose, then weekly 2 mg/kg). HER-2 overexpression was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Patients with 2+/3+ IHC scores were eligible. IHC was compared with HER-2 serum extracellular domain (ECD). RESULTS: Patient characteristics were similar in the two arms. Both treatments were feasible and well tolerated with no grade 4 hematologic toxicity. No patient developed cardiac toxicity. The combined treatment was statistically significant superior for overall response rate (ORR) (75% vs. 56.9%; P = 0.037), particularly in the subset of IHC 3+ patients (84.5% vs. 47.5%; P = 0.00050). A statistically significant better median time to progression was seen in the subgroup with IHC 3+ (369 vs. 272 days; P = 0.030) and visceral disease (301 vs. 183 days; P = 0.0080) treated with combination. Multivariable analysis of predictive factors showed that only IHC score retained statistically significant value for ORR (P = 0.0035). CONCLUSION: Weekly paclitaxel plus trastuzumab is highly active and safe and it is superior to paclitaxel alone in patients with IHC score of 3+.",1
Electrochemotherapy with cisplatin of cutaneous tumor lesions in breast cancer.,"We have evaluated the efficiency of electrochemotherapy with cisplatin on cutaneous tumor lesions of breast cancer and have compared its efficiency with the efficiency of intratumoral (i.t.) administration of cisplatin alone. The study was performed on six breast cancer patients with 26 cutaneous lesions in whom all standard treatment modalities were exhausted. Of 26 lesions, 12 were treated by electrochemotherapy, six by i.t. cisplatin application, while eight were controls. In all 12 lesions treated by electrochemotherapy and followed-up for up to 26 weeks at the most, the objective response was obtained [complete response in 33% with mean duration of 10 weeks and partial response (PR) in 67% with a mean duration of 5 weeks]. In six lesions treated with i.t. application of cisplatin and followed-up for up to 12 weeks at the most, objective response was obtained in 83% of lesions; none of these responses were complete, the mean duration of PR was 5 weeks. During electrochemotherapy, only minimal local side-effects were observed, whereas no systemic side-effects of the treatment were noticed. We conclude that electrochemotherapy with i.t. cisplatin application is effective in local treatment of cutaneous tumor lesions of breast cancer.",0
Randomized trial of single dose versus fractionated palliative radiotherapy of bone metastases.,"PURPOSE: Data in the literature suggest that for painful bone metastases a single dose is as effective as fractionated radiotherapy. In the present multicentre prospective trial, the effects of 8 Gy x1 and 5 Gy x4 were compared. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 241 patients were randomized to 8 Gy (122 patients) or 20 Gy (119 patients). The primary tumour was in the breast in 39% of patients, in the prostate in 34% of patients, in the lung in 13% of patients and in other locations in 14% of patients. Outcome measures were pain relief as measured by VAS and in half of the patients also by a five-point categorical pain scale, global quality of life (QoL) and analgesic consumption. Evaluation was performed before and 4, 8, 12 and 20 weeks after treatment. RESULTS: A total of 239 patients were evaluable for response. The two groups did not differ with respect to age, sex, primary tumour, metastasis localization, analgesic consumption (type and dose), performance status, prior systemic treatment, degree of pain and QoL. The treatment was completed as planned in 98% of patients. The degree of pain relief did not differ between the two treatment groups. At 4 weeks the difference in pain relief was 6% (95% CI 7, 20%) and at 8 weeks the difference was 13% (95% CI 3, 28%). Neither was there any significant difference in the duration of pain relief, the number of new painful sites and the need for reirradiation and toxicity was minor. CONCLUSION: The present randomized study showed that a single fraction of 8 Gy was as effective as 5 Gy x4 in relieving pain from bone metastasis.",0
Efficacy of ibandronate for the treatment of skeletal events in patients with metastatic breast cancer.,"Patients with breast carcinoma often develop bone metastases that carry a high risk of complications. A randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ibandronate in patients with metastatic bone disease following breast cancer. The primary efficacy end point of the study was the proportion of patients who developed skeletal-related events (SREs, defined as pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, radiation therapy to bone, change in anti-neoplastic therapy and surgery to bone). Secondary end points included time to first skeletal event, skeletal morbidity rate (events/year) and time to progression of bone lesions. In 150 patients (148 [female symbol] / 2 [male symbol]) with breast carcinoma and bone metastases, treatment with intravenous ibandronate 6 mg over 15 min every 4 weeks for 24 months significantly reduced the proportion of patients who experienced an SRE compared with placebo (36% vs. 48%; P = 0.027). Time to first SRE was also delayed significantly (median 457 vs. 304 days; P = 0.007). Multiple event analysis showed that ibandronate reduced the risk of developing an SRE by 32% (hazard ratio = 0.69; 95% confidence interval 0.42-0.79; P = 0.003). In general, ibandronate was well tolerated with very rare grade 3 or 4 toxicity. In this study, ibandronate was shown to be significantly more effective than placebo as a treatment for metastatic bone disease from breast cancer using multiple end points.",0
"Relationship between bone mass, invasive breast cancer incidence and raloxifene therapy in postmenopausal women with low bone mass or osteoporosis.","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between bone mass and risk of breast cancer and to determine the effect of raloxifene therapy on breast cancer incidence in women categorized by bone mass into low bone mass and osteoporosis subgroups. DESIGN: In this post hoc analysis, data were analyzed from the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation (MORE) trial, enrolling postmenopausal women with low bone mass (N = 7705), and the Continuing Outcomes Relevant to Evista (CORE) trial, a follow-up to MORE enrolling 4011 MORE participants. Total follow-up was for up to 8 years. Women with a total hip bone mineral density (BMD) T-score < -1 to > -2.5 or T-score < or = -2.5 (referent, NHANES III database) were classified as having low bone mass or osteoporosis, respectively. Women with a pre-existing vertebral fracture were considered as having osteoporosis irrespective of BMD T-score. Analyses were performed for invasive breast cancers and invasive estrogen-receptor (ER) positive breast cancers. RESULTS: Women with low bone mass (N = 3829) had a twofold higher incidence of invasive ER-positive breast cancer than those with osteoporosis (N = 3836) (HR 2.13, 95% CI 1.12-4.03). The incidence of all invasive breast cancers did not differ significantly between the bone mass groups. The incidences of invasive and invasive ER-positive breast cancers were 65-78% lower in women assigned raloxifene versus placebo in both the low bone mass and osteoporosis groups (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In this post hoc analysis of postmenopausal women participating in MORE and CORE, bone mass was a predictor of invasive ER-positive breast cancer. Raloxifene treatment reduced the risk of invasive and invasive ER-positive breast cancers in women with low bone mass and those with osteoporosis. Since participants were older postmenopausal women with low bone mass, whether these findings can be generalized to other postmenopausal women is unclear.",0
Predictors of central nervous system metastasis in patients with metastatic breast cancer. A competing risk analysis of 579 patients treated with epirubicin-based chemotherapy.,"In order to identify factors predictive of central nervous system (CNS) metastasis, we reviewed the histories of 579 patients treated with epirubicin-based chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer. Statistical analysis included Kaplan-Meier survival plots, Cox's regression analysis and competing risk analysis using the cumulative incidence. Median follow-up-time was 137 months (range 0-183+). In this period, one hundred and twenty-four patients (21.4%) developed CNS metastasis. Lung, liver, and lymph node metastases and oestrogen receptor negative or unknown tumor were predictive as well. However, increased pretreatment lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentration in serum above the upper normal limits was the strongest single risk factor and should therefore be measured. The risk of CNS metastasis differed considerably among risk groups. Patients without risk factors had a cumulative incidence on 9%, compared to a cumulative incidence of 42%, when the serum LDH concentration was elevated to more than twice the upper normal limits.",0
"Randomized clinical trial comparing mitoxantrone with epirubicin and with doxorubicin, each combined with cyclophosphamide in the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer.","Two hundred and twenty-four patients with advanced breast cancer were enrolled in a multicenter prospective randomized clinical study and received either doxorubicin (40 mg/m2), or epirubicin (40 mg/m2) or mitoxantrone (12 mg/m2) each combined with cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2) i.v. In the patient collective the following response rates were observed: complete response 12.1%; partial response 30.6%; stable disease 40.5%; progressive disease 16.8%. A complete response was observed significantly less often in patients where more than one organ site was involved as compared to those patients with only one metastatic site. The mean time period required to reach a best response was 3.7 months. There was no significant difference between the response rates in the three arms. In comparing the observed toxicities in 1,434 treatment cycles, there was a significant difference with regard to leukocytopenia (mitoxantrone arm exhibiting more than either epirubicin and doxorubicin) although infections did not occur more frequently in the mitoxantrone arm; with regard to alopecia, mitoxantrone and epirubicin arms both exhibited less than doxorubicin. It is noteworthy that no patient who had previously received adjuvant chemotherapy achieved a complete response (p = 0.006). The overall significance of these findings can only be clearly evaluated when survival times can be measured.",1
A phase III study of high-dose intensification without hematopoietic progenitor cells support for patients with high-risk primary breast carcinoma.,"Patients with more than nine ipsilateral lymph node involvement or inflammatory breast cancer have a 5-year survival rate of approximately 50%. We studied the efficacy of high-dose intensification, comparing it with the standard dose chemotherapy for patients with high-risk primary breast cancer. Patients with inflammatory breast cancer or more than nine ipsilateral lymph node involvement without evidence of distant metastasis were randomized to receive either standard dose 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) every 3 weeks for nine courses (control) or six courses of FAC followed by two courses of cyclophosphamide (5.25 g/m2), etoposide (1,500 mg/m2), and cisplatin (165 mg/m2) (HDCVP). The study was terminated in 1998 because of slow accrual of patients. Forty-six patients were entered in the study. At 4 years, the overall survival was 72.8% (SE 11.9%) and 61.7% (SE 12.4%), and disease-free survival were 45.5% (SE 12.3%) and 33.7% (SE 11.9%) for the control and HDCVP groups, respectively (p = 0.757 and 0.720). With the small number of patients in our study, a small overall survival benefit of high-dose intensification compared with the standard therapy cannot be excluded. However, any substantial benefit is unlikely.",1
"Randomised trial: One cycle of anthracycline-containing adjuvant chemotherapy compared with six cycles of CMF treatment in node-positive, hormone receptor-negative breast cancer patients.","AIM: A randomised, controlled clinical trial was initiated in 1984 to test whether 1 cycle of anthracycline-containing adjuvant chemotherapy improves the outcome of breast cancer patients presenting with stage II disease and negative oestrogen and progesterone receptors (ER, PgR), as compared with 6 cycles of dose-reduced CMF. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Within 7 years 263 women with stage II breast cancer were randomised either to receive 1 cycle of doxorubicin, vinblastine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5- fluorouracil (AV-CMF) or to receive 6 cycles of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF). Patients were stratified for tumour stage, nodal stage, menopausal status, type of surgery and participating centre. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 100 months, neither disease-free (DFS) nor overall survival (OS) differed significantly between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to 6 cycles of a non-standard low-dose CMF regimen 1 cycle of anthracycline- containing adjuvant chemotherapy failed to improve the outcome in women with stage II receptor-negative breast cancer in terms of DFS and OS.",1
Surgical procedures after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in operable breast cancer: results of the GEPARDUO trial.,"BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy can increase the rate of breast-conserving surgery in patients with operable breast cancer. However, uncertainty remains regarding surgical procedures and predictors for successful breast-conserving surgery. METHODS: This study was an analysis of surgical data of a representative data subset of 607 patients enrolled in the GEPARDUO study. This prospective, multicenter, phase III study randomly assigned patients with operable breast cancer (> or = 2 cm) to neoadjuvant 8-week dose-dense doxorubicin plus docetaxel or a 24-week schedule of doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel (AC-DOC). RESULTS: Breast conservation was attempted in 493 (81.2%) patients, but 43 patients eventually required mastectomy, thus resulting in a breast-conserving surgery rate of 74.1%. Breast-conserving re-excision was performed in 61 patients (12.4%). Factors associated with a significantly higher breast-conserving surgery rate were a prechemotherapy tumor size < or = 40 mm, nonlobular histological characteristics, treatment with AC-DOC, clinical response, postchemotherapy tumor size < or = 20 mm, and treatment in a larger center (>10 enrolled patients). Nonlobular histological characteristics and intraoperative frozen-section analysis for margin evaluation were associated with significantly lower reoperation rates (P = .015). CONCLUSIONS: Breast conservation after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is feasible in most patients with operable breast cancer. For surgical planning, tumor characteristics and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be taken into account. Improved breast-imaging modalities are necessary to improve detection of residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, especially when breast cancer is of lobular invasive histology. Margin assessment by intraoperative frozen-section analysis is helpful to avoid reoperation. To achieve an optimal result, an interdisciplinary surgical approach is important.",0
"Is salvage chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer always effective and well tolerated? A phase II randomized trial of vinorelbine versus 5-fluorouracil plus leucovorin versus combination of mitoxantrone, 5-fluorouracil plus leucovorin.","Metastatic breast cancer remains an incurable disease and the median overall survival has not significantly improved over the past two decades. Aims of the present randomized phase II trial were to analyse activity and toxicity of chemotherapies with single agent or with combination regimens in previously treated patients with advanced breast cancer. Ninety-nine eligible patients were randomized to receive the following chemotherapies: Arm A - vinorelbine 30 mg/m2 i.v. weekly; Arm B - leucovorin 100 mg/m2 i.v. followed by 5-fluorouracil 370 mg/m2 i.v. days 1 --> 5, q 28 days; Arm C - mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2 i.v. only day 1 + leucovorin 100 mg/m2 i.v. followed by 5-fluorouracil 370 mg/m2 i.v. days 1 --> 3, q 28 days. Patients characteristics are comparable in the three groups. The median number of chemotherapy courses administered was 7, 6 and 5 in arm A, B and C, respectively. Objective responses were 24%, 30% and 21% and the median duration of responses were 2, 2.5 and 5.5 months in the arm A, B and C, respectively. Median overall survivals were 9.5, 9 and 9 months in the three arms. No difference was noted comparing the survivals of responding or non responding patients. General toxicity was not mild, with 27.5% of patients experiencing WHO grade 3-4 toxicities. Our results are similar in the three groups of patients and comparable to those reported by other authors. Chemotherapy applied to patients with second or subsequent recurrence allow objective responses in a small percentage of patients. Moreover responders have a negligible prolongation of survival.",1
XM02 is superior to placebo and equivalent to Neupogen in reducing the duration of severe neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in cycle 1 in breast cancer patients receiving docetaxel/doxorubicin chemotherapy.,"BACKGROUND: Recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs) such as Filgrastim are used to treat chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. We investigated a new G-CSF, XM02, and compared it to Neupogen after myelotoxic chemotherapy in breast cancer (BC) patients. METHODS: A total of 348 patients with BC receiving docetaxel/doxorubicin chemotherapy were randomised to treatment with daily injections (subcutaneous 5 microg/kg/day) for at least 5 days and a maximum of 14 days in each cycle of XM02 (n = 140), Neupogen (n = 136) or placebo (n = 72). The primary endpoint was the duration of severe neutropenia (DSN) in cycle 1. RESULTS: The mean DSN in cycle 1 was 1.1, 1.1, and 3.9 days in the XM02, Neupogen, and placebo group, respectively. Superiority of XM02 over placebo and equivalence of XM02 with Neupogen could be demonstrated. Toxicities were similar between XM02 and Neupogen. CONCLUSION: XM02 was superior to placebo and equivalent to Neupogen in reducing DSN after myelotoxic chemotherapy.",0
Phase I/II pharmacokinetic study of pemetrexed and epirubicin in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Pemetrexed and epirubicin are each active in patients with advanced/metastatic breast cancer (MBC). This phase I/II study evaluated these drugs as a combination regimen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women with locally advanced or MBC were enrolled. Pemetrexed 400-600 mg/m2 and epirubicin 60-90 mg/m2 were administered on day 1 every 21 days. The recommended phase II dose was evaluated in a 2-stage design. RESULTS: Phase I enrolled 34 patients and evaluated 5 dose levels. Dose-limiting toxicities were neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. Patients received a median of 7.5 cycles (range, 1-8 cycles), and promising efficacy (partial response [PR], 32%; stable disease [SD], 50%) was observed. Pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed was unchanged when combined with epirubicin. Selected phase II regimen (pemetrexed 600 mg/m2 and epirubicin 75 mg/m2) was administered to 22 patients (median, 4.5 cycles; range 1-13 cycles). Five patients experienced a PR (23%), and 10 experienced SD (46%). This response was below the predefined efficacy requirements for subsequent enrollment, and accrual was stopped. Median time to progression was 5.3 months (95% CI, 3.1-8.9 months), and median time to treatment failure was 3.5 months (95% CI, 2.6-5.9 months). CONCLUSION: The regimen is safe but cannot be recommended as first-line chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer because of the low response rate.",1
Paclitaxel and epirubicin as first-line therapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer.,"Paclitaxel (Taxol), has aroused considerable interest for its high single-agent activity in breast cancer and novel mechanism of action. Epirubicin (Farmorubicin), the 4'epimer of doxorubicin (Adriamycin), also has high activity in breast cancer, with the advantage of a lower rate of toxic side effects-especially cardiac effects-compared with its parent compound. The combination of paclitaxel and doxorubicin has yielded response rates between 63% and 94% in phase I/II studies, but authors reported severe cardiac toxic events. The goal for the current study was to evaluate the combination of paclitaxel and epirubicin, focusing mainly on cardiac toxicity. Of a total of 85 patients entered, 68 patients with metastatic breast cancer were evaluable. Nearly 20% had primary metastatic breast cancer with large tumors. Half had received adjuvant chemotherapy. Study medication in Group A consisted of 60 mg/m2 epirubicin given over 1 hour, followed by paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 as a 3-hour IV infusion. In Group B, 90 mg/m2 epirubicin was combined with 175 mg/m2 paclitaxel, delivered as for Group A. The main toxicity in both groups was neutropenia. In Group A, the paclitaxel dose could be escalated to 200 mg/m2 in 15 patients and to 225 mg/m2 in 7 patients; dose reduction due to severe neutropenia was necessary in 11 patients. No cardiac adverse events were reported in Group A. In Group B, only one patient could be escalated to 200 mg/m2 but three patients required a dose reduction. In this group, one patient had a decrease of left ventricular ejection fraction of more than 10% without any clinical signs. Of 43 patients in Group A and 25 in Group B, the response rate was 67% in Group A and 68% in Group B. The duration of response was 8.2 months in both groups. The combination of paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 and epirubicin 60 mg/m2 or 90 mg/m2 can be safely administered. The response data were encouraging and further evaluation is warranted.",1
Accuracy of the combination of mammography and sonography in predicting tumor response in breast cancer patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.,"BACKGROUND: Residual tumor size after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is an important consideration in surgical planning. We examined the accuracy of the combination of mammography and sonography in predicting pathologic residual tumor size. METHODS: Tumor size was evaluated by physical examination, mammography, and sonography at diagnosis and before surgery in 162 breast cancer patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Agreement between the predicted and the pathologic responses and the predicted and the pathologic tumor sizes was calculated. The effect of invasive lobular carcinoma, high nuclear grade, hormone receptor positivity, and the presence of an extensive intraductal component on the accuracy of mammography and sonography in predicting pathologic residual tumor size was analyzed. RESULTS: Forty-two patients (25.9%) had a pathologic complete response (pCR). Overall agreement between predicted and pathologic responses was 53% for physical examination, 67% for mammography plus sonography, and 63% for physical examination plus mammography and sonography. The sensitivity of mammography and sonography in predicting pCR was 78.6%, and the specificity was 92.5%; the accuracy was 88.9%. Residual tumor size determined by mammography and sonography correlated with pathologic residual tumor size (r = .662); pathologic tumor size was within .5 cm of predicted in 69.1% of patients. Multivariate analysis showed that pathologic residual tumor size was underestimated for lobular carcinoma and overestimated for poorly differentiated tumors. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of mammography and sonography has a high accuracy in predicting pCR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Agreement of residual tumor size in mammography and sonography with pathologic residual tumor size was moderate.",0
"Impact of complementary mistletoe extract treatment on quality of life in breast, ovarian and non-small cell lung cancer patients. A prospective randomized controlled clinical trial.","Standardized aqueous mistletoe extracts have been applied to cancer patients for several decades as complementary medicine. A multicentric, randomized, open, prospective clinical trial was conducted in three oncological centers in the People's Republic of China in Bejing, Shenyang and Tianjin. Following the guidelines of ""Good Clinical Practice"" (GCP) this study was performed to get information on efficacy safety and side-effects of the standardized mistletoe extract (sME). Two hundred and thirty-three patients with breast (n=68), ovarian (n=71) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; n=94) were enrolled into this study. Two hundred and twenty-four patients fulfilled the requirements for final analysis (n=115 treated with sME HELIXOR A; n=109 comprising the control group being treated with the approved immunomodulating phytopharmacon Lentinan). All patients were provided with standard tumor-destructive treatment schedules and complementarily treated with sME or Lentinan during chemotherapy according to treatment protocol. Biometrically, the patients of the control and sME treatment group were comparable regarding distribution, clinical classification (WHO) and treatment protocols. Analysis was performed according to the ""Intention to treat principle"". Quality of life (QoL) was significantly (p<0.05) improved for patients who were complementarily treated with sME, as determined by the questionnaires FLIC (Functional Living Index-Cancer), TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine Index) and the KPI (Karnofsky Performance Index) in comparison to the control group. Additionally, the occurrence of adverse events (AEs) was less frequent in the sME than in the control group (total number of AEs 52 versus 90 and number of serious AEs 5 versus 10 in study and control group, most of them due to chemotherapy). Only one serious AE was allocated to complementary treatment in each group (1 angioedema in sME group). All other side-effects of the sME (7 harmless local inflammatory reactions at subcutaneous injection site, 4 cases with fever) were self-limiting and did not demand therapeutic intervention. This study showed that complementary treatment with sME can beneficially reduce the side-effects of chemotherapy in cancer patients and thus improve quality of life.",0
Phase I-II clinical trial with alpha-difluoromethylornithine--an inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis.,"Alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) is an enzyme-activated, irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, the first enzyme in the synthesis of the polyamines putrescine, spermidine and spermine. DFMO has been shown to have a cytostatic and cytotoxic effect against various human tumor cell lines. The present study was designed to evaluate the toxicity and efficacy of this compound when administered orally at a dose of 1.7 g/m sq. t.i.d. added to conventional chemotherapy to 38 patients with carcinoma of the breast, stomach, prostate, female genital organs or metastatic carcinoma of unknown origin. A control group of 32 patients with similar malignancies received conventional chemotherapy only. Gastrointestinal, hematologic and biochemical abnormalities caused by DFMO were negligible. Reasonable ototoxicity was the major toxic effect caused by DFMO and resulted in discontinuation of therapy in 6 of 38 patients (15.8%). No differences in disease progression were seen between those patients receiving DFMO plus conventional chemotherapy and those receiving only conventional chemotherapy.",0
The effect of different doses of cyclosporin A on the systemic exposure of orally administered paclitaxel.,"The objective of this study was to define the minimally effective dose of cyclosporin A (CsA) that would result in a maximal increase of the systemic exposure to oral paclitaxel. Six evaluable patients participated in this randomized cross-over study in which they received at two occasions two doses of 90 mg/m(2) oral paclitaxel 7 h apart in combination with 10 or 5 mg/kg CsA. Dose reduction of CsA from 10 to 5 mg/kg resulted in a statistically significant decrease in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and time above the threshold concentrations of 0.1 microM (T>0.1 microM) of oral paclitaxel. The mean (+/-SD) AUC and T>0.1 microM values of oral paclitaxel with CsA 10 mg/kg were 4.29+/-0.88 microM x h and 12.0+/-2.1 h, respectively. With CsA 5 mg/kg these values were 2.75+/-0.63 microM x h and 7.0+/-2.1 h, respectively (p=0.028 for both parameters). In conclusion, dose reduction of CsA from 10 to 5 mg/kg resulted in a significant decrease in the AUC and T>0.1 microM values of oral paclitaxel. Because CsA 10 mg/kg resulted in similar paclitaxel AUC and T>0.1 microM values compared to CsA 15 mg/kg (data which we have published previously), the minimally effective dose of CsA is determined at 10 mg/kg.",1
A clinical trial of mitoxantrone (novantrone) versus doxorubicin (adriamycin) in combination chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer.,"Mitoxantrone (Novantrone, N) is a new anthracenedione derivative with structural similarities to doxorubicin (Adriamycin, A). It has shown significant activity during phase I and II clinical trials in the treatment of advanced breast cancer. The present trial compares the CNF regimen to CAF. All patients received cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) and 5-fluorouracil (500 mg/m2), with either N (10 mg/m2) or A (50-60 mg), repeated every three weeks. There were 30 patients in the mitoxantrone group and 30 patients in the doxorubicin group. The results presented are based on 60 patients: 70% were postmenopausal; 25% had received adjuvant chemotherapy; 29% had prior hormonal therapy in an adjuvant setting or for relapse. There were no significant differences between the pretreatment characteristics of each group. The response rate (complete + partial) for CNF was 57% and for CAF was 40%. The dose limiting toxicity was granulocytopenia seen after the 3rd cycle in the CNF group. Thrombocytopenia was not seen. There was less nausea and vomiting in the CNF group. No cardiotoxicity was seen in CNF; only 2 patients suffered from congestive heart failure in CAF. These preliminary data indicate that CNF seems to be an effective regimen for patients with advanced breast cancer and has fewer adverse effects than CAF.",1
"Mitoxantrone, fluorouracil, and L-folinic acid in anthracycline-pretreated metastatic breast cancer patients.","In this phase II trial we have evaluated the activity and toxicity of a combination regimen containing mitoxantrone, L-leucovorin, and fluorouracil in patients with advanced breast cancer pretreated with anthracyclines. Forty-six patients were included into the study; they received a total of 227 cycles of chemotherapy. Median age was 63 years (range 34-78), median performance status was 80 (range 60-100). Visceral metastases were present in 37 patients, 6 patients had bone involvement only, while 3 patients had soft tissue/lymph node disease. Median number of previous chemotherapy regimens for advanced disease was 2 (range 1-3). Ten patients had anthracycline primary resistance (progressive disease during treatment). Twenty-three patients received mitoxantrone 12 mg/sqm day 1; fluorouracil 370 mg/sqm and L-folinic acid 100 mg/sqm days 1-3 administered every three weeks. Another group of 23 patients were treated with the same regimen using a prolonged 5FU/L-FA schedule (5 days). Two complete responses and 6 partial responses were recorded with the 3-day schedule; 7 partial responses in the 5-day schedule (overall response rate 32.6%, 95% C.I. 19-46%). Two partial responses were observed in patients with anthracycline primary resistance. Median response duration was 9 months (range 3-16). Hematologic toxicity was mild: grade 3-4 leukopenia was recorded in 5 patients, grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia in 3 patients. Grade III-IV stomatitis and diarrhea was recorded in 4 and 5 patients respectively (all receiving the 5-day 5-FU/L-FA schedule). Cardiac toxicity was observed in two cases. This regimen proved active in advanced breast cancer following anthracycline-containing chemotherapy, and the 3-day schedule could be offered to such patients with acceptable toxicity.",1
Incidence of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women after discontinuation of long-term raloxifene administration.,"BACKGROUND: Postmenopausal women with osteoporosis had a 66% relative risk reduction for invasive breast cancer over 8 years of raloxifene therapy in the randomized, placebo-controlled 4-year MORE (Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation) trial and the CORE (Continuing Outcomes Relevant to Evista) trial, a 4-year follow-up to MORE. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The first post hoc analysis examined the effects of raloxifene on the cumulative incidence of invasive breast cancer on a yearly basis. Another analysis compared the incidence of invasive breast cancer in 3967 patients who continued raloxifene for 8 years (RLX-C, n = 2280), discontinued raloxifene after 4 years in MORE (RLX-D, n = 401), or took placebo (n = 1286) for a mean 2.9 years' treatment duration (57,338 patient-years). RESULTS: The unadjusted breast cancer incidence rate was 5.39 per 1000 patient-years in the placebo group compared with 2.26 in the RLX-C group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.41 [95% CI 0.21-0.81]) and 3.59 in the RLX-D group (HR, 0.69 [95% CI 0.23-2.01]). Because the choice of taking the study drug was not randomized in CORE, propensity scores were used to adjust for potential imbalances in baseline characteristics before CORE. Results after adjustment by the propensity score method were similar to the unadjusted results. CONCLUSION: This analysis suggests a persistent effect for breast cancer risk reduction in patients who discontinued raloxifene, although this conclusion is limited by the small sample size.",0
Surgery following neoadjuvant therapy in patients with HER2-positive locally advanced or inflammatory breast cancer participating in the NeOAdjuvant Herceptin (NOAH) study.,"AIM: To describe surgical outcomes in patients with HER2-positive locally advanced (LABC) or inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) participating in the NeOAdjuvant Herceptin (NOAH) study (ISRCTN86043495). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 235 patients with HER2-positive disease were randomized to neoadjuvant trastuzumab plus chemotherapy (doxorubicin plus paclitaxel, followed by paclitaxel, followed by cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and fluorouracil) or neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone. Of these patients, 228 received their allocated treatment (115 received trastuzumab plus chemotherapy and 113 received chemotherapy alone) and were potentially eligible for surgery. Mastectomy was required for all patients with IBC and was recommended for all patients with LABC. However, breast-conserving therapy could be considered for patients with peripheral neoplasms measuring ≤ 4 cm in diameter at diagnosis, with a favorable ratio of tumor to breast volume, or at the patient's request if there had been a good response to treatment. RESULTS: As previously reported, the addition of trastuzumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy improved the overall, complete and pathological complete response to therapy and significantly improved event-free survival (the primary endpoint of the study). Trastuzumab also enabled more patients to have breast conserving surgery (BCS) (23% versus 13% respectively) without an apparent detrimental effect on local disease control (no patient treated with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy had experienced a local recurrence after BCS at the time of analysis). CONCLUSIONS: Although this was not an aim of the trial, neoadjuvant trastuzumab given concurrently with chemotherapy enabled 23% of patients with HER2-positive LABC/IBC to avoid mastectomy (including a small number of patients with IBC).",0
"Long-term effects of fenretinide, a retinoic acid derivative, on the insulin-like growth factor system in women with early breast cancer.","High insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in premenopausal women. Because the synthetic retinoid fenretinide showed a beneficial effect on second breast cancers in premenopausal women in a Phase III trial, we studied its long-term effects on IGF-I levels. We measured, at yearly intervals for up to 5 years, the circulating levels of IGF-I, IGF binding protein (BP)-3, and their molar ratio in 60 subjects < or = 50 years of age and 60 subjects > 50 years of age allocated either to fenretinide or no treatment. In women < or = 50 years of age, measurements of IGF-II, IGFBP-1, and IGFBP-2 were also performed. The associations between biomarkers and drug or metabolite plasma concentrations were also investigated. All biomarkers were relatively stable over 5 years in the control group. Compared with controls and after adjustment for baseline, treatment with fenretinide for 1 year induced the following changes: IGF-I, -13% [95% confidence interval (CI), -25 to 1%] in women < or = 50 years of age and -3% (95% CI, -16 to 13%) in women > 50 years of age; IGFBP-3, -4% (95% CI, -12 to 6%) in both age groups; IGF-I:IGFBP-3 molar ratio, -11% (95% CI, -22 to 1%) in women < or = 50 years of age and 1% (95% CI, -11 to 16%) in women > 50 years of age. These effects were apparently maintained for up to 5 years, although fewer samples were available as time progressed. No change in other IGF components was observed. Drug and metabolite concentrations were negatively correlated with IGF-I and IGF-I:IGFBP-3 molar ratio in women < or = 50 years of age. Fenretinide induces a moderate decline of IGF-I levels in women < or = 50 years of age. The association between IGF-I change and the reduction of second breast cancers in premenopausal women warrants further study.",0
Evaluation of a cooperative clinical study of the cytostatic agent ifosfamide.,"In cooperative studies performed in 21 German clinics, the new cytostatic agent 3-(2-chloroethyl)-2-[(2-chloroethyl)-amino]-tetrahydro-2H-1,3,2-oxazaphosphorine-2-oxide (ifosfamide; trade name: Holoxan) was administered as massive-dose treatment. The studies aimed at confirming the results obtained in pharmacological and Phase I clinical trials with a fractionated administration of ifosfamide on a large scale. The study was carried out in 390 patients suffering from various malignant conditions. The majority of patients had had pretreatment without response or were admitted at an advanced stage of disease. Despite this negative selection, 25.5% of the patients showed an initial full remission and 42.3% partial remission; in 32.2% of the patients, reduction of the tumour signs by at least 50% was not attained. After an average observation period of 6 1/2 months, 53.8% of the patients were still alive. The study clearly shows the superiority of fractionated administration of ifosfamide when compared to its use as a single administration. In addition, the rates of remission and survival, and of survival times, were clearly dependent on dosage, independent of the tumour type. A daily dosage of 50 to 60 mg/kg ifosfamide on 5 consecutive days produced the best results. In spite of the fact that ifosfamide was not always given at optimum dosage, it proved to be definitely superior to conventional chemotherapy in testicular tumours, particularly teratomas and also in hypernephromas. Retrospective comparison with results of conventional chemotherapy for ovarian, bronchial and mammary cancer has shown ifosfamide to produce the same therapeutic effect in these tumour types. In this study group, leukopenia was not regarded as a limiting factor to the administration of ifosfamide. Side effects in the efferent urinary tract, particularly cystitis, were controlled with adequate preventive measures.",1
"Local relapse in primary breast cancer patients with unexcised positive surgical margins after lumpectomy, radiotherapy and chemoendocrine therapy.","BACKGROUND: Inadequate surgical excision with residual involvement of resection margins by tumour after breast conservation results in increased local recurrence rates. To reduce this risk positive margins are, therefore, usually excised. Systemic treatment with tamoxifen or chemotherapy reduces local recurrence, along with radiotherapy. However, no studies to date have examined the correlation between chemoendocrine treatment, together with radiotherapy, and local relapse in patients with unexcised involved resection margins, having had breast conservation treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The histopathology reports were reviewed of 184 patients who were treated from June 1991 to August 1995 within our randomised study of neoadjuvant versus adjuvant chemoendocrine therapy with mitozantrone and methotrexate (2M) +/- mitomycin-C (3M) and tamoxifen, used concurrently with radiation following conservation surgical treatment. Histological resection margin was considered positive if ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive carcinoma was present microscopically less than 1 mm from the excision margin. RESULTS: Although 38% of patients had unexcised microscopically involved margins, local relapse rate as first site of relapse was only 1.9% after a median follow up of 57 months. There was no difference in distant relapse (P = 0.2) and survival (P = 0.5) between the positive and negative margins groups. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of positive unexcised margins does not have a significant effect on outcome in patients who are treated with chemoendocrine therapy together with radiotherapy. Further clinical trials are required.",0
"Evaluation of a 30-gene paclitaxel, fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy response predictor in a multicenter randomized trial in breast cancer.","PURPOSE: We examined in a prospective, randomized, international clinical trial the performance of a previously defined 30-gene predictor (DLDA-30) of pathologic complete response (pCR) to preoperative weekly paclitaxel and fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (T/FAC) chemotherapy, and assessed if DLDA-30 also predicts increased sensitivity to FAC-only chemotherapy. We compared the pCR rates after T/FAC versus FACx6 preoperative chemotherapy. We also did an exploratory analysis to identify novel candidate genes that differentially predict response in the two treatment arms.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Two hundred and seventy-three patients were randomly assigned to receive either weekly paclitaxel × 12 followed by FAC × 4 (T/FAC, n = 138), or FAC × 6 (n = 135) neoadjuvant chemotherapy. All patients underwent a pretreatment fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the tumor for gene expression profiling and treatment response prediction.RESULTS: The pCR rates were 19% and 9% in the T/FAC and FAC arms, respectively (P < 0.05). In the T/FAC arm, the positive predictive value (PPV) of the genomic predictor was 38% [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 21-56%], the negative predictive value was 88% (95% CI, 77-95%), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.711. In the FAC arm, the PPV was 9% (95% CI, 1-29%) and the AUC was 0.584. This suggests that the genomic predictor may have regimen specificity. Its performance was similar to a clinical variable-based predictor nomogram.CONCLUSIONS: Gene expression profiling for prospective response prediction was feasible in this international trial. The 30-gene predictor can identify patients with greater than average sensitivity to T/FAC chemotherapy. However, it captured molecular equivalents of clinical phenotype. Next-generation predictive markers will need to be developed separately for different molecular subsets of breast cancers.",0

Comparison of in situ methods to assess DNA cleavage in apoptotic cells in patients with breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Apoptosis has a role in many cellular processes including development, normal tissue homeostasis, and malignancy. This aspect of research is relatively new with distinct methods of analysing disparate biochemical and genetic events to measure apoptotic cells. The use of biotinylated nucleotides to identify DNA strand breaks is a commonly reported method of estimating cells numbers undergoing apoptosis; however, investigators report inconsistent results for a variety of reasons. AIMS AND METHOD: To compare two in situ techniques of measuring apoptosis: in situ nick translation (ISNT) and TdT mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labelling (TUNEL); and to assess DNA cleavage in 20 paired paraffin wax embedded breast cancer tissues from patients; one group who had received no prior treatment and one group who had received chemohormonal treatment. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Apoptotic scores obtained from paraffin wax embedded human breast cancer after using ISNT and TUNEL methods were not significantly different (p = 0.11). A strong correlation between scores obtained from the two techniques was found (r = 0.758, p < 0.0001). Optimisation of both techniques is crucial to ensure maximal assay performance in breast cancer tissue.",0
Randomised phase II study of epirubicin-vindesine versus mitoxantrone-vindesine in metastatic breast cancer.,"The purpose of this study was to compare the activity and toxicity of epirubicin-vindesine (EV) with mitoxantrone-vindesine (MV) in patients with metastatic breast cancer. A total of 295 patients was randomly allocated to treatment with vindesine 3 mg/m2 combined with either epirubicin 40 mg/m2 or mitoxantrone 10 mg/m2. All drugs were given by intravenous push, treatment cycles were repeated at 3-4 week intervals. 255 patients were available for response, and 283 for toxicity. EV and MV yielded similar objective response rates (34 and 26%, respectively), response durations, times to progression and survival. Median time to remission was 1.8 and 3.1 months (P = 0.006) with EV and MV, respectively. In patients with visceral metastases, response rate was higher with EV than MV (40 versus 23%; P = 0.03). Patients receiving MV had less nausea/vomiting (P = 0.007) and alopecia (P = < 0.001) of WHO grade > or = 2. Bone marrow, cardiac and other toxicities were mild with both treatments. The observed differences in activity and toxicity between the two regimens appear to have clinical relevance. EV proved to be more active in visceral disease and to be able to induce remissions more rapidly. Accordingly, patients with visceral metastases or severe tumour-related symptoms may benefit from epirubicin-based treatment. Subjective toxicities, i.e. nausea/vomiting and alopecia, were less frequent and severe with MV. Thus, MV may prove useful in patients with more indolent disease and appears to warrant phase III evaluation in such patients.",1
"Front-line chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide for patients with brain metastases from breast carcinoma, nonsmall cell lung carcinoma, or malignant melanoma: a prospective study.","BACKGROUND: The conventional treatment of brain metastases not amenable to surgery is most often radiotherapy. Until now, pharmacologic issues related to the blood brain barrier (BBB) prevented a wide evaluation of chemotherapy. The authors previously reported that the combination of cisplatin (P) and etoposide (E) had strikingly high activity in patients with brain metastases from breast carcinoma. The purpose of this study was to assess, in a larger prospective study, the front-line activity of that combination against brain metastases from breast carcinoma (BC), nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), and malignant melanoma (MM) in patients previously untreated with radiotherapy. METHODS: From December 1986 to July 1993, 116 patients received P 100 mg/m2 on Day 1 and E 100 mg/m2 on Days 1, 3, and 5 or on Days 4, 6, and 8 every 3 weeks. An insignificant change in the E schedule using the same dose on a random basis assured the prospective enrollment and the registration of all cases. Six patients were not eligible and three patients were excluded from the analysis because they were lost to follow-up shortly after the date of registration. One-hundred seven patients were considered for analysis. The distribution according to the primary tumor site was BC in 56 patients (52%), NSCLC in 43 (40%), and MM in 8 (8%). The first evaluation of response was performed after two cycles. In cases of no disease progression, chemotherapy was continued to a maximum of six cycles. RESULTS: Among the 56 patients with BC, 7 achieved complete response (CR) (13%), 14 achieved partial response (PR), 12 had no change (NC), 15 had progressive disease (PD), and 8 had insufficient treatment or response was not assessed. The CR plus rate was 38%. Among the 43 patients with NSCLC, 3 achieved CR (7%), 10 achieved PR, 15 had SD, 7 had PD, and 8 had insufficient treatment or response was not assessed. The CR plus PR rate was 30%. None of the eight patients with MM achieved an objective response. The median survival was 31 weeks for patients with BC (range, 0-287), 32 for patients with NSCLC (0-392+), and 17 for patients with MM (2-48). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of P and E is effective for patients with brain metastases from BC and NSCLC. In this study, the response rate was of the same order as that reported for disseminated disease without central nervous system involvement. The survival figures compare favorably with some others reported in the literature for patients given radiotherapy. A randomized study is warranted to compare this chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy with radiotherapy alone for patients with brain metastases from BC or NSCLC not amenable to surgery or radiosurgery.",1
Anti-angiogenic effect of tamoxifen combined with epirubicin in breast cancer patients.,"Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) are the key factors mediating neo-vascularization. They are often coexpressed in breast cancer. Sex steroids may stimulate angiogenesis via the estrogen receptor (ER) pathway. We investigated to compare the effects of the addition of tamoxifen to epirubicin versus epirubicin alone on VEGF and VEGFR2 expression in breast cancer patients. The expression of VEGF and VEGFR2 was assessed on tissue microarray by immunohistochemistry at baseline conditions and after treatments in the case of 191 patients with T2-4 N0-1 breast cancer enrolled in a randomized trial comparing four cycles of single agent epirubicin versus epirubicin plus tamoxifen as primary systemic treatment. Epirubicin alone failed to induce changes in VEGF expression (P = 0.54), while the addition of tamoxifen to epirubicin resulted in a significant reduction in VEGF expression (P < 0.001). As a consequence, baseline VEGF had a negative prognostic role in patients who received epirubicin alone but not in patients receiving epirubicin plus tamoxifen (interaction test P < 0.05). VEGFR2 expression increased at residual tumor histology in both treatment arms, with a lesser extent in patients receiving tamoxifen plus epirubicin. Decrease in VEGFR2 expression was significantly associated with response rate (P = 0.02). The addition of tamoxifen to epirubicin resulted in a suppression of a key angiogenic pathway. These data suggest a potential synergism of these two drugs.",0
"A randomized study of aprepitant, ondansetron and dexamethasone for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in Chinese breast cancer patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy.","OBJECTIVES: This is a single center, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study to evaluate the NK(1)-receptor antagonist, aprepitant, in Chinese breast cancer patients. The primary objective was to compare the efficacy of aprepitant-based antiemetic regimen and standard antiemetic regimen for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in patients who received moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. The secondary objective was to compare the patient-reported quality of life in these two groups of patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible breast cancer patients were chemotherapy-naive and treated with adjuvant AC chemotherapy (i.e. doxorubicin 60 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2)). Patients were randomly assigned to either an aprepitant-based regimen (day 1, aprepitant 125 mg, ondansetron 8 mg, and dexamethasone 12 mg before chemotherapy and ondansetron 8 mg 8 h later; days 2 through 3, aprepitant 80 qd) or a control arm which consisted of standard regimen (day 1, ondansetron 8 mg and dexamethasone 20 mg before chemotherapy and ondansetron 8 mg 8 h later; days 2 through 3, ondansetron 8 mg bid). Data on nausea, vomiting, and use of rescue medication were collected with a self-report diary, patients quality of life were assessed by self-administered Functional Living Index-Emesis (FLIE). RESULTS: Of 127 patients randomized, 124 were assessable. For CINV in Cycle 1 AC, there was no significant difference in the proportion of patients with reported complete response, complete protection, total control, 'no vomiting', 'no significant nausea' and 'no nausea'. The requirement of rescue medication appears to be lesser in patients treated with the aprepitant-based regimen compared to those with the standard regimen (11% vs. 20%; P = 0.06). Assessment of FLIE revealed that while there was no difference in the nausea domain and the total score between the two groups; however, patients receiving standard antiemetic regimen had significantly worse quality of life in the vomiting domain (mean score [SD] = 23.99 [30.79]) when compared with those who received the aprepitant-based regimen (mean score [SD] = 3.40 [13.18]) (P = 0.0002). Both treatments were generally well tolerated. Patients treated with the aprepitant-based regimen had a significantly lower incidence of neutropenia (53.2% vs. 35.5%, P = 0.0468), grade >or= 3 neutropenia (21.0% vs. 45.2, P = 0.0042) and delay in subsequent cycle of chemotherapy (8.1% vs. 27.4%, P = 0.0048). CONCLUSION: The aprepitant regimen appears to reduce the requirement of rescue medication when compared with the control regimen for prevention of CINV in patients receiving both an anthracycline and cyclophosphamide, and is associated with a better quality of life during adjuvant AC chemotherapy.",0
The effects of tibolone in older postmenopausal women.,"BACKGROUND: Tibolone has estrogenic, progestogenic, and androgenic effects. Although tibolone prevents bone loss, its effects on fractures, breast cancer, and cardiovascular disease are uncertain. METHODS: In this randomized study, we assigned 4538 women, who were between the ages of 60 and 85 years and had a bone mineral density T score of -2.5 or less at the hip or spine or a T score of -2.0 or less and radiologic evidence of a vertebral fracture, to receive once-daily tibolone (at a dose of 1.25 mg) or placebo. Annual spine radiographs were used to assess for vertebral fracture. Rates of cardiovascular events and breast cancer were adjudicated by expert panels. RESULTS: During a median of 34 months of treatment, the tibolone group, as compared with the placebo group, had a decreased risk of vertebral fracture, with 70 cases versus 126 cases per 1000 person-years (relative hazard, 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41 to 0.74; P<0.001), and a decreased risk of nonvertebral fracture, with 122 cases versus 166 cases per 1000 person-years (relative hazard, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.93; P=0.01). The tibolone group also had a decreased risk of invasive breast cancer (relative hazard, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.80; P=0.02) and colon cancer (relative hazard, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.96; P=0.04). However, the tibolone group had an increased risk of stroke (relative hazard, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.14 to 4.23; P=0.02), for which the study was stopped in February 2006 at the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring board. There were no significant differences in the risk of either coronary heart disease or venous thromboembolism between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Tibolone reduced the risk of fracture and breast cancer and possibly colon cancer but increased the risk of stroke in older women with osteoporosis.

Prospective multicenter randomized phase III study of weekly versus standard docetaxel (D2) for first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer.SO: Oncology,"PURPOSE: Previous phase II studies have indicated a greatly reduced hematotoxicity of docetaxel-based regimens administered on weekly schedules. The present trial was initiated to randomly compare the toxicity and efficacy of weekly docetaxel versus its standard 3-weekly application.METHODS: Patients previously untreated with chemotherapy for metastatic disease were recruited. Patients aged >60 years or with a Karnofsky Perfomance Status (KPS) of 60-80% were eligible for the D2 study. Patients were randomized to receive docetaxel either on a 3-weekly [75 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks (q3w)] or on a weekly (30 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15; q4w) schedule. Treatment was continued until a maximum of 8 cycles, unacceptable toxicity, or disease progression. All patients received standard corticosteroid prophylaxis.RESULTS: Since statistical significance for the primary endpoint (toxicity) was achieved in the interim analysis, the study was closed according to the study protocol (102 of 162 patients). Compared to the standard arm, leukopenia ≥grade 3 was a rare event in the weekly arm of the D2 study (per-patient analysis: 4.2% q1w vs. 51.9% q3w; p < 0.0001). No difference was observed between the 2 schedules regarding the occurrence of anemia or thrombocytopenia. With regard to nonhematological toxicity, there was a higher incidence of skin/nail and hepatological toxicity with the weekly schedule, whereas neurotoxicity was observed more often in the standard arm. The rate of omitted doses was significantly increased in the weekly arm (8.6% q1w vs. 0% q3w). The overall response rate was 22.9% in the weekly arm compared to 42.6% in the standard arm (p = 0.039). Time to progression was 5.4 (q1w) versus 6.3 (q3w) months (p = 0.91), and overall survival was 22.7 (q1w) versus 15.8 (q3w) months (p = 0.24).CONCLUSION: The present data support the feasibility of both weekly and 3-weekly application of docetaxel. As expected, severe leukopenia seems avoidable in weekly scheduled single-agent docetaxel and may serve as an important treatment option, particularly in elderly patients and patients with a reduced performance status.",1
"Three dose regimens of fulvestrant in postmenopausal Japanese women with advanced breast cancer: results from a double-blind, phase II comparative study (FINDER1).","BACKGROUND: FINDER1 compared efficacy, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of three fulvestrant dose regimens in postmenopausal Japanese women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive locally advanced/metastatic breast cancer recurring or progressing after prior endocrine therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The primary end point of this randomised, multicentre, phase II study was objective response rate (ORR) and the secondary end points included time to progression (TTP), clinical benefit rate (CBR), PK profiles and tolerability. Postmenopausal women with ER-positive advanced breast cancer were randomised to 28-day cycles of fulvestrant approved dose (AD), loading dose (LD) or high dose (HD) until disease progression. RESULTS: Hundred and forty-three patients (median age 61 years) received fulvestrant AD (n = 45), LD (n = 51) or HD (n = 47). ORR was similar across dose regimens: 11.1%, 17.6% and 10.6% for AD, LD and HD, respectively, with overlapping confidence intervals. TTP and CBR were also similar between groups (median TTP: 6.0, 7.5 and 6.0 months, respectively; CBR: 42.2%, 54.9% and 46.8% for AD, LD and HD, respectively). C(max) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve were dose proportional and PK steady state was reached earlier with LD and HD than with AD. All three doses were well tolerated, with a similar adverse-event profile and no emerging safety concerns. CONCLUSION: Fulvestrant AD, LD and HD had similar efficacy and tolerability profiles in postmenopausal Japanese women with ER-positive advanced breast cancer.",1
"A pilot study of mitomycin-C and tamoxifen (MT) versus dibromodulcitol, adriamycin, and tamoxifen (DAT).","The aim of this study was to compare the treatment efficacy of mitomycin-C plus tamoxifen (MT) to adriamycin, dibromodulcitol and tamoxifen (DAT) in previously treated patients with metastatic breast cancer. Thirty-two patients with measurable or evaluable disease were entered on the study. Twenty-three were prospectively randomized to receive DAT (Group 1) or MT (Group 2). Nine patients with prior exposure to adriamycin were directly assigned to receive MT (Group 3). Thirty-one patients were evaluable for response and toxicity. The hematological toxicities were comparable among the three treatment groups. DAT gave more nausea and vomiting than MT. One patient developed irreversible fatal congestive heart failure while receiving DAT. The response for Group 1 was 5/11, Group 2, 3/12, and Group 3, 3/8. The duration of response for patients in Group 1 was 455+, 315, 251, 239, 231 days, in Group 2 it was 328+, 144+, 119, and in Group 3 it was 35+, 84, and 112 days. The median time to treatment failure did not differ significantly between Group 1 (114 days), 2 (83 days) and 3 (61 days) (p = 0.24). The median survival time was similar among the three groups (p = 0.41). This pilot study suggests that MT and DAT are both effective treatment programs in patients with metastatic breast cancer who have failed prior chemotherapy regimens.",1

Long-term results of breast conserving surgery vs. mastectomy for early stage invasive breast cancer: 20-year follow-up of the Danish randomized DBCG-82TM protocol.,"The main objective of the present study aims at comparing the long-term efficacy of breast conserving surgery (BCS) vs. mastectomy (M) based on a randomized design. The Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (DBCG) conducted the trial (DBCG-82TM) from January 1983 to March 1989 recruiting 1154 patients with invasive breast carcinoma. Follow-up time ended 1(st) May 2006 with a median follow-up time of 19.6 years (time span 17.1-23.3 years). Eligibility criteria included a one-sided, unifocal, primary operable breast carcinoma, patient age below 70 years, probability of satisfactory cosmetic outcome with BCS, and no evidence of disseminated disease. The patients accrued were grouped into three subsets: correctly randomized, suspicion of randomization error, and declining randomization. The main analyses focus on the subgroup of 793 correctly randomized patients representing 70% of the complete series. 10-year recurrence free survival (RFS) and 20-year overall survival (OS) based on intent to treat did not reveal significant differences in outcome between breast conserving surgery vs. mastectomy, p=0.95 and p=0.10, respectively. Including the complete series comprising 1133 eligible patients based on treatment in fact given similarly no significant difference between surgical options could be traced in outcome of 10-year RFS and 20-year OS, p=0.94 and p=0.24, respectively. The pattern of recurrences as a first event in breast conservation vs. mastectomy did not differ significantly irrespective of site, p=0.27. Looking into the type of local relapse, viz., new primaries vs. true recurrences, it appeared that new primaries were significantly associated to BCS, while true recurrences dominated among M treated patients (p<0.001). In conclusion, long-term data indicate that BCS in eligible patients proves as effective as mastectomy both regarding local tumour control, RFS and OS. Local failures as a first event consistent with new primaries are strongly associated with BCS, whereas true recurrence predominates after mastectomy.",0
Activity of combination chemotherapy in brain metastases from breast and lung adenocarcinoma.,"Brain metastases represent a common complication of breast and lung cancer, with an overall incidence exceeding 30-40% of cases. Results achieved with radiotherapy are disappointing, with a median survival of a few months, and no clear activity has been observed with chemotherapy. The aims of this study were to assess the activity and feasibility of a new chemotherapeutic approach according to the following schedule: lomustine, 80 mg/m2 day 1; carboplatin, 80 mg/m2 days 1, 8, 15, 22; vinorelbine, 20 mg/m2 days 1, 8, 15, 22; L-leucovorin 250 mg/m2 days 1, 8, 15, 22; and fluorouracil, 500 mg/m2 days 1, 8, 15, 22. Cycles were repeated every 6 weeks. Since January 1994, 28 patients have been enrolled and 26 are evaluable for response and side effects. Major patient characteristics were median age, 55 years (range 31-72); men/women 15/11; lung primary, 20; breast primary, 6; performance status Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, 0-2. A total of 64 cycles were administered (median/patient, two cycles). Nine partial remissions have been observed (35%, 95% confidence interval 17-56%), 6 disease stabilizations, and 11 disease progressions. Median duration of response was 3 months, and median time to progression for the whole group was 3.7 months (range 1-7). Treatment was well tolerated. Mild or moderate side effects included neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, mucositis, and nausea/vomiting; grade III-IV toxicity included neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. In conclusion, our results indicate that the schedule proposed is feasible and effective in this subset of patients.",1
Activity of ixabepilone in oestrogen receptor-negative and oestrogen receptor-progesterone receptor-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer.,"Oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer, including oestrogen receptor-, progesterone receptor- and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (ER/PR/HER2-negative) breast cancer, is more aggressive than ER-positive disease. A major limitation in the treatment of ER-negative disease subtypes is the inherent insensitivity to hormonal agents (tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors) that are widely used in the treatment of breast cancer. Thus, therapeutic options for poor prognosis patients with ER-negative breast cancer are limited to a handful of chemotherapeutic agents, and new agents are needed to improve the treatment of this disease. Ixabepilone, a novel epothilone B analogue with low susceptibility to cellular mechanisms that confer resistance to taxanes and other chemotherapeutic agents, has demonstrated potent preclinical antitumour activity in multiple models, including those with primary or acquired drug resistance. This review summarises the results of a prospective subset analysis from a phase III clinical trial evaluating ixabepilone for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC), in which efficacy and safety were evaluated in patients with ER-negative and ER/PR/HER2-negative disease.",0
"Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase II study of axitinib plus docetaxel versus docetaxel plus placebo in patients with metastatic breast cancer.","PURPOSE: This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, phase II study assessed safety and efficacy of axitinib plus docetaxel in metastatic breast cancer (MBC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women with MBC were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive docetaxel 80 mg/m2 once every 3 weeks plus axitinib 5 mg twice per day (combination arm) or placebo (placebo arm), following a lead-in phase I trial. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP). RESULTS: In all, 168 patients were enrolled; 112 were randomly assigned to axitinib and 56 to placebo. Median TTP was numerically longer in the combination arm than in the placebo arm (8.1 v 7.1 months), but this difference was not statistically significant (hazard ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.87; one-sided P = .156). The difference in median TTP was greatest among patients who had received prior adjuvant chemotherapy (9.2 v 7.0 months; P = .043, prespecified subgroup analysis). Objective response rate was higher in the combination arm (41.1% v 23.6%; P = .011). The most common grades 3 to 4 treatment-related adverse events (combination/placebo) included diarrhea (10.8%/0%), fatigue (10.8%/5.4%), stomatitis (12.6%/1.8%), mucositis (9.0%/0%), asthenia (7.2%/0%), and hypertension (4.5%/0%). Three patients in the combination arm experienced serious thromboembolic events (one death). Febrile neutropenia was more frequent in the combination arm (15.3% v 7.1%); rates of other hematologic toxicities were comparable. Increased toxicity with axitinib was generally managed by dose reduction and/or growth factor support. CONCLUSION: The addition of axitinib to docetaxel did not improve TTP in first-line MBC treatment. Combination therapy may be more effective in patients previously exposed to adjuvant chemotherapy.",1
"Tamoxifen, radiation therapy, or both for prevention of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence after lumpectomy in women with invasive breast cancers of one centimeter or less.","PURPOSE: This trial was prompted by uncertainty about the need for breast irradiation after lumpectomy in node-negative women with invasive breast cancers of </= 1 cm, by speculation that tamoxifen (TAM) might be as or more effective than radiation therapy (XRT) in reducing the rate of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) in such women, and by the thesis that both modalities might be more effective than either alone. PATIENTS AND METHODS: After lumpectomy, 1,009 women were randomly assigned to TAM (n = 336), XRT and placebo (n = 336), or XRT and TAM (n = 337). Rates of IBTR, distant recurrence, and contralateral breast cancer (CBC) were among the end points for analysis. Cumulative incidence of IBTR and of CBC was computed accounting for competing risks. Results with two-sided P values of.05 or less were statistically significant. RESULTS: XRT and placebo resulted in a 49% lower hazard rate of IBTR than did TAM alone; XRT and TAM resulted in a 63% lower rate than did XRT and placebo. When compared with TAM alone, XRT plus TAM resulted in an 81% reduction in hazard rate of IBTR. Cumulative incidence of IBTR through 8 years was 16.5% with TAM, 9.3% with XRT and placebo, and 2.8% with XRT and TAM. XRT reduced IBTR below the level achieved with TAM alone, regardless of estrogen receptor (ER) status. Distant treatment failures were infrequent and not significantly different among the groups (P =.28). When TAM-treated women were compared with those who received XRT and placebo, there was a significant reduction in CBC (hazard ratio, 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.21 to 0.95; P =.039). Survival in the three groups was 93%, 94%, and 93%, respectively (P =.93). CONCLUSION: In women with tumors </= 1 cm, IBTR occurs with enough frequency after lumpectomy to justify considering XRT, regardless of tumor ER status, and TAM plus XRT when tumors are ER positive.",0
Phase I study of L-asparaginase (NSC 109229).,"22 patients received intravenously infused L-asparaginase (Escherichia coli) on a protocol for 5 weekly doses. 13 patients received 100 U/kg, 1 patient 500 U/kg, and 8 patients 1,500 U/kg. Only 3 of the 9 patients receiving 500 U/kg or more were able to complete the 5-week protocol. 11 of the 13 patients receiving 100 U/kg were able to complete the 5-week protocol. Significant tumor responses were not seen. CNS toxicity and allergic reactions were observed at high- and low-dose levels. There was no difference as to the degree of protein changes, BUN elevation, or liver function abnormalities at the different dose levels.",0
Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis: laser-assisted surgical treatment or conventional surgery?,"Bisphosphonates (BSPs) are used for the treatment of multiple myeloma, metastatic breast and lung cancer, Paget's disease, osteoporosis, hypercalcemia due to malignancy, and many other skeletal diseases. BSPs reduce osteoclastic functions, which result in bone resorption. Bisphosphonates-related osteonecrosis of jaws (BRONJ) is a newly developed term that is used to describe the significant complication in patients receiving bisphosphonates. BSPs are known to exhibit an anti-angiogenetic effect that initiates tissue necrosis of the hard tissue. There is currently no consensus on the correct approach to this issue. The aim of this retrospective study is to compare the effects of laser surgery with biostimulation to conventional surgery in the treatment of BSP-induced avascular bone necrosis on 20 patients who have been treated in our clinic. BRONJ was evaluated in patients with lung, prostate, and breast cancer under intravenous BSP treatment. Twenty patients in this study developed mandibular or maxillary avascular necrosis after a minor tooth extraction surgery or spontaneously. Bone turnover rates were evaluated by serum terminal C-telopeptide levels (CTX) using the electrochemiluminescence immunoassay technique and patients were treated with laser or conventional surgical treatments and medical therapy. Ten patients were treated with laser surgery and biostimulation. An Er:YAG laser (Fotona Fidelis Plus II® Combine laser equipment, Slovenia) very long pulse (VLP) mode (200 mJ, 20 Hz) using a fiber tip 1.3 mm in diameter and 12 mm in length was used to remove the necrotic and granulation tissues from the area of avascular necrosis. Biostimulation was applied postoperatively using an Nd:YAG laser. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) was applied to the tissues for 1 min from 4 cm distance using an Nd:YAG laser (Fotona-Slovenia) with a R24 950-µm fiber handpiece long-pulse (LP) mode, 0.25-W, 10 Hz power/cm(2) from the mentioned distance the spot size was 0.4 cm(2), and power output was 2.5 J. Energy density from the mentioned distance was calculated to be 6.25 J/cm(2). The other ten patients were treated with conventional surgery. Treatment outcomes were noted as either complete healing or incomplete healing. There were no statistically significant differences between laser surgery and conventional surgery (p > 0.05). CTX values also did not affect the prognosis of the patients. Treatment outcomes were significantly better in patients with stage II osteonecrosis than in patients with stage I osteonecrosis. Our findings suggest that dental evaluation of the patients prior to medication is an important factor in the prevention of BRONJ. Laser surgery is a beneficial alternative in the treatment of patients with this situation. Further randomized studies with larger patient numbers may also improve our understanding of treatment protocols for this situation.",0
Randomized phase II trial of first-line trastuzumab plus docetaxel and capecitabine compared with trastuzumab plus docetaxel in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.,"PURPOSE To evaluate trastuzumab (H) and docetaxel (T) with or without capecitabine (X) as first-line combination therapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -positive advanced breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with HER2-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer were randomly assigned to H (8 mg/kg loading; 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks) plus T (75 mg/m(2) in HTX arm, 100 mg/m(2) in HT arm, every 3 weeks) with or without X (950 mg/m(2) twice per day on days 1 to 14 every 3 weeks). The primary end point was overall response rate (ORR). Results In 222 patients, median follow-up was approximately 24 months. ORR was high with both regimens (70.5% with HTX; 72.7% with HT; P = .717); complete response rate was 23.2% with HTX compared with 16.4% with HT. HTX demonstrated significantly longer progression-free survival: median 17.9 months compared with 12.8 months with HT (hazard ratio, 0.72; P = .045), which translates to a gain of around 5 months. Two-year survival probability was 75% with HTX compared with 66% with HT. Febrile neutropenia (27% v 15%) and grade 3/4 neutropenia (77% v 54%) incidences were higher with HT than HTX. Treatment-related grade 3 hand-foot syndrome (17% v < 1%) and grade 3/4 diarrhea (11% v 4%) occurred more commonly with HTX than HT. One case of congestive heart failure occurred in each arm. CONCLUSION HTX is an effective and feasible first-line therapy for HER2-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, although it should be reserved for patients with good performance status who are not receiving long-term steroids.",1
The use of bone markers in a 6-week study to assess the efficacy of oral clodronate in patients with metastatic bone disease.,"Biochemical markers of bone metabolism are strongly associated with skeletal complications in metastatic bone disease. The bisphosphonate clodronate reduces skeletal morbidity by inhibiting bone resorption. This study investigated the use of bone markers to assess the efficacy of oral clodronate across a range of clinically relevant doses. There were 125 patients with metastatic bone disease randomized to daily oral clodronate (800, 1,600, 2,400 and 3,200 mg) or placebo in a double-blind, multicenter study. Urinary N-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (U-NTX), serum C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (S-CTX), urinary calcium (U-Ca), and bone alkaline phosphatase were measured weekly for a 6-week treatment period. Doses of >or=1,600 mg clodronate produced mean reductions of >40% in U-NTX, S-CTX and U-Ca, all significantly different from placebo (P=0.0015, 0.001, 0.0036, respectively), after 6 weeks. Evaluation of least significant changes in markers suggested that the commonly used 1,600 mg dose was most appropriate for breast cancer patients. However, this dose was suboptimal for other (mainly prostate cancer) patients, who showed better response to 2,400 mg. The number of adverse events in the treatment arms was not significantly different from that in placebo, but a higher number of patients had diarrhea in the 3,200 mg arm and withdrew from the study. This trial is the first to explore the dose-response relationship of clodronate in oncology using specific markers of bone turnover. It has confirmed that the 1,600 mg dose is safe and effective for breast cancer patients but may be suboptimal for the other tumors studied.",0
p53 expression and the result of adjuvant therapy of breast cancer.,"Functional p53 protein is essential for the cellular response to drug-induced DNA damage. We investigated p53 accumulation in tumour specimens from premenopausal breast cancer patients who were randomised to adjuvant chemotherapy (CMF) or postoperative radiotherapy. Of the tumours from 139 patients, 20 showed abnormal accumulation as judged with immunohistochemistry (> 10% positive tumour cells). The risk of distant recurrence was similar in the two treatment groups for patients whose primary tumours lacked p53 accumulation, whereas there was a significant benefit from CMF for patients showing abnormal accumulation (relative risk 0.18, 95% CI, 0.04-0.93). This result suggests that p53-dependent apoptosis is not a general mechanism by which breast cancer cells respond during CMF chemotherapy.",0
PKA-induced phosphorylation of ERα at serine 305 and high PAK1 levels is associated with sensitivity to tamoxifen in ER-positive breast cancer.,"Phosphorylation of estrogen receptor α at serine 305 (ERαS305-P) by protein kinase A (PKA) or p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) has experimentally been associated with tamoxifen sensitivity. Here, we investigated the clinical application of this knowledge to predict tamoxifen resistance in ER-positive breast cancer patients. Using immunohistochemistry, a score including PAK1 and co-expression of PKA and ERαS305-P (PKA/ERαS305-P) was developed on a training set consisting of 103 patients treated with tamoxifen for metastatic disease, and validated on 231 patients randomized between adjuvant tamoxifen or no treatment. In the training set, PAK1 levels were associated with tumor progression after tamoxifen (HR 1.57, 95% CI 0.99-2.48), as was co-expression of PKA and ERαS305-P (HR 2.00, 95% CI 1.14-3.52). In the validation set, a significant tamoxifen benefit was found among the 73% patients negative for PAK1 and PKA/ERαS305-P (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34-0.87), while others (27%) were likely to have no benefit from tamoxifen (HR 0.88, 95% 0.42-1.82). The test for interaction showed a significant difference in recurrence-free survival between groups defined by PAK1 and PKA/ERαS305-P (P = 0.037). Elevated PAK1 and PKA/ERαS305-P appeared to influence tamoxifen sensitivity. Both PAK1 and PKA/ERαS305-P levels were associated with sensitivity to tamoxifen in breast tumors and the combination of these variables should be considered in predicting tamoxifen benefit.",0
"Subcutaneous administration of recombinant glycosylated interleukin 6 in patients with cancer: pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and immunomodulatory effects.","This is the first report of the serum profile of a glycosylated recombinant form of human IL-6 (rhIL-6) administered subcutaneously (1-10 microg/kg/day) in a phase I/II trial as a thrombopoietic agent in patients with advanced cancer. The pharmacodynamic effects of IL-6 were also examined. Detailed pharmacokinetic measurements were made in four patients. Peak concentrations at 5-8 h and a median t0.5 of ca. 5 h were similar to those previously reported for non-glycosylated IL-6. However, higher peak concentrations and apparent differences in effective dose levels to those previously reported with the non-glycosylated form were seen. Indications of an apparent attenuation in circulating IL-6 concentrations with continuing injections were seen in eight of 10 patients examined but anti-IL-6 antibody generation was seen in only two patients. Soluble interleukin 6 receptor concentrations generally decreased. No major changes in T cell subsets were seen but expression of CD25 and CD54 by T lymphocytes significantly increased, accompanied by marked increases in soluble CD25 (sIL-2R) and CD54 (sICAM-1). No consistent change in B cells, monocytes or NK cells were seen. No evidence for induction of TNF-alpha was found. This study demonstrates similar biological effects of glycosylated rhIL-6 to those reported for the non-glycosylated form but illustrates several apparent differences which are discussed further.",0
Evaluation of the prognostic and predictive value of p53 and Bcl-2 in breast cancer patients participating in a randomized study with dose-dense sequential adjuvant chemotherapy.,"PURPOSE: To assess the prognostic and predictive significance of p53 and Bcl-2 protein expression in high risk patients with breast cancer treated with dose-dense sequential chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From June 1997 until November 2000, 595 patients were randomized to three cycles of epirubicin (E) 110 mg/m2 followed by three cycles of paclitaxel (P) 250 mg/m2 followed by three cycles of 'intensified' CMF (cyclophosphamide 840 mg/m2, methotrexate 47 mg/m2 and fluorouracil 840 mg/m2) or to four cycles of E, followed by four cycles of CMF. p53 and Bcl-2 expression was investigated by immunohistochemistry in 392 and 397 patients respectively. RESULTS: Positive expression of p53 was detected in 104 (26.5%) patients and was significantly associated with negative hormonal status, worse histologic grade, higher incidence of disease relapse and higher rate of death. p53 positive expression was a significant negative predictor of overall survival (OS) (P = 0.002) and disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.001). Negative expression of Bcl-2 was detected in 203 (51%) patients and was significantly associated with negative hormonal status. Multivariate analysis revealed that, positive p53 expression, higher number of positive nodes and worse tumor grade were related to significantly poorer OS and DFS. CONCLUSIONS: For both treatments, p53 positive expression was a significant negative prognostic factor for OS and DFS while Bcl-2 was not. No predictive ability of p53 status or Bcl-2 status for paclitaxel treatment was evident.",0
"Randomized trial of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and 5-fluorouracil alone or alternating with a ""cycle active"" non-cross-resistant combination in women with visceral metastatic breast cancer: a Southeastern Cancer Study Group project.","Patients with visceral patterns of metastatic breast cancer were stratified according to dominant metastatic site and performance status and then randomized to therapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and 5-fluorouracil (CAF) or CAF alternating with a ""cell-cycle active"" regimen including cytosine arabinoside, methotrexate with leucovorin rescue, and oncovin ( CAMELEON ). One hundred eighty-seven patients were randomized; response rate for CAF was 44% and for CAF + CAMELEON , 40%. Durations of disease control and survival were not significantly different. Toxicity of CAF was as anticipated with predominant granulocytopenia, vomiting, and alopecia. Toxicity of CAMELEON was less severe than that of CAF, and CAF toxicity was not worsened by preceding courses of CAMELEON ; however, the CAF- CAMELEON regimen was cumbersome and complex leading to both physician and patient noncompliance. Contrary to the preliminary results of a pilot study, and preliminary reports of the present trial suggesting benefit for the CAF- CAMELEON regimen the present randomized trial does not confirm any significant benefit of CAF- CAMELEON over CAF alone in patients with visceral metastatic breast cancer although this conclusion must be viewed in light of the high inevaluability rate due to patient and physician noncompliance.",1
High-dose oral medroxyprogesterone acetate or tamoxifen as adjuvant hormone therapy for node-negative early-stage breast cancer: randomized trial with 7-year update.,"A randomized adjuvant trial compared tamoxifen 20 mg daily for 5 years with high-dose oral medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 1 g orally for 9 months. One hundred ninety-four patients with histologically proven primary node-negative breast carcinoma were enrolled between December 1990 and October 1996, with 98 patients randomized into the tamoxifen arm and 96 into the MPA arm. At a median follow-up of 86 months, 25 relapses and 13 deaths were recorded. The relapse-free survival rate at 7 years in the tamoxifen arm was 93%, versus 81% in the MPA arm (P = 0.02). The difference was observed in patients with stage T2 disease (100% in the tamoxifen group vs. 64% in the MPA group; P = 0.01), in younger and/or premenopausal patients (in patients < 50 years of age, 100% in the tamoxifen arm vs. 81% in the MPA arm [P = 0.02], and in patients > or = 50 years of age, 90% in the tamoxifen arm vs. 82% in the MPA arm [P = 0.16]). Also, the overall survival rate at 7 years was lower in women < 50 years of age (P = 0.04).",1
Intrapleurally instilled mitoxantrone in metastatic pleural effusions: a phase II study.,"Thirty cases (breast cancer-20 cases, malignant lymphoma-4 cases, different malignancies-6 cases) of histologically/cytologically verified malignant pleural effusion (MPE) in 29 patients were treated with intrapleurally instilled mitoxantrone (30 mg). The therapy was well tolerated. At evaluation, 25 patients had died of progressive disease. The median survival was 3 months (range 0.3-21.3 months). There were 26 responders (12 complete responses (CR), 14 partial responses (PR)), whereas 4 patients relapsed and 3 of these had an early relapse (within 3 months). Patients achieving PR or CR had a low risk (15%) of treatment failure. Five patients were subjected to a pharmacokinetic evaluation. This demonstrated rapidly declining plasma and pleural exudate levels of mitoxantrone within the first 6 hours. At 24 hours after instillation, mitoxantrone was only detected in circulating mononuclear cells. This study shows that mitoxantrone is efficacious in the treatment of MPE, and may represent a cost-effective alternative.",1
Randomized trial of high-dose chemotherapy with autologous peripheral-blood stem-cell support compared with standard-dose chemotherapy in women with metastatic breast cancer: NCIC MA.16.,"PURPOSE: We conducted a multicenter, randomized trial to compare progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and quality of life in women with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) receiving high-dose chemotherapy plus autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT; HDCT) compared with standard-dose therapy. PATIENT AND METHODS: Between April 1997 and December 2000, 386 women with MBC and no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease were registered. After initial response to anthracycline- or taxane-based induction chemotherapy, 224 patients were randomly assigned: 112 to high-dose cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, and carboplatin chemotherapy and ASCT (HDCT), and 112 to standard therapy (ST). Median age was 47 years (range, 25 to 67 years). Thirty two percent of women randomly assigned had estrogen and progesterone receptor-negative breast cancer, 42% had visceral metastases, and 58% had bone metastases. Complete remission rates before random assignment were 11% for those receiving HDCT and 12% for those receiving ST. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 48 months, 79 deaths were observed in the HDCT arm and 77 deaths were observed in the ST arm; seven patients (6%) in the HDCT arm died as a result of toxicity. The median OS was 24 months for the HDCT arm (95% CI, 21 to 35 months) and 28 months for ST (95% CI, 22 to 33 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.9; 95% CI, 0.6 to 1.2; P = .43). PFS was 11 months for HDCT and 9 months for ST (HR, 0.6 in favor of HDCT; 95% CI, 0.5 to 0.9; P = .006). CONCLUSION: HDCT did not improve OS in women with MBC when used as consolidation after response to induction chemotherapy.",0
Biological response to hormonal manipulation in oestrogen receptor positive ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast.,"Adjuvant antioestrogen therapy with tamoxifen is recommended for all women following breast-conserving surgery for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to reduce local recurrence, despite 50% of lesions being oestrogen receptor (OR) negative. We have investigated the response to hormone manipulation in DCIS by studying changes in epithelial proliferation and progesterone receptor (PR) expression as surrogate molecular markers of treatment effects in DCIS of known OR status. Women were identified who had undergone diagnostic core biopsy followed by surgery for DCIS 14-41 days later. Ki67 (a measure of epithelial cell proliferation) and PR expression were determined by immunohistochemistry on paired paraffin sections of the core biopsy and operative specimens for each patient, with OR and HER-2 measured on the operative specimen. Women were divided into three groups according to whether they had changed hormone therapy (stopped hormone replacement therapy (HRT), group 1), continued taking HRT (group 2) or were not taking HRT (group 3) between core biopsy and surgery. In OR-positive (but not in OR-negative) DCIS after oestrogen withdrawal (group 1), a fall in the mean cell proliferation (P&<0.01) was observed. A fall in PR expression between core biopsy and surgery was also seen in this group (P=0.02). No change in either mean cell proliferation or PR expression was seen in the other two groups in OR-positive or -negative DCIS. The fall in proliferation and PR expression occurred regardless of HER-2 status. In conclusion, a biological response to hormone manipulation is only seen in OR-positive DCIS tumours. Any clinical value of antioestrogen therapy is likely to be restricted to this group.",0
Adriamycin plus alkylating agents in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.,"A randomized trial of Adriamycin (A) in combination with melphalan (M), (MA therapy), and in combination with M plus cyclophosphamide (C) (MAC therapy), was initiated in 40 evaluable patients with metastatic breast cancer. Twenty-two patients demonstrated an objective response to therapy: 9/20 to the MA regimen, and 13/20 to the MAC regimen. For the 22 responders, median duration of response is not yet achieved for either complete or partial responders, at 10 and 9 months, respectively. The addition of the two alkylating agents to Adriamycin was superior to the single alkylating agent addition, both in total response rate and in completeness of response. Maintenance therapy, after achieving the maximum cumulative dose of Adriamycin, was provided by cyclophosphamide plus methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF). In 19 patients completing induction and entering maintenance therapy, only one relapse has developed with maximun follow-up at 15 months.",1
Design of the Physical exercise during Adjuvant Chemotherapy Effectiveness Study (PACES): a randomized controlled trial to evaluate effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of physical exercise in improving physical fitness and reducing fatigue.,"BACKGROUND: Cancer chemotherapy is frequently associated with a decline in general physical condition, exercise tolerance, and muscle strength and with an increase in fatigue. While accumulating evidence suggests that physical activity and exercise interventions during chemotherapy treatment may contribute to maintaining cardiorespiratory fitness and strength, the results of studies conducted to date have not been consistent. Additional research is needed to determine the optimal intensity of exercise training programs in general and in particular the relative effectiveness of supervised, outpatient (hospital- or physical therapy practice-based) versus home-based programs.METHODS: This multicenter, prospective, randomized trial will evaluate the effectiveness of a low to moderate intensity, home-based, self-management physical activity program, and a high intensity, structured, supervised exercise program, in maintaining or enhancing physical fitness (cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle strength), in minimizing fatigue and in enhancing the health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for breast or colon cancer (n = 360) are being recruited from twelve hospitals in the Netherlands, and randomly allocated to one of the two treatment groups or to a 'usual care' control group. Performance-based and self-reported outcomes are assessed at baseline, at the end of chemotherapy and at six month follow-up.DISCUSSION: This large, multicenter, randomized clinical trial will provide additional empirical evidence regarding the effectiveness of physical exercise during adjuvant chemotherapy in enhancing physical fitness, minimizing fatigue, and maintaining or enhancing patients' quality of life. If demonstrated to be effective, exercise intervention programs will be a welcome addition to the standard program of care offered to patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is registered at the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR 2159).",0
Low-fat dietary pattern and change in body-composition traits in the Women's Health Initiative Dietary Modification Trial.,"BACKGROUND: The Women's Health Initiative Dietary Modification (DM) Trial was a randomized controlled trial that compared the effects of a low-fat (≤20% of total energy) or a usual diet in relation to chronic disease risk in postmenopausal women.OBJECTIVE: We characterized long-term body-composition changes associated with the DM trial and potential modifiers of these associations.DESIGN: In the DM trial, 48,835 women aged 50-79 y were randomly assigned to intervention (40%) or comparison (60%) groups. We studied a subset with whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans at baseline and during follow-up. Changes in fat mass (FM), lean mass (LM), and percentage body fat between the intervention (n = 1580) and comparison (n = 2731) groups at years 1, 3, and 6 were compared. By using generalized estimating equations, we calculated overall differences between groups and tested for interactions with age, diabetes, race-ethnicity (white, black, and Hispanic), body mass index (BMI), and hormone therapy (HT).RESULTS: The intervention women experienced significantly greater reductions in percentage body fat, FM, and LM at years 1 and 3 than did women in the comparison group (all P < 0.05). At year 6, only the FM change was significantly different between groups. Overall, the intervention was associated with reductions in percentage body fat (-0.8%; 95% CI: -1.0%, -0.6%), FM (-1.1 kg; 95% CI: -1.3, -0.8 kg), and LM (-0.17 kg; 95% CI: -0.28, -0.06 kg) during follow-up (all P < 0.003). Intervention associations varied by race-ethnicity, BMI, diabetes, and HT and remained significant after adjustment for physical activity.CONCLUSION: This intervention was associated with modest long-term body-composition changes; the findings were more robust in years 1 and 3. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00000611.",0
Weekly vinorelbine versus docetaxel for metastatic breast cancer after failing anthracycline treatment.,"BACKGROUND: Vinorelbine and docetaxel are active in anthracycline-pretreated, metastatic breast cancer. We compared their efficacy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive weekly vinorelbine (VIN) or weekly docetaxel (DOC), 6 weekly doses per 8-week cycle, with optional crossover (X-DOC vs. X-VIN. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP) on initial treatment. Remission induction, survival, and quality of life were secondary end points. RESULTS: Among 122 poor risk patients, a non-significant trend for better TTP was seen for DOC, both on initial and on crossover treatment. Responses were seen on either treatment, but progression was more common with VIN than with DOC, while more patients had a response with X-DOC than with X-VIN. Survival was identical in those receiving only the initial VIN vs. DOC and in the subgroups receiving crossover treatments. Grade 3-4 toxicity, especially hematological toxicity resulting in treatment delay, was more common with VIN. Non-graded toxicity contributed to abandoning DOC. Quality of life scores reflected worse results in patients crossing treatment arms, in either direction. CONCLUSIONS: DOC showed marginally better activity but did not improve TTP or other endpoints over VIN in this poor risk population.",1
Cyclophosphamide augments the anti-tumor efficacy of uracil and tegafur by inhibiting dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase.,"The present study assesses the effects of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) with uracil and tegafur (UFT) alone vs UFT plus cyclophosphamide (CPA), on the activity of thymidylate synthase (TS) and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) in breast cancer tissues. Breast cancer patients were randomly assigned to 3 groups; the control (no-treatment) group (n=13), the UFT (5-8 mg/kg/day) alone group (n=10) and the UFT plus CPA (1 mg/kg/one day interval) (UC) group (n=9), and they received NAC for 2-4 weeks. A total of 32 invasive ductal breast carcinomas were used to assay for TS and DPD activity. There were no statistically significant differences in tumor size or stage classification between the 3 groups. The DPD activity was inversely and significantly correlated with the tumor size and pT, but the TS activity was not correlated with these clinicopathological factors. The TS activity was decreased by NAC with UFT, and the addition of CPA resulted in an increased inhibition of TS activity. In contrast, DPD activity was increased by NAC with UFT administration, but its increased activity was significantly inhibited by the addition of CPA. Multiple regression analyses demonstrated that the total dose of UFT was a significant variable for inhibiting TS activity, and that CPA was a significant variable for inhibiting DPD activity. The DPD activity increased by UFT can be inhibited by CPA, and this may represent one of the possible mechanisms responsible for the anti-tumor activity of 5-FU or its derivatives as enhanced by CPA.",0
Randomized trial of two different doses of pyridoxine in the prevention of capecitabine-associated palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia.,"AIM: The aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy of 200 mg versus 400 mg daily of pyridoxine in preventing or delaying the onset of palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) in capecitabine-treated patients.METHODS: Patients with histologically confirmed breast cancer or colorectal cancer receiving single agent capecitabine started at 2000 to 2500 mg/m(2) daily from day 1 to 14 every 3 weeks were randomly assigned to receive 200 mg or 400 mg daily of pyridoxine for PPE prophylaxis. The primary endpoint was the reduction of incidence of grade 2 or greater PPE. Secondary endpoints were reduction of severe PPE and prolongation of time to development of grade 2 or greater PPE.RESULTS: There were 56 patients in this study. The baseline characteristics were generally similar in both groups. The high dose arm had less PPE than the low dose arm (11 of 28 or 39% vs 20 of 28 or 71%, relative risk = 0.26 [0.08, 0.79], P = 0.031). Grade III PPE developed in 3 of 28 (10.7%) versus none in patients receiving 200 mg versus 400 mg pyridoxine, respectively (relative risk 2.12 [1.594, 2.819], P = 0.24). High dose pyridoxine had a longer time to development of grade 2 or greater PPE compared to the low dose arm, 87 days versus 62 days. The 400 mg pyridoxine group had, however, a worsened tumor response and tended to have greater tumor treatment failure and shorter time to treatment failure.CONCLUSION: With the limitation of sample size in this study, there was a trend to improve PPE incidence and time to event with a higher dose of pyridoxine. Further validation of these results in a larger population is warranted.",0
Value of post-operative reassessment of estrogen receptor α expression following neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without gefitinib for estrogen receptor negative breast cancer.,"The NICE trial was designed to evaluate the possible benefits of adding epidermal growth factor receptor targeted therapy to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with estrogen receptor α (ER) negative and operable breast cancer. Preclinical data have suggested that signalling through the ErbB receptors or downstream effectors may repress ER expression. Here the authors investigated whether gefitinib, given neoadjuvant in combination with epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (EC), could restore ER expression. Eligible patients in the NICE trial were women with unilateral, primary operable, ER negative invasive breast cancer ≥ 2 cm. Material from patients randomized and completing treatment (four cycles of neoadjuvant EC plus 12 weeks of either gefitinib or placebo) in the NICE trial having available ER status both at baseline and after neoadjuvant treatment were eligible for this study. Tumors with indication of changed ER phenotype (based on collected pathology reports) were immunohistochemically reassessed centrally. 115 patients were eligible for this study; 59 patients in the gefitinib group and 56 patients in the placebo group. Five (4.3%) of 115 tumors changed ER phenotype from negative to positive. A change was seen in three patients in the gefitinib (5.1%) and in two patients in the placebo (3.6%) group with a difference of 1.51% (95% CI, -6.1-9.1). Results of the NICE trial have been reported previously. Post-operative reassessment of ER expression changed the assessment of ER status in a small but significant fraction of patients and should, whenever possible, be performed following neoadjuvant chemotherapy for ER negative breast cancer. Gefitinib did not affect the reversion rate of ER negative tumors.",0
Paclitaxel administered by 1-hour infusion. Preliminary results of a phase I/II trial comparing two schedules.,"BACKGROUND: Paclitaxel currently is administered by prolonged intravenous infusion because of the occurrence of severe hypersensitivity reactions in patients in early clinical trials. However, intensive premedication probably is more important in eliminating allergic reactions than is the length of infusion. The authors evaluated the feasibility of two paclitaxel schedules using a 1-hour, outpatient infusion. METHODS: Fifty-six patients with advanced, refractory malignancies were randomized to receive one of two paclitaxel schedules: 135 mg/m2 administered as a single dose over 1 hour, or 135 mg/m2 administered in divided daily doses for 3 days, each over 1 hour. All patients were premedicated with dexamethasone, diphenhydramine, and cimetidine. RESULTS: No serious hypersensitivity reactions occurred with either schedule of paclitaxel. In addition, other adverse effects were usually mild and easily tolerated. Other than alopecia, which occurred in all patients, myelosuppression was the most common severe toxicity. However, grade 3 leukopenia occurred in only 19% of treatment courses, and grade 4 leukopenia (nadir < 1000/microL) occurred in only 2%. Nine patients required hospitalization for treatment of infection associated with neutropenia. No significant differences in toxicity were observed when the two paclitaxel regimens were compared. Although it is too early to assess the results adequately, preliminary findings showed that thus far 11 of 56 patients (20%) had a partial or complete response to therapy. Responses were observed in patients with breast, ovarian, and lung cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Paclitaxel can be safely administered in a 1-hour infusion in an outpatient setting, either as a single dose or in divided doses for three days. Severe hypersensitivity reactions did not occur in 162 treatment courses, and neutropenia was mild in most patients. Incorporation of this dose and these schedules of paclitaxel into combination chemotherapy regimens should be feasible. An investigation of higher paclitaxel doses given in a 1-hour infusion is currently in progress.",1
Does timing of adjuvant chemotherapy influence the prognosis after early breast cancer? Results of the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (DBCG).,"The purpose of this study was to examine the effect on survival of delaying the start of adjuvant chemotherapy for early breast cancer for up to 3 months after surgery. In the nation-wide clinical trials of the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group, 7501 breast cancer patients received chemotherapy within 3 months of surgery between 1977 and 1999: 352 with classical cyclofosfamide, metotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF); 6065 with CMF i.v. and 1084 with cyclofosfamide, epirubicin and 5-fluorouracil. For the analysis, the time between surgery and the start of chemotherapy was divided into four strata (1-3, 4, 5 and 6-13 weeks). The results show that within the three groups of chemotherapy, there was an even distribution of known prognostic factors across the four strata of initiation of chemotherapy. There was no pattern indicating a benefit from early start of chemotherapy. No significant interactions were found for subgroups of patients with a poorer prognosis (many involved lymph nodes, high-grade malignancies or hormone receptor negative disease). In conclusion, we have found no evidence for a survival benefit due to early initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy within the first 2-3 months after surgery.",0
Fulvestrant (Faslodex) versus anastrozole for the second-line treatment of advanced breast cancer in subgroups of postmenopausal women with visceral and non-visceral metastases: combined results from two multicentre trials.,"The efficacy of fulvestrant (Faslodex), a novel oestrogen receptor (ER) antagonist that downregulates the ER and has no known agonist effects, was compared with the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole (Arimidex) for the second-line treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women with visceral and non-visceral metastases. Assessment was by means of a retrospective subgroup analysis of combined data from two randomised, phase III trials. Objective response (OR) rates were similar in patients treated with fulvestrant and anastrozole, respectively (21.9% versus 19.3%-patients with no visceral metastases; 15.7% versus 13.2%-all of the patients with visceral metastases; 18.8% versus 14.0%-patients with visceral metastases only). The proportion of patients with clinical benefit (CB) was also similar between treatments and between subgroups with and without visceral disease. Fulvestrant is at least as effective as anastrozole, providing a valuable treatment option for advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women with visceral metastases who have failed on prior endocrine therapy.",0
Early prediction of response to chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer using sequential 18F-FDG PET.,"UNLABELLED: Chemotherapy is currently the treatment of choice for patients with high-risk metastatic breast cancer. Clinical response is determined after several cycles of chemotherapy by changes in tumor size as assessed by conventional imaging procedures including CT, MRI, plain film radiography, or ultrasound. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of sequential 18F-FDG PET to predict response after the first and second cycles of standardized chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer. METHODS: Eleven patients with 26 metastatic lesions underwent 31 (18)F-FDG PET examinations (240-400 MBq of 18F-FDG; 10-min 2-dimensional emission and transmission scans). Clinical response, as assessed by conventional imaging after completion of chemotherapy, served as the reference. 18F-FDG PET images after the first and second cycles of chemotherapy were analyzed semiquantitatively for each metastatic lesion using standardized uptake values (SUVs) normalized to patients' blood glucose levels. In addition, whole-body 18F-FDG PET images were viewed for overall changes in the 18F-FDG uptake pattern of metastatic lesions within individual patients and compared with conventional imaging results after the third and sixth cycles of chemotherapy. RESULTS: After completion of chemotherapy, 17 metastatic lesions responded, as assessed by conventional imaging procedures. In those lesions, SUV decreased to 72% +/- 21% after the first cycle and 54% +/- 16% after the second cycle, when compared with the baseline PET scan. In contrast, 18F-FDG uptake in lesions not responding to chemotherapy (n = 9) declined only to 94% +/- 19% after the first cycle and 79% +/- 9% after the second cycle. The differences between responding and nonresponding lesions were statistically significant after the first (P = 0.02) and second (P = 0.003) cycles. Visual analysis of 18F-FDG PET images correctly predicted the response in all patients as early as after the first cycle of chemotherapy. As assessed by 18F-FDG PET, the overall survival in nonresponders (n = 5) was 8.8 mo, compared with 19.2 mo in responders (n = 6). CONCLUSION: In patients with metastatic breast cancer, sequential 18F-FDG PET allowed prediction of response to treatment after the first cycle of chemotherapy. The use of 18F-FDG PET as a surrogate endpoint for monitoring therapy response offers improved patient care by individualizing treatment and avoiding ineffective chemotherapy.",0
Prediction of progressive disease using tumor markers in metastatic breast cancer patients without target lesions in first-line chemotherapy.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to develop a prediction model of progressive disease (PD) in breast cancer patients without measurable disease in first-line chemotherapy. METHODS: We developed a model to predict PD using carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen (CA) 15-3 in metastatic breast cancer patients who were enrolled in a phase III trial. The model was determined using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) calculated by the bootstrap method as internal validation. We verified the model for those who received first-line chemotherapy in a clinical setting as external validation. We categorized patients without measurable disease into PD and non-PD groups and compared the time to progression (TTP). RESULTS: The model consisted of percent changes in CEA and CA 15-3 levels from second to third chemotherapy course and baseline abnormality of them. The AUC after external validation was 0.90. Patients without measurable disease were categorized into PD (N = 10) and non-PD groups (N = 53) by the model. The difference in TTP between the two groups was statistically significant (hazard ratio, 0.437; P = 0.021). CONCLUSION: The model may be useful to determine PD in metastatic breast cancer patients without measurable disease.",0
"Molecular markers in the endometrium at baseline of postmenopausal patients with early breast cancer in the ATAC (Arimidex, tamoxifen, alone, or in combination) trial.","OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to assess baseline endometrial molecular events in the ATAC (Arimidex, tamoxifen, alone, or in combination) trial of breast cancer adjuvant therapy. STUDY DESIGN: Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) levels and markers of cell proliferation (Ki67) and apoptosis ( Bcl -2) were assessed in 93 patients at baseline. RESULTS: An inactive/atrophic endometrium was found in 63 patients, 5 had a proliferative endometrium, and 12 had a secretory endometrium. Thirteen endometrial polyps were analyzed. Inactive endometrium showed high levels of ER in the glandular epithelium, whereas in more than 50% of samples, PR expression was negative or low (+) in the glandular epithelium, and stroma. Ki67 expression was low in both the glandular epithelium and the stroma of the inactive endometrium, whereas Bcl -2 expression was mostly high or very high (+++/++++) in the glandular epithelium. Bcl -2 was strongly expressed (+++/++++) in the glandular epithelium of polyps. CONCLUSION: Although all patients were asymptomatic, some had endometrial pathology.",0
Phase I study of 5-fluorouracil with folinic acid combined with recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.,"A Phase I study was conducted to determine whether the addition of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) to a combined 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and folinic acid (FA) regimen would allow an escalated starting dose of 5-FU. FA (500 mg/m2) was administered as a 2-hour infusion on days 1 through 5, with 5-FU administered as a bolus injection 1 hour after the initiation of FA. Fifteen patients were enrolled in the trial; six were entered at a dose level of 375 mg/m2 of 5-FU, six at 450 mg/m2, and three at 540 mg/m2. rhGM-CSF was administered subcutaneously on days 6 through 15. A course of therapy was repeated every 28 days. Serious toxicity was observed at 450 mg/m2, with two patients developing grade 3 mucositis and one, grade 4 mucositis. Dose-limiting toxicity occurred at 540 mg/m2, at which point three patients developed grade 4 mucositis. One patient with metastatic colon cancer who received 5-FU at 540 mg/m2 achieved a partial response. Because of this persistent mucositis, the addition of rhGM-CSF used in this schedule would not allow an increased starting dose of 5-FU.",0
Optimization of chemotherapy administration for clinical 41.8 degrees C whole body hyperthermia.,"Preclinical data is consistent with the concept that the timing of chemotherapy during radiant heat-whole body hyperthermia (WBH) should affect therapeutic index. In order to test this hypothesis, a controlled clinical investigation was initiated. Patients received carboplatin (CBDCA) on an early or late schedule with respect to achieving target temperature (i.e. 41.8 degrees C) in alternating treatment cycles. The first cycle was randomized between patients regarding the early or late schedule for two planned sets per patient (i.e. four cycles). Ifosfamide, etoposide and granulocyte colony stimulating factor were delivered during all cycles with a standardized schedule. A total of 53 cycles involving 17 patients were analyzed. Detailed toxicity evaluation (i.e. delay in therapy secondary to thrombocytopenia, need for platelet transfusions, and days of hospitalization) taken collectively demonstrated a statistically and clinically significant advantage to delivering CBDCA 10 min after target temperature, during the plateau phase of WBH.",0
"Hematopoietic recovery following high-dose combined alkylating-agent chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow support in patients in phase-I clinical trials of colony-stimulating factors: G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-1, IL-2, M-CSF.","Hematopoietic recovery in 115 patients with metastatic breast cancer or metastatic melanoma, enrolled in phase-I studies of recombinant growth factors while undergoing treatment with high-dose chemotherapy with autologous bone marrow support, was examined with assays of bone marrow progenitor cells and peripheral blood progenitor cells, and by evaluation of peripheral blood counts. Groups of patients receiving hematopoietic cytokine support [with interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-2 (IL-2), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), or monocyte CSF (M-CSF)] post marrow infusion were compared with contemporaneous control patients not receiving growth factor support. Patients receiving GM-CSF demonstrated statistically significant increases in the growth of granulocyte/macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM) in the bone marrow and peripheral blood compared with control patients. The effect of GM-CSF was dose dependent in the early period post marrow infusion (day +6) with bone marrow CFU-GM colonies at doses 8-16 micrograms/kg/day 34 times those measured in controls. Significant increases in bone marrow multipotential progenitor cells (CFU-GEMM) were seen in patients receiving GM-CSF day +21 post marrow infusion. Patients receiving IL-1 demonstrated significant increases in bone marrow CFU-GM at day +21, maximal at dosages of 24-32 ng/kg/day. There were no significant increases in burst forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) among any study group. Patients receiving G-CSF had significantly increased absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) and total white blood cell counts (WBC) by day +11 post transplant compared with control patients. Patients receiving GM-CSF demonstrated significantly increased WBC (greater than 2000/mm3) at day +11 and ANC greater than 500/mm3 at day +16. Optimal dose of G-CSF and GM-CSF to stimulate neutrophil recovery post transplant was 4-8 micrograms/kg/day and 8-16 micrograms/kg/day, respectively. Platelet recovery did not differ among the six study groups. These data demonstrate accelerated myeloid recovery after high-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow support in patients receiving either G-CSF or GM-CSF. Moreover, GM-CSF and IL-1 stimulate myelopoiesis at the level of bone marrow CFU-GM, while G-CSF causes earlier neutrophil recovery peripherally.",0
Prognostic importance of occult axillary lymph node micrometastases from breast cancers. International (Ludwig) Breast Cancer Study Group.,"Serial sectioning of ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes judged to be disease-free after routine histological examination revealed micrometastases in 83 (9%) of 921 breast cancer subjects. These patients had a poorer disease-free (p = 0.003) and overall (p = 0.002) survival after 5 years' median follow-up than did patients whose nodes remained negative on serial sectioning. The presence of axillary lymph node micrometastases correlated with the presence of vascular invasion and tumour size (p less than 0.0001 and p = 0.02, respectively). The presence of occult micrometastases remained statistically significant after adjusting for other prognostic factors. The detection of these micrometastases in lymph nodes may identify a high risk ""node-negative"" population and should be considered as part of the routine pathology examination.",0
Zoledronic acid and survival in breast cancer patients with bone metastases and elevated markers of osteoclast activity.,"OBJECTIVE: Most breast cancer patients with bone metastases will receive bisphosphonate treatment. This post hoc analysis investigated whether early normalization of urinary N-telopeptide of type I collagen (NTX) levels during bisphosphonate therapy correlates with a long-term reduction in skeletal-related event (SRE) risk and mortality in patients with breast cancer. METHODS: This was a retrospective subset analysis of a phase III randomized trial comparing i.v. zoledronic acid with pamidronate treatment in patients with bone metastases from breast cancer or multiple myeloma. Patients with breast cancer who had NTX assessments at baseline and at months 1 and 3 (n = 342) were classified as normal (NTX < 64 nmol/mmol creatinine) or elevated (NTX > or = 64 nmol/mmol creatinine). The relative risk for an SRE or death was estimated with Cox regression models. RESULTS: Among the 328 evaluable patients treated with zoledronic acid, 196 patients (59.7%) had elevated baseline NTX, with 149 of those patients (76.0%) having normalized NTX levels and 31 patients (15.8%) having persistently elevated NTX levels at 3 months. The normalized NTX group had significantly lower risks for a first SRE, a first fracture or surgery to bone, or death than the group that had persistently elevated NTX levels. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that early normalization of elevated baseline NTX while receiving zoledronic acid is associated with longer event-free and overall survival times compared with persistently elevated NTX. Further analyses in cancer patients with elevated marker levels are warranted to confirm the implications of these findings.",0
Response and survival in advanced breast cancer after two non-cross-resistant combinations.,"A prospective study with two cytotoxic combinations (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF), and adriamycin plus vincristine (AV)) was carried out in 110 patients with advanced breast cancer. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups in the response rate after primary treatment, the median duration of response, and the median survival. In both groups responders survived for longer than non-responders. Secondary treatment after crossover for progression or relapse resulted in response rates of 35% for AV and 20% for CMF. Toxicity was mainly represented by reversible haemosuppression. These results are comparable with those obtained with other multiple-drug regimens, and combination chemotherapy alone seems to have reached a plateau in its capacity to control disseminated breast cancer.",1
Effect of cardiac dysfunction on treatment outcomes in women receiving trastuzumab for HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer.,"Trastuzumab improves time to disease progression (TTP) and survival when added to chemotherapy for HER-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC), but it is associated with infrequent cardiac dysfunction (CD). We analyzed data from a previous pivotal randomized trial of 469 women with HER2-overexpressing MBC. The aim was to determine the benefit of adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy in terms of TTP that was free of CD, including all CD, moderate or severe (New York Heart Association class III/IV) CD only, or moderate or severe CD that did not improve with cardiac therapy. We also assessed moderate or severe CD-free survival. We assessed the impact of trastuzumab for these indices on the entire cohort and on specific chemotherapy subsets. Median TTP or any CD improved when trastuzumab was added to all chemotherapy (4.6 months vs. 6.6 months with trastuzumab, P = 0.0001), an anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin) plus cyclophosphamide (AC; 6.0 months vs. 6.6 months, P = 0.24), and paclitaxel (2.8 months vs. 6.6 months, P = 0.0001). When defined as time to moderate or severe CD, median TTP improved when trastuzumab was added to all chemotherapy (4.6 months vs. 7.0 months, P = 0.0001), AC (6.0 months vs. 7.2 months, P = 0.02), and paclitaxel (2.8 months vs. 6.9 months, P = 0.0001). There was no statistical difference between moderate and severe CD-free survival with trastuzumab added to chemotherapy. Outcomes improved with trastuzumab despite CD. In particular, the benefit from trastuzumab/paclitaxel outweighed the potential risk of CD in patients with MBC. These types of analyses will be critical for trials assessing trastuzumab as adjuvant therapy.",0
Estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor as predictive biomarkers of response to endocrine therapy: a prospectively powered pathology study in the Tamoxifen and Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational trial.,"PURPOSE: The Tamoxifen and Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational (TEAM) trial included a prospectively planned pathology substudy testing the predictive value of progesterone receptor (PgR) expression for outcome of estrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive) early breast cancer treated with exemestane versus tamoxifen.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pathology blocks from 4,781 TEAM patients randomly assigned to exemestane versus tamoxifen followed by exemestane for 5 years of total therapy were collected centrally, and tissue microarrays were constructed from samples from 4,598 patients. Quantitative analysis of hormone receptors (ER and PgR) was performed by using image analysis and immunohistochemistry, and the results were linked to outcome data from the main TEAM trial and analyzed relative to disease-free survival and treatment.RESULTS: Of 4,325 eligible ER-positive patients, 23% were PgR-poor (Allred < 4) and 77% were PgR- rich (Allred ≥ 5). No treatment-by-marker effect for PgR was observed for exemestane versus tamoxifen (PgR-rich hazard ratio [HR], 0.83; 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.05; PgR-poor HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.61 to 1.19; P = .88 for interaction). Both PgR and ER expression were associated with patient prognosis in univariate (PgR HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.65; P < .001; ER HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.86; P = .002), and multivariate analyses (P < .001 and P = .001, respectively). A trend toward a treatment-by-marker effect for ER-rich patients was observed.CONCLUSION: Preferential exemestane versus tamoxifen treatment benefit was not predicted by PgR expression; conversely, patients with ER-rich tumors may derive additional benefit from exemestane. Quantitative analysis of ER and PgR expression provides highly significant information on risk of early relapse (within 1 to 3 years) during treatment.",0
"Urinary polyamine levels in cancer patients treated with D,L-alpha-difluoromethylornithine, an inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis.","The polyamine biosynthesis inhibitor D,L-alpha-Difluoromethylornithine hydrochloride monohydrate (DFMO) has cytostatic and cytotoxic effects against various human tumor cell lines in vitro. We measured levels of the polyamines putrescine and spermidine in the urine of cancer patients undergoing ""conventional"" chemotherapy in a two-arm randomized phase I-II study with and without additional DFMO administered orally at a dose of 1.7 g/sq.m. t.i.d. The study group included 38 patients with carcinoma of the breast, stomach, prostate, or female genital organs or metastatic carcinoma of unknown origin. A control group of 32 patients with similar malignancies received ""conventional"" chemotherapy without DFMO. Polyamine levels were determined periodically in the urine of all patients. In DFMO-treated patients, a significant decrease in putrescine and spermidine levels was observed after 3 weeks of DFMO therapy (the first time point evaluated) that usually persisted throughout the course of treatment. Significant differences in polyamine levels between DFMO-treated and control patients were observed for patients in remission. Less significant differences were noted, however, for patients with static or progressive disease between DFMO-treated and control groups. DFMO activity appears to be reflected by a long-term decrease in urinary polyamine levels.",0
"A comparison of cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, 5-fluorouracil (CAF) and cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, vincristine, prednisone (CMFVP) in patients with metastatic breast cancer: a Southeastern Cancer Study Group project.","In an ongoing prospective randomized study, 113 evaluable patients have received either a three-drug combination that included cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin and 5-fluorouracil (CAF) or a five-drug combination including cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, vincristine and prednisone (CMFVP) given intermittently 1 week out of 4. Responses (64%), median duration of response (32 weeks), and median duration of disease control (32 weeks) achieved with CAF were superior to those achieved with CMFVP (37%, 22 weeks, 17 weeks, respectively). Morbidity secondary to CAF was significant, with nausea and vomiting, malaise, total alopecia, and granulocytopenia being the main features.",1
Vinorelbine. A review of its pharmacological properties and clinical use in cancer chemotherapy.,"Vinorelbine is a semisynthetic vinca alkaloid with a broad spectrum of antitumour activity. The drug is effective as a single agent in inoperable/advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), producing objective response rates of about 15 to 30%, and as first-line or later chemotherapy for metastatic spread in advanced breast cancer. Combining vinorelbine with standard chemotherapeutic regimens improves response rates in these indications compared with vinorelbine monotherapy: in NSCLC response rates increase to 30 to 50% when vinorelbine is administered with cisplatin. Importantly, survival was prolonged by a further 9 weeks with this combination in a trial in > 600 patients with NSCLC. Comparative trials evaluating vinorelbine in women with advanced breast cancer are few at present. However, results suggest greater efficacy for vinorelbine than for melphalan as second-line chemotherapy, and similar efficacy for vinorelbine plus doxorubicin compared with doxorubicin plus 2 other drugs as first-line chemotherapy. Vinorelbine has tended to yield superior response rates when compared with vindesine, and appears to have greater haematological toxicity (i.e. granulocytopenia) but less neurological toxicity (peripheral neuropathy, constipation, loss of deep tendon reflexes) than this agent. Myelosuppression is the most frequent cause of vinorelbine treatment delay or dose reduction. Other consequences of vinorelbine therapy are those typically seen with antineoplastic agents, such as diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, and alopecia. However, these are rarely severe. Early clinical investigations indicate that the antitumour effects of vinorelbine in other malignancies including ovarian carcinoma, lymphoma and head and neck cancer warrant further exploration, as does the efficacy of the drug relative to standard approaches and its possible beneficial effects on quality of life of cancer patients. Clarification is also required of the feasibility of an oral dosage form, which in preliminary investigations has shown some efficacy in NSCLC, but a variable response rate and high incidence of gastrointestinal disturbances in women with breast cancer. Thus, vinorelbine as a single agent or combined palliative therapy is effective against advanced NSCLC, and as first- or second-line chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer. This semisynthetic vinca alkaloid has a manageable tolerability profile and potential for use in other malignancies and as an oral formulation. With these attributes, vinorelbine is a valuable option which extends the range of treatments available for these difficult-to-treat malignancies.",0
Mycophenolic acid for psoriasis.,"Mycophenolic acid is an antimetabolite used experimentally for the treatment of psoriasis. Thirty-eight patients were treated with mycophenolic acid. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study demonstrated the efficacy of mycophenolic acid (P less than .01). A long-term safety study showed the occurrence of hematologic abnormalities, viral infections, and carcinoma. The position of mycophenolic acid in the therapeutic treatment of psoriasis must await the results of a multicenter cooperative study.",0
Local therapy of invasive disease.,"Mastectomy and CS and RT are currently the two major options for patients with early breast cancer. Prospective randomized trials have shown comparable survival rates for these two treatments. The major selection criterion for CS and RT is the relative size of the tumor and the breast. The surgeon must be able to resect the tumor and still preserve a good cosmetic appearance. In most cases, an axillary dissection is also performed and RT is delivered to the breast alone. With good surgical and radiotherapeutic technique, good to excellent cosmetic results are generally obtained, and complications are uncommon.",0
Axillary lymph node count is lower after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.,"BACKGROUND: Retrieval of fewer than 10 lymph nodes at axillary dissection (ALND) for breast cancer can represent anatomic variation or inadequate dissection. We postulated that despite aggressive ALND, a lower lymph node count is more frequent after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS: Patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by ALND were compared with patients who received surgery first. All patients received a level I and II ALND at a single institution by one of the breast surgeons. The number of nodes retrieved at ALND was dichotomized into categories (< 10 and > or = 10), and compared using Fisher exact test. RESULTS: A total of 143 neoadjuvant and 170 surgery-first patients were studied. Patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy were significantly more likely to have fewer than 10 lymph nodes retrieved at ALND than were the surgery-first patients (19/143 or 13% vs. 6/170 or 4%, P = .003). CONCLUSIONS: A low lymph node count is more common in patients after treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and should not be assumed to represent an incomplete ALND.",0

Weekly nab-paclitaxel is safe and effective in ≥65 years old patients with metastatic breast cancer: a post-hoc analysis.,"PURPOSE: This post-hoc analysis of 2 studies investigated the safety and efficacy of weekly and every-3-week (q3w) nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) in older patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) compared with q3w solvent-based paclitaxel and docetaxel. RESULTS: Patients≥65 years (median: 69) were analyzed. In phase 2 (n=52), overall response rates (ORR) for weekly nab-paclitaxel were 60-64% vs 22% for q3w nab-paclitaxel and 32% for docetaxel. In phase 3 (n=62), ORRs were 27% for q3w nab-paclitaxel and 19% for solvent-based paclitaxel. In phase 2, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 18.9 months for 150 mg/m2 weekly nab-paclitaxel vs 8.5-13.8 months for all other regimens. In phase 3, median PFS for q3w nab-paclitaxel and solvent-based paclitaxel were 5.6 months and 3.5 months, respectively. Weekly nab-paclitaxel resulted in less serious adverse events compared with all other regimens. CONCLUSIONS: Weekly nab-paclitaxel was safe and more efficacious compared with the q3w schedule and with solvent-based taxanes in older patients with MBC.",0
Do topical anesthetics reduce periareolar injectional pain before sentinel lymph node biopsy?,"BACKGROUND: Topical anesthetics have been used in various procedures. The purpose of this study was to evaluate efficacy of lidocaine/prilocaine cream in decreasing the pain of injection for sentinel lymph node biopsy. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted on female breast cancer patients undergoing periareolar injection for sentinel lymph node isolation. Subjects applied lidocaine/prilocaine cream or a placebo cream before injection and completed a survey postoperatively. RESULTS: Twenty treatment and 19 control patients were studied. There was a trend for control subjects to indicate that the injection was ""painful"" or ""extremely painful"" more often than treatment subjects (52.6% vs 25.0%, respectively, P = .074). The treatment group was more likely to recommend the cream to other cancer patients (70.0% vs 42.1%), with a trend toward significance (P = .076). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed no statistically significant reduction in pain scores in subjects receiving the topical anesthetic. Further studies targeting patients with low pain tolerance may prove more effective.",0
Long-term follow-up of the Stockholm randomized trials of postoperative radiation therapy versus adjuvant chemotherapy among 'high risk' pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer patients.,"For many years, loco-regional radiotherapy was the standard postoperative treatment for node positive breast cancer patients in Sweden. Because of encouraging results from trials of adjuvant chemotherapy in the mid 1970s, the Stockholm Breast Cancer Study Group decided to directly compare postoperative radiation (RT) with adjuvant CMF-type chemotherapy (CT). Long-term results are presented from two randomized trials of RT versus CT in pre- (n = 547) and postmenopausal (n = 679) patients, respectively, with node positive disease or a tumour diameter > 30 mm. RT substantially reduced loco-regional recurrences among both pre- and postmenopausal patients (relative hazard RT versus CT: 0.67 and 0.43, respectively). Among premenopausal patients distant metastases occurred less frequently in the CT group (relative hazard: 1.68, p > 0.001) resulting in an improved recurrence-free survival (p = 0.04). Overall survival was also better with CT (cumulative survival at 15 years: 50% and 44% in the CT and RT groups, respectively) but the difference was not statistically significant. Among the postmenopausal patients there were no substantial differences in terms of recurrence-free or overall survival between the treatment groups. The risk of a second primary malignancy, however, was doubled in the RT group (p > 0.01). The most pronounced excess concerned second lung cancers occurring after 10 years. The cumulative incidence at 20 years was estimated at 0.3% and 3.7% in the CT and RT groups, respectively. The trials illustrate the role of radiotherapy in preventing loco-regional recurrences among high-risk patients, as well as the need for systemic treatment to control the disease systemically.",0
A comparison of misonidazole sensitized radiation therapy to radiation therapy alone for the palliation of hepatic metastases: results of a Radiation Therapy Oncology Group randomized prospective trial.,"Between May 1980 and July 1983, the RTOG conducted a randomized prospective study comparing external radiation therapy and misonidazole to radiation therapy alone for patients with hepatic metastases. Two hundred fourteen patients were accessioned to this study of whom 187 were evaluable. Radiation therapy was delivered to the whole liver to a dose of 21.0 Gy in 7 fractions. Misonidazole was administered orally, 1.5 gm/m2 daily 4-6 hr before each treatment. Patients in the two treatment groups were evenly distributed with respect to stratification variables including primary site, extent of metastatic disease, and Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS). End points examined included amelioration of hepatic pain, improvement of KPS and alkaline phosphatase, decrease in liver and tumor size, and survival. The addition of misonidazole did not significantly improve the therapeutic response to radiation therapy in any of the parameters studied. Hepatic irradiation was effective in relieving abdominal pain with 80% of the symptomatic patients achieving improvement following therapy. Pain was completely relieved in 54% of these patients. Patients with liver metastases from colon carcinoma improved more frequently than those with metastases from other primary tumor sites (p = 0.02). Relief of pain occurred more frequently in patients treated with radiation therapy and misonidazole (87%) compared with radiation therapy alone (74%) (p = 0.08). Palliation of pain was prompt, occurring within a median of 1.7 weeks from the initiation of treatment, and 94% of patients who improved did so within 6 weeks of treatment. The median duration of response was 13.0 weeks in the symptomatic patients; 52% of those surviving 3 months remained improved. KPS improved in 28% of patients. Serial CT scans revealed a partial response in 7% and a marginal response in 13% of patients. One patient had a complete response to treatment. The median survival of patients treated in this series was 4.2 months with no difference between the two treatment groups. Patients with metastases from colon carcinoma and an initial KPS of 80 or more (48% of the patient population) had a median survival of 5.8 months with radiation therapy alone compared with 6.6 months with radiation therapy and misonidazole (p = 0.36). There was no significant treatment related morbidity. Radiation therapy remains an excellent palliative tool for the management of patients with symptomatic hepatic metastases. Further research must continue to identify new methods of selectivity enhancing the tumor response to radiation therapy.",0
The effect of seated exercise on fatigue and quality of life in women with advanced breast cancer.,"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects of a seated exercise program on fatigue and quality of life (QOL) in women with metastatic breast cancer. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled, longitudinal trial. SETTING: Outpatient clinic of a comprehensive cancer center. SAMPLE: Convenience sample of 38 women who were beginning outpatient chemotherapy. METHODS: Subjects were randomized to a control or intervention group; the intervention was performance of a seated exercise program using home videotape three times per week for four cycles of chemotherapy. All subjects completed the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Version IV (FACIT F) at baseline and at the time of the next three cycles. Subjects were asked to document the frequency, duration, and intensity of all exercise participation on monthly calendars. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Exercise, fatigue, and QOL. FINDINGS: 32 subjects, 16 per group, completed the study follow-up. With a mixed modeling approach, total FACIT F scores for the entire sample declined at a significant rate (p = 0.003) beginning with cycle 3 but at a slower rate for the experimental group (p = 0.02). Fatigue scores indicated less increase and physical well-being subscale scores showed less decline for the experimental group (p = 0.008 and p = 0.02, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Women with advanced breast cancer randomized to the seated exercise intervention had a slower decline in total and physical well-being and less increase in fatigue scores starting with the third cycle of chemotherapy. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Seated exercise may be a feasible exercise program for women with advanced cancer for controlling fatigue and improving physical well-being.",0
Phase III study comparing exemestane with tamoxifen as first-line hormonal treatment of metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women: the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Breast Cancer Cooperative Group.,"PURPOSE: This phase III randomized open-label clinical trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the steroidal aromatase inactivator exemestane versus the antiestrogen tamoxifen as first-line treatment for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in postmenopausal women.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was conducted at 81 centers and enrolled postmenopausal patients with measurable hormone-sensitive metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer. Prior adjuvant chemotherapy and/or tamoxifen were allowed. One previous chemotherapy regimen and no prior hormone therapy for advanced disease were permitted. Patients were randomly assigned to receive exemestane 25 mg or tamoxifen 20 mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred.RESULTS: A total of 371 patients enrolled at 79 sites (182 exemestane, 189 tamoxifen) were included in the analysis. Both treatments were generally well tolerated without major toxicity. Overall response rate was greater for exemestane than for tamoxifen treatment (46% v 31%; odds ratio = 1.85; 95% CI, 1.21 to 2.82; P = .005). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was longer with exemestane (9.9 months; 95% CI, 8.7 to 11.8 months) than with tamoxifen (5.8 months; 95% CI, 5.3 to 8.1 months). However, these early differences (Wilcoxon P = .028) did not translate to a longer-term benefit in PFS, the primary study end point (log-rank P = .121). There was also no difference in survival between both study arms.CONCLUSION: Exemestane is an effective and well-tolerated first-line hormonal treatment for postmenopausal women with MBC and offers significant early improvement in time to tumor progression when compared with tamoxifen.",1
Sulindac and sulindac metabolites in nipple aspirate fluid and effect on drug targets in a phase I trial.,"Regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) has been associated with reduced risk of breast cancer. Sulindac, a nonselective NSAID with both cyclooxygenase-2-dependent and -independent activities, is a candidate for breast chemoprevention. We conducted a phase Ib trial in 30 women at increased risk for breast cancer to evaluate the breast tissue distribution of sulindac at two dose levels (150 mg daily and 150 mg twice daily for 6 weeks), using nipple aspirate fluid (NAF) as a surrogate of breast tissue drug exposure. We also explored the effect of sulindac on drug-induced biomarkers in NAF. We show that sulindac and its metabolites partition to human breast as measured by NAF levels. Sulindac intervention did not decrease 13,14-dihydro-15-keto prostaglandin A(2), a stable derivative of prostaglandin E(2), in NAF, but exposure was associated with a significant trend towards higher levels of growth differentiation factor 15 in NAF in women receiving 150 mg twice daily (P = 0.038). These results are the first to show partitioning of sulindac and metabolites to human breast tissue and the first evidence for a potential dose-dependent effect of sulindac on growth differentiation factor 15 levels in NAF.",0
"The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group experience with cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, and 5-fluorouracil (CAF) in patients with metastatic breast cancer.","Data on 162 women (90 premenopausal and 72 postmenopausal) with metastatic breast cancer randomized to receive cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin (doxorubicin) and 5-fluorouracil (CAF) on two Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) protocols were analyzed. Twenty-three percent had complete remission; 39% had partial remission; 28% had no change; and 3% had disease progression. Of those patients in whom receptors were known, response rates were 65% for estrogen (ER)-receptor positive and 70% for ER-negative patients. The median duration of response was 11.4 months. The median survival time from the start of CAF was 20.2 months. The response rate, time to treatment failure (TTF), and median survival time were superior in the premenopausal women. These differences ceased, however, to be statistically significant in logistic models. Factors significantly associated with longer TTF and longer survival were as follows: one or two organs with metastases (TTF, P less than 0.0001; survival, P less than 0.0001); dominant site other than soft tissue (TTF, P less than 0.0001; survival, P = 0.05); and an initial good performance status (TTF, P = 0.007; survival, P = 0.02). Patients with ER-positive disease had a significantly longer median survival time (P = 0.003).",0
Phase I multicenter trial of interleukin 6 therapy after autologous bone marrow transplantation in advanced breast cancer.,"Our purpose was to determine the maximum tolerated dosage of rhIL-6 after high-dose cytotoxic chemotherapy and autologous BMT in patients with advanced breast cancer. Twenty patients (median age 43.5 years) received either CY and thiotepa (n = 3) or CY, thiotepa and carboplatin (n = 17) for 4 days. Unpurged autologous BM was reinfused 72 h later. Daily rhIL-6 therapy began the day of marrow infusion and continued until recovery of neutrophils (> or = 1.5 x 10(9)/l) and platelets (> or = 50 x 10(9)/l) or for a maximum of 28 days at a dosage of 0.3 microgram/kg/day (n = 7), 1 microgram/kg/day (n = 6) or 3 micrograms/kg/day (n = 7). Two of the initial 4 patients given rhIL-6 at 0.3 mu/kg i.v. experienced grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia, so subsequent patients received s.c. rhIL-6. Most toxicities attributable to rhIL-6 were reversible or mild constitutional symptoms, but dose-limiting grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia also occurred in 3 of the 7 patients receiving the 3 micrograms/kg dose. At the 0.3 and 1 microgram/kg/day doses, 8 of 13 patients completed the study vs. only 2 of 7 at the 3 micrograms/kg/day dose. During rhIL-6 treatment, neutrophil recovery (> or = 500 x 10(6)/l) occurred in 12 patients and platelet recovery (> or = 20 x 10(9)/l) occurred in 6 patients, 5 of whom received the 0.3 or 1 microgram/kg/day s.c. dose. The maximal tolerated dose of rhIL-6 after autologous BMT appeared to be 1 microgram/kg/day s.c., a dose appreciably lower than the maximal tolerated dose after conventional cytotoxic therapy.",0
Effect of preoperative short course famotidine on TILs and survival in breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Histamine receptor antagonists have been shown to induce tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in colonic cancers and improve survival. The role of histamine receptor anatagonists in breast cancer is unclarified. AIM: To evaluate the role of histamine receptor antagonists in inducing (TILs) in breast cancer. METHOD: Forty-five patients with operable breast cancers (25 cases who received preoperative famotidine and 20 controls) were studied for the effect of famotidine in inducing TILs and survival in breast cancer. RESULTS: Significant TILs were seen in 75% (18/24) of cases as opposed to 35% (7/20) controls. In logistic regression analysis the only variable found to be predictive of TILs was famotidine, odds ratio 7.324 (1.693-31.686) P=0.008. In Cox's regression presence of TILs was favorably associated with improved disease free survival at a median follow up of 35.56 months. The hazard ratio for disease relapse was 3.327 (1.174-9.426) P=0.024 in TIL negative as compared to TIL positive patients. Famotidine use alone was not significant in the original model, however, on incorporation of quadrant of involvement in addition to other established prognostic factors in the above multivariate model, it assumed borderline significance with a hazard ratio for disease free survival 3.404 (1.005-11.531, P=0.049). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative short course famotidine induces TILs in breast cancer. Patients with TILs demonstrable in tumor specimens had an improved disease free survival. Famotidine may improve disease free survival in breast cancer and these findings need validation in larger population subsets.",0
Multifactorial approach to predicting resistance to anthracyclines.,"PURPOSE: Validated biomarkers predictive of response/resistance to anthracyclines in breast cancer are currently lacking. The neoadjuvant Trial of Principle (TOP) study, in which patients with estrogen receptor (ER) -negative tumors were treated with anthracycline (epirubicin) monotherapy, was specifically designed to evaluate the predictive value of topoisomerase II-α (TOP2A) and develop a gene expression signature to identify those patients who do not benefit from anthracyclines.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The TOP trial included 149 patients, 139 of whom were evaluable for response prediction analyses. The primary end point was pathologic complete response (pCR). TOP2A and gene expression profiles were evaluated using pre-epirubicin biopsies. Gene expression data from ER-negative samples of the EORTC (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer) 10994/BIG (Breast International Group) 00-01 and MDACC (MD Anderson Cancer Center) 2003-0321 neoadjuvant trials were used for validation purposes.RESULTS: A pCR was obtained in 14% of the evaluable patients in the TOP trial. TOP2A amplification, but not protein overexpression, was significantly associated with pCR (P ≤ .001 v P ≤ .33). We developed an anthracycline-based score (A-Score) combining three signatures: a TOP2A gene signature and two previously published signatures related to tumor invasion and immune response. The A-Score was characterized by a high negative predictive value ([NPV]; NPV, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.90 to 1.00) overall and in the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -negative and HER2-positive subpopulations. Its performance was independently confirmed in the anthracycline-based arms of the two validation trials (BIG 00-01: NPV, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.94 and MDACC 2003-0321: NPV, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.00).CONCLUSION: Given its high NPV, the A-Score could become, if further validated, a useful clinical tool to identify those patients who do not benefit from anthracyclines and could therefore be spared the non-negligible adverse effects.",0
"Randomized trial of cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and fluorouracil chemotherapy compared with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil with node-positive breast cancer in Japan.","BACKGROUND: To compare the cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) chemotherapy and the anthracycline-containing regimen cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and fluorouracil (CEF) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the latter. METHODS: A total of 294 patients with axillary node-positive primary breast cancer of STAGE I-IIIa were randomly assigned to either CEF [cyclophosphamide (CPA) 500 mg/m(2) i.v. days 1 and 8; epirubicin (EPI) 60 mg/m(2) i.v. day 1; and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 500 mg/m(2) i.v. days 1 and 8] or CMF [CPA 500 mg/m(2) i.v. days 1 and 8; methotrexate (MTX) 40 mg/m(2) i.v. days 1 and 8; and 5-FU 500 mg/m(2) i.v. days 1 and 8]. Both treatment regimens were comprised of six cycles at 4-week intervals. Tamoxifen (TAM) 20 mg/day was concomitantly given to estrogen receptor (ER)-positive patients and those with undetermined ER status for 2 years. RESULTS: The overall 5-year survival was 77.1% for CEF and 71.4% for CMF [p = 0.24; hazard ratio 0.79 (95% CI 0.50-1.24)], and the 5-year disease-free survival was 55.7% for CEF and 48.9% for CMF [p = 0.15; hazard ratio 0.80 (95% CI 0.57-1.12)]. Although the log-rank test did not show a significant difference, both overall and disease-free survivals were higher for CEF according to the point estimates. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) occurred more frequently in CEF. CONCLUSION: Whereas CEF had a good trend compare with CMF, it could not be proven statistically significant. The principal cause of the failure seems to be insufficient power, that is, the dose intensity (EPI: 60 mg/m(2)) set 10 years ago, when the trial began, was low, and the number of trial subjects was small because of the background of the times, which made the accumulation of cases extremely difficult. However, the trial should be considered to be meaningful, as it was the first, formally conducted controlled trial on chemotherapy in Japan.",1
Radioimmunoguided surgery after primary treatment of locally advanced breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: To assess the role of radioimmunoguided surgery (RIGS) using a handheld intraoperative gamma-detecting probe (GDP) to identify neoplastic disease after primary chemotherapy in locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) patients injected with iodine 125-labeled monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients with histologically documented LABC were treated with a combined modality approach. After three courses of primary chemotherapy and before modified radical mastectomy, the 125I-radiolabeled MAbs B72.3 (anti-TAG72) and FO23C5 (anti-carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA]) were administered to 11 patients (group A) and 10 patients (group B), respectively. At surgery, a GDP was used to locate the primary tumor and to assess possible tumor multicentricity and the presence of ipsilateral axillary metastases. Routine pathologic examination was performed in neoplastic and normal tissue specimens of all 21 patients. In addition, immunohistochemical assay for TAG72 and CEA expression was performed. RESULTS: In group A patients, RIGS identified primary tumor in seven of 11 patients (63.3%) and unpalpable multicentric tumor lesions were located in two of four (50%). Positive axillary lymph nodes were histologically documented in eight of 11 patients (72.7%) and RIGS identified three of eight (37.5%). In group B, RIGS located the primary tumor lesion in four of 10 patients (40%); in two cases, the tumor was not clinically evident. Multicentricity was observed in one of two patients and lymph node involvement in three of nine (33.3%). No false-positive results were observed in either group A or B. CONCLUSION: RIGS appears to be a safe and reliable technique. However, the MAbs used in this study are not sufficiently specific. RIGS represents a technique for which the full potential for intraoperative assessment of breast cancer lesions can be reached when more specific antibodies become readily available.",0
Epirubicin versus mitoxantrone in combination chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer.,"As valid therapeutic alternatives to adriamycin, with a more favourable safety profile, epirubicin (E) and novantrone (N) were compared in combination with fluorouracil (F) and cyclophosphamide (C) in a prospective randomized clinical trial as first-line treatment for metastatic breast cancer (mbc). 158 women with mbc were randomly allocated to receive FEC or FNC regimen; the dosage in mg/m2 was as follows: 500 for C and F, 75 for E and 10 for N. All drugs were administered iv. on day 1 and recycled on day 21. In 141 evaluable patients the response rate (CR+PR) was better in the FEC (43.6%) than in the FNC regimen (30.3%) (95% C.I. of 32% to 55% versus 14% to 34%), without any statistically significant difference. Differences in response rate were significantly in favour of FEC group in previously untreated patients (57.6% versus 25%, p = .02), and in postmenopausal women (46.1% versus 23.6%, p = .01). No significant differences between the two treatment arms were observed in terms of either time to progression or duration of response and survival. The most important dose-limiting toxicity was hematological (leuko-and thrombocytopenia were significantly higher in FNC-treated patients). This difference in hematological toxicity sustained a significantly different incidence of delays in administering chemotherapy courses, which precluded the administration of comparable doses of all drugs in both groups. The incidence of complete alopecia was significantly higher in FEC-treated patients, while no clinical or instrumental evidence of CHF was observed with either regimen. Due to its more favourable therapeutic profile, the E-containing regimen seems a suitable first-line treatment for previously untreated patients with mbc, while the FNC combination should be offered to women refusing hair loss.",1
Locally advanced primary breast cancer: medium-term results of a randomised trial of multimodal therapy versus initial hormone therapy.,"We report the medium-term (median follow-up=52 months) results of a prospective randomised trial of multimodal therapy (neoadjuvant chemotherapy, Patey mastectomy, postoperative radiotherapy and adjuvant hormone therapy) (n=56) versus initial hormone therapy (n=52) for locally advanced primary breast cancer. Compared with multimodal therapy, initial hormone therapy was associated with reduced number of therapies for disease control (mean=3.6 versus 4.9) and mastectomy rate (31%). Multimodal therapy conferred better initial locoregional control and a longer disease-free interval. Nevertheless, there was no statistically significant differences in the rates of survival, metastasis and uncontrolled locoregional disease, as well as in the time to metastasis between the two therapy groups. Regardless of the therapy groups, oestrogen receptor positivity conferred a lower metastasis rate, better survival and locoregional control. Thus, initial hormone therapy may be a reasonable option for managing locally advanced primary breast cancer, especially for oestrogen receptor-positive tumours.",0
"A double-blind, randomised, vehicle-controlled clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of MAS065D in limiting the effects of radiation on the skin: interim analysis.","Our aim was to assess the efficacy of MAS065D, a non-steroidal water-in-oil cream, in preventing and limiting skin reactions caused by radiation therapy (RT). 40 women treated with conservative breast cancer surgery followed by radiotherapy, were randomised to receive MAS065D (22 pts) or vehicle (18 pts). Radiotherapy was delivered in 20 fractions: 2.25 Gy to the whole breast plus a concomitant boost of 0.25 Gy to the tumour bed up to a total dose of 50 Gy. Evaluations of skin toxicity, erythema, and subjective symptoms were carried out weekly and 3 weeks after treatment completion. A statistically significant difference between vehicle and MAS065D groups was recorded regarding the maximum severity of skin toxicity (p < 0.0001), burning within the radiation field (p = 0.039) and desquamation (p = 0.02), in favour of the latter. We conclude that MAS065D may be considered a safe and effective treatment in the prevention and minimization of skin reactions and associated symptoms.",0
Predictive value of serum medroxyprogesterone acetate concentration for response in advanced or recurrent breast cancer.,"Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs for endocrine therapy of metastatic breast cancer. In this study, the serum MPA concentration was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and evaluated for its usefulness in predicting the response in 79 cases of advanced or recurrent breast cancers. Overall, 29 patients (37%) achieved an objective response. The response rate correlated significantly with the oestrogen receptor (ER) status (P = 0.03), proliferative activity determined by DNA polymerase alpha (P = 0.04), the disease-free interval (DFI) (P = 0.05) and the serum MPA concentration (P < 0.001). Patients with ER-positive tumours, lower proliferative activity, a longer (DFI) or a higher serum MPA concentration responded more frequently. The mean serum MPA concentration in the responders with ER-positive tumours (P = 0.01) or tumours with a lower proliferative activity (P = 0.008) were significantly lower than in cases with ER-negative tumours or tumours with a higher proliferative activity, respectively. Cases with soft tissue metastases showed responses at significantly lower MPA concentrations (P = 0.003) than those with bone or visceral metastases. Furthermore, there was a dramatic decrease in the MPA concentration when a responder with a high concentration became unresponsive to the therapy. Thus, the serum MPA concentration is a determining factor for the response to treatment.",0
"Disease-free survival advantage of weekly epirubicin plus tamoxifen versus tamoxifen alone as adjuvant treatment of operable, node-positive, elderly breast cancer patients: 6-year follow-up results of the French adjuvant study group 08 trial.","PURPOSE: To assess whether an epirubicin (EPI) -based chemotherapy plus hormonal regimen improves disease-free (DFS) in women older than 65 years, with node-positive, operable breast cancer (BC), relative to tamoxifen (TAM) alone. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 338 patients were randomly assigned after surgery to receive TAM 30 mg/d for 3 years (TAM, n = 164), or EPI 30 mg on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days for six cycles plus TAM 30 mg/d for 3 years (EPI-TAM, n = 174). In both arms, patients received radiotherapy, delivered after chemotherapy (CT) in the EPI-TAM group. RESULTS: The 6-year DFS rates were 69.3% with TAM and 72.6% with EPI-TAM (P = .14). The multivariate analysis shows a relative risk of relapse of 1.93 (95% CI, 1.70 to 2.17) with TAM compared with EPI-TAM (P = .005). The 6-year OS, related to disease progression, was 79.1% and 79.8%, respectively (P = .41). Compliance with CT was good: 96.9% of patients received six cycles. The acute toxicity per patient was mild: grade 2 neutropenia in 5.9%, grade 2 anemia in 2.0%, grade 3 nausea or vomiting in 4.6%, and grade 3 alopecia in 7.2%. Five cases (in five patients) of decreased left ventricular ejection fraction occurred after CT: three after adjuvant CT, and two after anthracycline-based CT for relapse. One patient died as a result of dysrhythmia related to carcinomatous lymphangitis. No secondary leukemia occurred. CONCLUSION: This study conducted in node-positive elderly patients demonstrates a significant contribution of a weekly EPI regimen in terms of DFS. Moreover, this regimen is safe for hematologic, nonhematologic, and cardiac toxicities.",0
HESA-A: new treatment for breast cancer and choroidal metastasis.,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is one of the main causes of mortality among women worldwide. This type of cancer metastasizes to different body tissues, giving rise to many problems. The effect of HESA-A, a drug of herbal-marine origin, on vision, quality of life, and survival of end-stage breast cancer patients was investigated in this study. MATERIAL/METHODS: In a double-blind study, 24 breast cancer patients with choroidal metastasis, aged between 41 and 49 years, were divided into case and control groups, treated with 50 mg/kg/day of HESA-A and placebo, respectively. The patients were evaluated in respect to the intensity of experienced pain, by assessing their rate of narcotic analgesic use. The patients' vision scale was also evaluated. RESULTS: Notable improvement was seen in the vision of patients treated with HESA-A. Patients receiving HESA-A used narcotics at lower doses, owing to reduced experience of pain. No changes were observed in the vision of control group patients, or their pain experience. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of natural compounds with antioxidant and anticancer properties have been emphasized by different studies. HESA-A is a compound of natural origin, consisting of rare elements and organic materials, which in several animal and cellular studies has shown powerful anticancer effects and less toxicity on normal cells. The results of this study showed considerable improvement in the vision of breast cancer patients treated with HESA-A.",0
Comparative study of the acute nephrotoxicity from standard dose cisplatin +/- ifosfamide and high-dose chemotherapy with carboplatin and ifosfamide.,"The nephrotoxic effects of different platinum compounds based combination chemotherapies were compared. Chemotherapy consisted of either cisplatin fractionated over 5 days (5 x 20 mg/m2) or given as a single-day infusion (1 x 50 mg/m2) plus ifosfamide (4 g/m2) or high-dose chemotherapy was applied including carboplatin (3 x 500 mg/m2) and ifosfamide (3 x 4 g/m2) fractionated over three consecutive days. Conventional parameters such as serum creatinine and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), as well as urinary protein excretion of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG)) and alpha 1-micro-globulin were assessed in 52 patients. Fractionation over 5 days without adding other nephrotoxic agents, i.e. ifosfamide, prevented decreases in GFR following cisplatin, whereas the combination of conventional dose cisplatin and ifosfamide, given as a single-day infusion, and high-dose carboplatin/ifosfamide yielded a pronounced fall of GFR. All groups showed increases in the urinary excretion levels of serum derived proteins and NAG, but with significant differences; about 2 to 3-fold for 5-days cisplatin, 3 to 5-fold for single-day cisplatin/ifosfamide, and 20 to 35-fold for high-dose chemotherapy. Thus, conventional approaches can reduce but not prevent the nephrotoxicity of cisplatin-based chemotherapy. In particular, high-dose chemotherapy regimens including carboplatin and ifosfamide are associated with comparable or even higher nephrotoxicity to single-day cisplatin/ifosfamide. In the light of the long-term consequences of persistent renal damage prevention of nephrotoxicity should be further improved.",0
Virtual reality: a distraction intervention for chemotherapy.,"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To explore virtual reality (VR) as a distraction intervention to relieve symptom distress in adults receiving chemotherapy treatments for breast, colon, and lung cancer. DESIGN: Crossover design in which participants served as their own control. SETTING: Outpatient clinic at a comprehensive cancer center in the southeastern United States. SAMPLE: 123 adults receiving initial chemotherapy treatments. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to receive the VR distraction intervention during one chemotherapy treatment and then received no intervention (control) during an alternate matched chemotherapy treatment. The Adapted Symptom Distress Scale-2, Revised Piper Fatigue Scale, and State Anxiety Inventory were used to measure symptom distress. The Presence Questionnaire and an open-ended questionnaire were used to evaluate the subjects' VR experience. The influence of type of cancer, age, and gender on symptom outcomes was explored. Mixed models were used to test for differences in levels of symptom distress. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Virtual reality and symptom distress. FINDINGS: Patients had an altered perception of time (p < 0.001) when using VR, which validates the distracting capacity of the intervention. Evaluation of the intervention indicated that patients believed the head-mounted device was easy to use, they experienced no cyber-sickness, and 82% would use VR again. However, analysis demonstrated no significant differences in symptom distress immediately or two days following chemotherapy treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Patients stated that using VR made the treatment seem shorter and that chemotherapy treatments with VR were better than treatments without the distraction intervention. However, positive experiences did not result in a decrease in symptom distress. The findings support the idea that using VR can help to make chemotherapy treatments more tolerable, but clinicians should not assume that use of VR will improve chemotherapy-related symptoms. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Patients found using VR during chemotherapy treatments to be enjoyable. VR is a feasible and cost-effective distraction intervention to implement in the clinical setting.",0
Pulmonary toxicity of induction chemotherapy prior to standard or high-dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic support.,"We closely followed the pulmonary function of 150 consecutive high-risk breast cancer patients who underwent standard induction CAF (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil) chemotherapy, followed by randomization to either standard-dose CPB (cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, bischloroethylnitrosourea [BCNU]) chemotherapy (SDC) or to high-dose CPB chemotherapy (HDC) with autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) and peripheral blood progenitor cell support (PBPCS). Previously, we have described a delayed pulmonary toxicity syndrome (DPTS) which characterizes the pulmonary dysfunction after HDC and ABMT in this patient population. However, little is known concerning the role induction chemotherapy plays in its development. We found that after three cycles of induction CAF, the mean diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DL(CO)) significantly decreased by 12.6%. Additionally, in patients receiving HDC, the mean DL(CO) further decreased to a nadir of 55.2 +/- 14.1% which was significantly lower than those receiving SDC (nadir: 80.7 +/- 12.3%). DPTS occurred in 72% of patients receiving HDC as compared with only 4% of patients receiving SDC. All individuals diagnosed with DPTS were treated with prednisone and the 2-yr follow-up of pulmonary function revealed a gradual improvement in mean DL(CO) such that there were no differences between HDC and SDC groups at the end of the study. No mortality was attributable to pulmonary toxicity in either group. After induction chemotherapy, but before HDC, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) demonstrated significant elevations in interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. We conclude that induction CAF produces asymptomatic pulmonary dysfunction and inflammation which may prime the lungs for further injury by HDC and predispose to the development of DPTS. Fortunately, in this specific ABMT patient population, the early and judicious use of prednisone appears to improve pulmonary function in patients who develop DPTS.",1
Management of patients with brain metastases receiving trastuzumab treatment for metastatic breast cancer.,"Background: With the more effective control of visceral metastases in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC), an increasing number of patients face brain metastases (BM). The aim of this retrospective analysis was to investigate the incidence and factors affecting the prognosis of patients with BM under trastuzumab treatment for MBC. Patients and Methods: A total of 75 HER2positive patients treated with trastuzumab for MBC were included. Results are discussed in the context of the current literature. Results: Patients who developed BM (n = 29) had longer median progression-free survival (PFS) during first-line chemotherapy and longer overall survival (OS) after diagnosis of MBC than 46 patients without BM (PFS: 27 vs. 14 months, p = 0.039; OS: 46 vs. 18 months, p = 0.067). Median survival of patients with continuation of trastuzumab after diagnosis of BM was longer than survival of patients with discontinuation of trastuzumab treatment after BM (18 vs. 3 months, p = 0.006). Survival of patients who were treated with surgery and radiotherapy for BM was better compared with radiotherapy alone (9 vs. 5 months, p = not significant) or best supportive care (9 vs. 2 months, p = 0.049). Conclusions: Continuation of trastuzumab treatment as well as resection of BM seem to give further benefit in the treatment of patients with HER2-overexpressing MBC.",0
Primary chemotherapy effect in sentinel node detection in breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: Sentinel node (SN) biopsy is a reliable method for improved staging of breast cancer, offering an alternative to routine axillary dissection. Perhaps preoperative chemotherapy could increase the rate of false-negative SN because of induced lymphatic changes. The aim of the study was to evaluate the utility of lymphoscintigraphy and of hand-held probe detection in the SN approach after chemotherapy, correlating it with histologic analysis of the axilla. METHODS: Eighty-three patients (mean age, 53 years; TNM stage I) were studied prospectively. They were separated into two groups: group 1 (G1), 37 patients with preoperative chemotherapy and group 2 (G2), 46 patients without chemotherapy. Mean tumor size was 2 cm in both groups. Lymphoscintigraphy was performed 3 to 4 hours after peritumoral injection of Tc-99m dextran-70 in a 0.2-ml volume and activity of 14.8 MBq (0.4 mCi), performed under ultrasound or mammographic control. On the following day, each patient underwent tumor resection with axillary dissection, included the SN. RESULTS: The SN was detected by scintigraphy in 78 patients (94%). The failure of SN to predict the axillary histologic status was significantly higher (P = 0.01) in G1 than in G2 (7 and 1 false-negative result, respectively). CONCLUSION: Preoperative chemotherapy seems to impair axillary evaluation by SN biopsy and should be used cautiously in this subset of patients.",0
"Phase II, double-blind, randomized trial of capecitabine plus enzastaurin versus capecitabine plus placebo in patients with metastatic or recurrent breast cancer after prior anthracycline and taxane therapy.","Capecitabine is frequently used in the treatment of recurrent/progressive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) after prior anthracycline and taxane therapy. With the intention of improving the efficacy of single agent capecitabine, we initiated a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II study of the novel serine/threonine kinase inhibitor enzastaurin in combination with capecitabine in a heavily pretreated patient population. Patients received capecitabine 1,250 mg/m(2) twice daily plus enzastaurin 500 mg/day, or capecitabine plus placebo. The capecitabine was administered for the first 14 days of each 21 day cycle. The primary outcome was progression-free survival (PFS) using the log-rank test (1-sided significance level of 0.20). Of 109 patients assessed for eligibility, 85 were enrolled, randomized, and treated (42 and 43 patients in each respective treatment group). The study was terminated early following a preplanned futility analysis. Median PFS (95% CI) was 2.8 (2.1-4.6) months with capecitabine plus enzastaurin versus 4.3 (2.9-6.2) months with capecitabine plus placebo (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.728 [1.00-2.97]; P = 0.048). Median overall survival (95% CI) was lower with capecitabine plus enzastaurin than with capecitabine plus placebo (9.9 [7.0-16.6] months vs 14.9 [9.9-19.3] months, P = 0.181). Grade 3/4 adverse events were more frequent with capecitabine plus enzastaurin (42.9% vs 32.6%). Given the lack of PFS benefit, capecitabine plus enzastaurin is unsuitable as therapy for patients with recurrent/progressive MBC after prior anthracycline and taxane therapy. This trial is registered on www.clinicaltrials.gov (identifier: NCT00437294).",1
Increased breast-cancer recurrence rate after adjuvant therapy with levamisole. A preliminary report. Executive Committee of the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group.,"After total mastectomy with partial axillary-lymph-node biopsy, patients with breast carcinomas with histologically positive lymph-nodes but without distant metastasis (N+, Mo) were allocated at random to receive either radiotherapy alone (384 patients) or radiotherapy plus levamisole 2.5 mg/kg/day for two consecutive days each week for 48 weeks (336 patients). At 1 year the levamisole-treated patients had a significantly higher recurrence rate than the radiotherapy-only group. They also had an unacceptably high incidence of side-effects, especially patients aged over 50. The frequency of levamisole-induced agranulocytosis was 3.6% and leucopenia 15-20%. These preliminary results suggest that adjuvant therapy with levamisole should not be used in patients with N+, Mo breast carcinoma.",0
Clinical effects of whole-body hyperthermia in adnanced malignancy.,"Fifty-one patients in the terminal stages of cancer have been treated with whole-body hyperthermia either alone (38 cases) or in combination with chemotherapy (13 cases). Altogether 227 treatment sessions were held averaging four hours each. The most sensitive tumours were those of the gastrointestinal tract and sarcomas. Breast and genitourinary tumours did not respond, and lung tumours and melanomas were only partially responsive. Major complications were remarkably few.",0
"Clinical response after two cycles compared to HER2, Ki-67, p53, and bcl-2 in independently predicting a pathological complete response after preoperative chemotherapy in patients with operable carcinoma of the breast.","INTRODUCTION: To investigate the predictive value of clinical and biological markers for a pathological complete remission after a preoperative dose-dense regimen of doxorubicin and docetaxel, with or without tamoxifen, in primary operable breast cancer. METHODS: Patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of previously untreated, operable, and measurable primary breast cancer (tumour (T), nodes (N) and metastases (M) score: T2-3(> or = 3 cm) N0-2 M0) were treated in a prospectively randomised trial with four cycles of dose-dense (bi-weekly) doxorubicin and docetaxel (ddAT) chemotherapy, with or without tamoxifen, prior to surgery. Clinical and pathological parameters (menopausal status, clinical tumour size and nodal status, grade, and clinical response after two cycles) and a panel of biomarkers (oestrogen and progesterone receptors, Ki-67, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), p53, bcl-2, all detected by immunohistochemistry) were correlated with the detection of a pathological complete response (pCR). RESULTS: A pCR was observed in 9.7% in 248 patients randomised in the study and in 8.6% in the subset of 196 patients with available tumour tissue. Clinically negative axillary lymph nodes, poor tumour differentiation, negative oestrogen receptor status, negative progesterone receptor status, and loss of bcl-2 were significantly predictive for a pCR in a univariate logistic regression model, whereas in a multivariate analysis only the clinical nodal status and hormonal receptor status provided significantly independent information. Backward stepwise logistic regression revealed a response after two cycles, with hormone receptor status and lymph-node status as significant predictors. Patients with a low percentage of cells stained positive for Ki-67 showed a better response when treated with tamoxifen, whereas patients with a high percentage of Ki-67 positive cells did not have an additional benefit when treated with tamoxifen. Tumours overexpressing HER2 showed a similar response to that in HER2-negative patients when treated without tamoxifen, but when HER2-positive tumours were treated with tamoxifen, no pCR was observed. CONCLUSION: Reliable prediction of a pathological complete response after preoperative chemotherapy is not possible with clinical and biological factors routinely determined before start of treatment. The response after two cycles of chemotherapy is a strong but dependent predictor. The only independent factor in this subset of patients was bcl-2.",0
Treatment of skeletal disease in breast cancer with clodronate.,"Complications of breast cancer involving the skeleton include hypercalcaemia, bone pain and fracture. These complications arise because of progressive osteolysis which is in turn dependent on the activation of osteoclasts by tumour and host tissues. Clodronate is a powerful inhibitor of osteoclastic bone resorption which led us to evaluate its potential in metastatic breast cancer. When given intravenously it lowers serum calcium in the majority of hypercalcaemic patients. A convenient regimen is 600 mg iv as a single dose infused over several hours. We have additionally shown in a double-blind cross-over study that this regimen also has a significant effect on bone pain. This had led us to assess the longer term effects of clodronate by mouth in a prospective double-blind study of patients with established skeletal metastases. These studies are not yet complete but the agent appears to prevent hypercalcaemia and trends are emerging which indicate that the incidence of bone pain and fractures may also decrease.",0
Comparable safety and antiemetic efficacy of a brief (30-second bolus) intravenous granisetron infusion and a standard (15-minute) intravenous ondansetron infusion in breast cancer patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy.,"PURPOSE: For patients receiving chemotherapy, optimization of antiemetic therapy in terms of safety of administration, efficacy, cost, and convenience remains a subject of intense clinical research. In this study, we evaluated and compared the safety and antiemetic efficacy of a single 30-second intravenous bolus infusion of granisetron which those of a standard 15-minute intravenous infusion of ondansetron in chemotherapy-naive breast cancer patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND MATERIALS: This was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, multicenter crossover study of 623 chemotherapy-naive patients (two male, 621 female) receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide plus doxorubicin, with or without 5-fluorouracil) for breast cancer. Patients were assigned randomly to receive either granisetron or ondansetron in cycle 1 and the other agent in cycle 2. Granisetron (10 micrograms/kg) was administered as a 30-second intravenous bolus infusion within 5 minutes before the start of chemotherapy, and ondansetron (32 mg) was administered as a 15-minute intravenous infusion beginning 30 minutes before the start of chemotherapy. A total of 573 patients received the two planned chemotherapy cycles. Safety assessment was based on the type and frequency of adverse experiences reported by the patient at 24 and 48 hours after chemotherapy began. Efficacy assessments included the occurrence of nausea or emesis and the proportion of patients who achieved total emetic control at 24 and 48 hours after chemotherapy. RESULTS: Similar proportions of patients in both treatment groups remained free of emesis at the 24-hour assessment period (58.6% and 62.7% of granisetron- and ondansetron-treated patients, respectively) and at 48 hours (42.2% and 45.0% for granisetron vs ondansetron) in both cycles. The proportions of granisetron- and ondansetron-treated patients who remained nausea-free for the first 24 hours after treatment in both cycles were 44.0% and 48.5%, respectively, and at 48 hours were 26.7% and 31.0%, respectively. Statistical analysis demonstrated no significant treatment-by-cycle interaction. The 30-second granisetron infusion and the 15-minute ondansetron infusion were well tolerated. However, administration of ondansetron as a 15-minute intravenous infusion produced abnormal vision (6.28%) in significantly more patients than granisetron (0.35%). DISCUSSION: These two intravenous 5-hydroxytryptamine3-receptor antagonist antiemetics were similarly effective in controlling acute nausea and emesis during two cycles of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. Granisetron (30 seconds) and the longer infusion of ondansetron (15 minutes) were well tolerated; however, ondansetron was associated with a greater proportion of patients reporting abnormal vision. Granisetron administered as a 30-second bolus infusion allows a considerably shorter waiting time between the end of the antiemetic infusion and the initiation of chemotherapy. This shorter administration time may enhance patient convenience and provider efficiency.",0
The benefit of bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals in the treatment of metastatic bone pain.,"PURPOSE: The surface bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals rhenium-188-HEDP (188Re-HEDP) and samarium-153-EDTMP (153Sm-EDTMP) were investigated to determine the efficacy and toxicity in pain palliation in bone metastases. METHOD: The effect of treatment with 188Re-HEDP and 153Sm-EDTMP on pain symptoms, life quality, and bone marrow function were obtained in 46 patients with prostate and breast cancer. There were 31 patients treated with 188Re-HEDP (3194+/-387 MBq) and 15 patients with 153Sm-EDTMP (2940+/-545 MBq). The 188Re-HEDP group included 6 patients and 25 patients, and the 153Sm-EDTMP group 6 patients and 9 patients with breast and prostate cancer, respectively. All patients had an interview using standardized sets of questions before and after therapy for 12 weeks. Blood counts were taken weekly for 6 weeks and after 12 weeks. RESULTS: After treatment with 188Re-HEDP, 77% of patients reported pain relief and 73% after 153Sm-EDTMP. Sixteen percent of the patients treated with 188Re-HEDP and 13% of those given 153Sm-EDTMP could discontinue their analgesics and were pain free. Patients described an improvement on the Karnofsky performance scale from 73+/-7 to 85+/-8% 12 weeks after 188Re-HEDP (p<0.05) and from 68+/-9 to 74+/-9% after 153Sm-EDTMP (p=0.217). Only 3 patients post-188Re-HEDP and 2 patients post-153Sm-EDTMP showed a thrombocytopenia below 100 x 10(3)/microl. The maximum nadir of platelet and leukocyte counts were observed between the second to fourth week after treatment in both and was reversible within 12 weeks. There were no significant differences in pain palliation, Karnofsky performance scale and bone marrow toxicity between the lower beta energy 153Sm-EDTMP and the higher beta energy 188Re-HEDP (p=0.098-0.442). CONCLUSION: Both radiopharmaceuticals were effective in pain palliation, without induction of severe side effects or significant differences in therapeutic efficacy or toxicity.",0
Changes in plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines in response to paclitaxel chemotherapy.,"BACKGROUND: Flu-like symptoms are common, early transient side effects of paclitaxel chemotherapy. We hypothesized that these symptoms may be due to release of inflammatory cytokines in response to treatment. The objective of this study was to assess changes in plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-alpha during chemotherapy and to correlate these changes with musculoskeletal symptoms. METHODS: Ninety patients with breast cancer were included; 70 patients received single agent paclitaxel either weekly or every 3 weeks and 20 received FAC (5-FU, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide) chemotherapy. Fifteen healthy volunteers were included as controls. Cytokines and symptoms were measured before starting therapy, on day 3 and on the last day of one treatment cycle. RESULTS: At baseline, all subjects had measurable levels of IL-8 but only 49% had IL-12, 45% had IL-10, 32% had IL-6, and 21% had IL-1beta or TNF-alpha in their plasma. There was no difference in baseline cytokine levels between cancer patients and the healthy volunteers. Schedule-dependent transient changes in the levels of 3 cytokines were observed in the paclitaxel treated patients. In the every 3-week paclitaxel group, IL-6 and IL-8 increased whereas in the weekly paclitaxel group IL-10 increased significantly compared to baseline. Fatigue and flu-like symptoms were also worse on day 3. In the weekly paclitaxel group, increase in IL-10 level correlated positively with joint pain (p=0.003). In the every 3-week paclitaxel group, increase in IL-8 level correlated positively with flu-like symptom (p=0.008). In the FAC-treated group and among the healthy volunteers none of these cytokines increased significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Weekly paclitaxel induces transient increase in IL-10 levels whereas every 3-week higher dose treatments induce IL-8 and IL-6 in the plasma. These changes correlate with joint pain and flu-like symptoms.",0
Safety profile and activity of lower capecitabine dose in patients with metastatic breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: Capecitabine is an orally administered precursor of 5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine that was rationally designed to generate 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) preferentially in tumor tissue. The drug enables chronic dosing that mimics continuous infusion of 5-FU. Phase II trials of capecitabine at 1250 mg/m2 twice daily for 14 days followed by 7 days of rest, is active in anthracycline- and taxane-pretreated patients; the main toxicity is palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, diarrhea, and nausea. To overcome these side effects, the dose has been reduced to 1000 mg/m2 twice daily with a better therapeutic profile and encouraging efficacy. The aim of our study was to confirm safety and activity of capecitabine at lower doses in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with advanced breast cancer entered the study. The first 7 patients were treated with capecitabine 1250 mg/m2 twice daily (for 14 days followed by 7 days of rest) and the next 30 patients with capecitabine 1000 mg/m2. The median age was 62 years (range, 38-87 years). Thirteen patients were chemotherapy naive and 24 were pretreated with chemotherapy (9 patients, 1 line; 15 patients, > or = 2 lines). Anthracyclines and/or taxane schedules were administered in 22 patients. Soft tissue metastases were documented in 36 patients; visceral metastases in 24 patients; visceral and soft tissue metastases in 23 patients. RESULTS: Thirty patients were evaluable for response (5 at ""higher"" dose and 25 at ""lower"" dose) and all for toxicity. Overall objective response rate was 57% (5 complete responses and 12 partial responses); 95% CI, 39%-74%; stable disease 20% and progressive disease 23%. Eight of 13 chemotherapy-naive patients (61.5%) and 9 of 24 pretreated patients (37.5%) responded to capecitabine, according to the intent-to-treat principle (6 of 9 responses were obtained at a lower dose). Three responses at the ""higher"" dose and 14 at the ""lower"" dose were reported. Median time to progression was 7 months (range, 1-38 months) and median overall survival was 19 months (range, 2-47 months). Toxicity was as follows: grade 2/3 palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia in 9 patients (24%), grade 2/3 asthenia in 7 patients (19%), grade 2 vomiting in 4 patients (11%), grade 2 renal toxicity in 1 patient, grade 2 skin reaction in 1 patient, and suspected cardiac toxicity in 1 patient. CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed that a lower dose of capecitabine has a good toxicity profile and is active in patients with MBC.",1
Quantitative changes in cytological molecular markers during primary medical treatment of breast cancer: a pilot study.,"AIM: To quantify the changes in biological molecular markers during primary medical treatment in patients with operable breast cancer and to assess their possible relationship with response to treatment. METHODS: The treatment group consisted of 31 patients with operable breast carcinomas, median age 57 years (range 41-67), treated with four 3-weekly cycles of chemotherapy with Mitoxantrone, methotrexate (+/- mitomycin C), and tamoxifen before surgery. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) was used to obtain samples from patients prior to and at 10 or 21 days post-treatment. The following molecular markers were assessed: estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), p53, Bcl-2, and Ki67 measured by immunocytochemistry, and ploidy and S-phase fraction (SPF) by flow cytometry. To evaluate the reproducibility of the technique, repeat FNA was performed in a separate non-treatment control group of 20 patients and the same molecular markers assessed, two weeks after the first sample with no intervening treatment. RESULTS: The non-treatment control group showed a high reproducibility for the measurement of molecular markers from repeat FNA. In the treatment group there was a non-significant reduction in SPF and a significant reduction (p = 0.005) in Ki67. Patients who responded to neoadjuvant therapy were more likely to have a reduction in these two markers than those who failed to respond. Similarly, a reduction in ER scores was observed between the first and second samples (p = 0.04). For PgR, the change between the first and second samples was not significant although there was a significant difference between responders and non-responders (p = 0.03). All nine patients with an increase in PgR were responders. No significant changes in p53 or Bcl-2 were observed during treatment. CONCLUSION: Molecular markers can be adequately measured from FNA samples prior to and during neoadjuvant therapy. Changes in cellular proliferation and hormone receptors have been shown that may be related to tumour response. These relationships should be assessed in a larger cohort of patients.",0
5-Fluorouracil by protracted venous infusion: a review of recent clinical studies.,"The pharmacokinetics of continuous infusion 5-fluorouracil make it an ideal drug to administer as a protracted infusion (continuous infusion more than 30 days). During the last decade numerous clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of 5-fluorouracil (5FU) administered as a protracted venous infusion. Phase II studies in metastatic colorectal cancer in 345 patients have demonstrated an average response rate of 36% (range 15-59%) and a prospective randomized study performed by the Mid-Atlantic Oncology Program (MAOP) has confirmed a higher response rate with 5FU infusion compared with a bolus schedule. Phase II studies in refractory carcinoma of the breast in 177 patients have demonstrated a 30% response rate (range 17-50%); studies in pancreatic, gastric, and refractory prostate cancer have also demonstrated clinical utility. The major toxicities of 5FU infusion are mucositis and hand-foot syndrome; life-threatening myelosuppression is rare and treatment-related deaths have not been reported. 5FU infusion is a useful palliative treatment for many adult patients with advanced malignancies.",0
Symptomatic relief for patients with osseous metastasis treated with radiation and methylprednisolone: a prospective randomized study.,"A multi-institutional prospective study to evaluate the relief of symptoms for patients with osseous metastasis treated with irradiation and methylpredonisolone was performed. A total of 38 patients with osseous metastasis, treated between January 1991 and December 1992, were included in this study. Patients were randomly allocated to one of two treatments: radiation alone (RT alone) (n = 18) or radiation combined with methylpredonisolone (RT + MP) (n = 20). Symptoms were scored by patients themselves using original Quality of Life (QOL) scores. Stratification by urinary hydroxyproline/creatinine ratios (Hypro/Cr) showed no significant differences in QOL scores between RT and RT + MP in the group with good prognosis, which showed a lower Hypro/Cr (< 3.6 mg/g) during treatment. Following treatment, the score for both groups improved. On the other hand, in the group with poor prognosis, with a higher Hypro/Cr (> or = 3.6 mg/g), a significantly greater improvement in QOL scores was observed for the RT + MP group than for the RT alone group (p < 0.05). There was also a marked difference in the RTOG pain scores, evaluated by physicians before treatment and at the end of treatment, between the two treatment groups and the prognostic groups divided according to Hypro/Cr. No correlation was seen at initial presentation between urinary Hypro/Cr and serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TrACP). In conclusion, the treatment regimen of RT + MP is recommended for patients with osseous metastasis with poor prognosis who show relatively high Hypro/Cr values. Radiotherapy was equally effective in terms of RTOG pain score for both the poor and good prognostic groups. Serum TrACP was not useful for determining the prognosis of our patient groups.",0
One-hour paclitaxel infusion schedules: a phase I/II comparative trial.,"The safety and feasibility of two 1-hour outpatient paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) infusion schedules were evaluated in a randomized phase I/II study of 56 patients with a variety of resistant and refractory advanced cancers. Paclitaxel 135 mg/m2 was infused as a single dose over 1 hour or was divided into three doses infused over 1 hour on 3 consecutive days. Standard paclitaxel premedications were given. The two schedules produced similar toxicity. Total alopecia was universal. Myelosuppression was the most common severe toxicity: 19% and 2%, respectively, of the 162 courses were associated with grades 3 and 4 leukopenia. Neutropenic fever necessitated nine hospitalizations (eight patients.) Preliminary findings show objective responses in 11 patients (20%). Responders had breast, ovarian, and lung cancers. We conclude that both 1-hour paclitaxel outpatient infusion schedules are safe, and we are currently investigating a 200 mg/m2 dose and the incorporation of the 135 mg/m2 schedules into phase II combination chemotherapy regimens.",1
The role of bisphosphonates in the treatment of bone metastases--the U.S. experience.,"Frequent complications of bone metastases include pain, pathologic fracture, hypercalcemia and spinal cord compression. Lytic bone metastases result from excessive activation of osteoclasts by tumor-produced cytokines. Aredia (pamidronate) is a potent bisphosphonate that inhibits osteoclast activation. In two dose-seeking phase I trials in patients with breast cancer and prostate cancer, repeated intravenous infusion of Aredia was shown to be safe and effective in reducing bone resorption and pain. In a randomized phase III trial of 377 patients with multiple myeloma, Aredia was administered in a dosage of 90 mg i.v. every 4 weeks. Compared with placebo, treatment with Aredia was associated with a significant decrease in bone pain and in the incidence and time to development of all skeleton-related events. Data from two phase III breast cancer trials each involving 300 patients are now being analyzed. The newer bisphosphonates can safely be used together with standard anticancer therapy to provide effective palliation of symptoms caused by lytic bone metastases.",0
"Prospective, randomized trial of sequential interleukin-3 and granulocyte- or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor after standard-dose chemotherapy in cancer patients.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Several in vitro and animal studies have shown that IL-3 primes hematopoietic stem cells to become more sensitive to later acting growth factors. We wanted to compare the toxicity and the synergistic stimulatory effect of interleukin-3 (IL-3) followed by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CFS) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) on white blood cell (WBC) and platelet counts, after standard-dose chemotherapy (CT) in patients with solid tumors. DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifty consecutive cancer patients with thrombocytopenia and/or leukopenia registered during a previous course of CT were randomized to receive, after the following course, IL-3 (10 microg/kg/day, s.c., day 1-5) followed by G- or GM-CSF (5 microg/kg/day, day 6-8). RESULTS: The nadir of WBC in the cycles supported with the combination of IL-3 and G-CSF was significantly higher than that observed in the CT cycles not supported by growth factors (p < 0. 005). Furthermore, severe leukopenia was abrogated in all the cycles supported with IL-3+G-CSF, while in the cycles without cytokines, this event was registered in 62.5% of the cases (p < 0.0005). Finally, the recovery of WBC was achieved a mean of 4 days earlier in the cycles supported with IL-3+G-CSF. As for thrombocytoprotection, no significant differences were evidenced, but severe thrombocytopenia was abrogated in all the cycles supported by IL-3+G-CSF (p < 0.05). Furthermore, platelet recovery after CT was achieved on average 3.5 days earlier in the IL-3+G-CSF group than in the previous cycles. The nadir of WBC count in the cycles supported by the combination of IL-3 and GM-CSF was significantly higher than that observed in the CT cycles not supported by growth factors (p < 0.005). Furthermore, severe leukopenia was abrogated in 40% of the cycles supported by IL-3+GM-CSF, while in the cycles without cytokines, this event was registered in 80% of the cases (p < 0.005). Finally, the recovery of WBC was achieved a mean of 3.5 days earlier in the cycles supported by IL-3+GM-CSF. As far as thrombocytoprotection is concerned, there were no significant differences in the nadir between the cycles supported by the association IL-3+GM-CSF and the cycles not supported by cytokines. However, severe thrombocytopenia was registered in 20% of the cycles not supported by growth factors but in only 10% of the cycles supported by IL-3+GM-CSF (p < 0.05). Furthermore, platelet recovery after CT was achieved on average 3 days earlier in the IL-3+GM-CSF group. The combination of IL-3 and G-CSF would appear to be more effective than the combination of IL-3 and GM-CSF in the control of both severe thrombocytopenia and leukopenia. Indeed, severe leukopenia was abrogated in all the cycles in arm A, but only in 40% of the cycles in arm B (p < 0.0005). Furthermore, considering a platelet count below 49",0
A phase III study comparing the clinical utility of four regimens of 5-fluorouracil: a preliminary report.,"A clinical trial involving 462 colon, rectum, and breast cancer patients randomized among four different dosage regimens of 5-FU (an intravenous loading course, a weekly intravenous schedule, a nontoxic schedule, and an oral schedule) has shown a significantly better response among colon-rectum cancer patients for the intravenous loading course. In addition, duration of response and time to progression are also significantly better. Overall survival is approaching significance for the colon rectum group (p value .082). In contrast, breast cancer patients show little difference between treatments. Toxicity is somewhat higher for the loading course.",1
Randomized crossover pharmacokinetic study of solvent-based paclitaxel and nab-paclitaxel.,"PURPOSE: Abraxane (ABI-007) is a 130-nm albumin-bound (nab) particle formulation of paclitaxel, devoid of any additional excipients. We hypothesized that this change in formulation alters the systemic disposition of paclitaxel compared with conventional solvent-based formulations (sb-paclitaxel; Taxol), and leads to improved tolerability of the drug. Patients and Methods: Patients with malignant solid tumors were randomized to receive the recommended single-agent dose of nab-paclitaxel (260 mg/m(2) as a 30-minute infusion) or sb-paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2) as a 3-hour infusion). After cycle 1, patients crossed over to the alternate treatment. Pharmacokinetic studies were carried out for the first cycle of sb-paclitaxel and the first two cycles of nab-paclitaxel. RESULTS: Seventeen patients were treated, with 14 receiving at least one cycle each of nab-paclitaxel and sb-paclitaxel. No change in nab-paclitaxel pharmacokinetics was found between the first and second cycles (P = 0.95), suggesting limited intrasubject variability. Total drug exposure was comparable between the two formulations (P = 0.55) despite the dose difference. However, exposure to unbound paclitaxel was significantly higher after nab-paclitaxel administration, due to the increased free fraction (0.063 +/- 0.021 versus 0.024 +/- 0.009; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study shows that paclitaxel disposition is subject to considerable variability depending on the formulation used. Because systemic exposure to unbound paclitaxel is likely a driving force behind tumoral uptake, these findings explain, at least in part, previous observations that the administration of nab-paclitaxel is associated with augmented antitumor efficacy compared with solvent-based paclitaxel.",1
"Double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, dose-finding study of oral ibandronate in patients with metastatic bone disease.","BACKGROUND: Bisphosphonates are an important component of the treatment of metastatic bone disease but more potent, oral formulations are required to improve the effectiveness and convenience of treatment. An oral formulation of the new bisphosphonate, ibandronate (BM 21.0955) has recently been developed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred ten patients with bone metastases (77 breast, 16, prostate, 3 myeloma, 14 others) were recruited from a single institution to this double blind placebo-controlled evaluation of four oral dose levels (5, 10, 20 and 50 mg) of ibandronate. No changes in systemic anti-cancer treatment were allowed in the month before commencing treatment or during the study period. After an initial four-week tolerability phase, patients could continue on treatment for a further three months without unblinding; patients initially allocated to placebo received ibandronate 50 mg. The primary endpoint was urinary calcium excretion (UCCR). Bone resorption was also assessed by measurement of pyridinoline (Pyr), deoxypyridinoline (Dpd), and the N-terminal (NTX) and C-terminal (Crosslaps) portions of the collagen crosslinking molecules. RESULTS: Two patients did not receive any trial medication thus, 108 patients were evaluable for safety. Ninety-two patients were evaluable for efficacy. A dose dependent reduction was observed in both UCCR and collagen crosslink excretion. At the 50 mg dose level, the percentage reductions from baseline in UCCR, Pyr, Dpd, Crosslaps and NTX were 71%, 28%, 39%, 80% and 74% respectively. One or more gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events occurring in the first month of treatment were reported by six (30%), seven (33%), nine (39%), nine (41%) and eleven (50%) patients at the placebo, 5, 10, 20 and 50 mg dose levels respectively. One patient (20 mg dose) developed radiographically confirmed oesophageal ulceration. GI tolerability may have been adversely affected by concomitant administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Nine (8%) patients stopped treatment within the first month due to GI intolerability but these patients were evenly distributed across the five treatment groups. There was no difference in non-GI adverse events between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Oral ibandronate has potent effects on the rate of bone resorption at doses which are generally well tolerated. Further development is appropriate to evaluate the effects of long-term administration in the prevention of metastatic bone disease and the management of established skeletal metastases.",0
Assessment of response to tamoxifen among Iraqi patients with advanced breast cancer.,"Eighty-eight women presenting with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer were treated with tamoxifen alone. Estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR) were immunocytochemically analysed in mammary tumour cells obtained by fine needle sampling from 73 patients. Of the breast carcinomas, 34.2% were ER+/PR+ and 43.8% were ER-/PR-. The ER+ content increased with age in postmenopausal women. After tamoxifen treatment objective remission occurred in 39.7% of the women. The overall response rate was 53.3% in the ER+/PR- group and 73.1% in the ER+/PR+ group. However, the response elicited in a case of the ER-/PR- phenotype justified the randomized use of tamoxifen among patients in Iraq where the necessary requirements for hormone receptor assessment are almost unavailable.",0
Darbepoetin alfa administered every 2 weeks alleviates anemia in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.,"The objectives of this study were to assess the safety and efficacy of darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp) administered every 2 weeks in anemic patients with solid tumors receiving chemotherapy. This was an open-label, randomized, active-controlled, multicenter dose-finding study evaluating a range of every-2-week darbepoetin alfa doses. The active control arm received epoetin alfa (Epogen, Procrit) at 40,000 U weekly with a dose increase to 60,000 U weekly for subjects with an inadequate response. The lowest clinically effective doses of darbepoetin alfa in this study were 3.0 and 5.0 microg/kg every 2 weeks, with no additional benefit observed at higher doses. The percentage of patients who achieved a hematopoietic response in the 3.0- and 5.0-microg/kg groups was 66% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 46%-86%) and 84% (95% CI = 67%-100%), respectively, compared with 63% (95% CI = 46%-81%) in the epoetin alfa group. Darbepoetin alfa administered at a dose of 3.0 microg/kg every 2 weeks is safe and effective for treating anemia in patients with solid tumors on chemotherapy, and is comparable to epoetin alfa. A dose increase to 5.0 microg/kg of darbepoetin alfa administered every 2 weeks may be appropriate in patients with an inadequate initial response.",0
Tamoxifen versus high-dose oral medroxyprogesterone acetate as initial endocrine therapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer: a Piedmont Oncology Association study.,"PURPOSE: To determine in a prospective randomized trial whether high-dose orally administered medroxy-progesterone acetate (MPA) was superior to tamoxifen in patients with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer who had received no prior endocrine therapy in either the adjuvant or advanced setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients initially received either tamoxifen 20 mg/d orally or MPA 1 g/d orally. At the time of disease progression, patients were crossed over to the other regimen. Eligibility required patients to be age > or = 18 years, performance status 0 to 3, and estrogen receptor (ER)- or progesterone receptor (PR)-positive or unknown. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-two eligible patients were entered and 166 were assessable for response. Complete plus partial response rates for tamoxifen and MPA were 17% and 34%, respectively (P = .01). Patients with bone metastases had a significantly higher partial response rate with MPA compared with tamoxifen (33% v 13%). Median time to treatment failure was 5.5 months for tamoxifen and 6.3 months for MPA (P = .48). The median survival duration was 24 months for tamoxifen and 33 months for MPA (P = .09). Multivariate analysis showed that treatment significantly influenced response rate, but not time to treatment failure or survival. After treatment failure following MPA, six of 42 patients (14%) treated with tamoxifen responded, compared with six of 49 (12%) treated with MPA following tamoxifen. Both agents were associated with minimal toxicity, but 35% of patients on MPA gained more than 20 lb as opposed to only 2% on tamoxifen. CONCLUSION: In this trial, initial treatment with MPA of endocrine-naive metastatic breast cancer patients was associated with a significantly higher response rate but not with improvement in time to treatment failure or survival, when compared with initial treatment with tamoxifen. Further randomized trials in patients with bone metastases are warranted to determine if high-dose progestin therapy is superior to tamoxifen in these patients.",1
Type 1 receptor tyrosine kinase profiles identify patients with enhanced benefit from anthracyclines in the BR9601 adjuvant breast cancer chemotherapy trial.,"PURPOSE: Patients with early breast cancer who receive anthracycline-containing chemotherapy experience improved relapse-free (RFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with those who receive non-anthracycline-containing chemotherapy. Such benefit, however, may be restricted to women whose tumors have specific molecular characteristics. We tested the hypothesis that HER2, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr)/HER1, HER3, Ki67, and topoisomerase IIalpha expression are predictive of outcome after anthracycline-based chemotherapy.METHODS: Tissue microarrays from 322 of 374 women in the BR9601 trial, which compared cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) with epirubicin followed by CMF (epi-CMF), were analyzed for HER1, 2, 3, 4; Ki67; and topoisomerase IIalpha protein expression and for HER2/topoisomerase IIalpha gene amplification. Their relationships to RFS and OS were investigated, and multiple regression analysis was used to identify interactions.RESULTS: A significant interaction was seen between tumors with normal HER1, HER2 fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), or HER3 levels and the enhanced benefit from epi-CMF versus CMF for RFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.36; HR for overexpressed HER1 or HER2 FISH or HER3, 0.92; P = .035) and for OS (HR, 0.30; HR for overexpressed HER1 or HER2 FISH or HER3), 0.98; P = .023). Neither Ki67 nor TIIalpha expressions or gene alterations showed clear predictive value for benefit from the addition of the anthracycline.CONCLUSION: Patients with HER2 amplified and those with HER1, HER2 FISH, or HER3-positive tumors did not benefit from the addition of epirubicin to CMF. Conversely, patients with HER2 nonamplified and HER1 through HER3-negative tumors showed significantly increased RFS and OS rates when treated with epi-CMF compared with CMF.",0
"Anastrozole versus tamoxifen as first-line therapy in postmenopausal patients with hormone-dependent advanced breast cancer: a prospective, randomized, phase III study.","A prospective phase III trial comparing anastrozole with tamoxifen as first-line therapy in postmenopausal, hormone-dependent, advanced breast cancer (ABC). Patients were randomized to anastrozole 1 mg daily (n = 121) or tamoxifen 40 mg daily (n = 117). Efficacy and tolerability were evaluated after 3 months' therapy, and survival was evaluated at median time of follow-up. At a median follow-up of 13.3 months, clinical benefit (CB) was achieved in 83% and 56% of anastrozole and tamoxifen patients, respectively (p < 0.001); median time to disease progression (TTP) in patients achieving CB was 18.0 months and 7.0 months, respectively, (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.13, 95% CI = 0.08-0.20, p < 0.01). At data cutoff, 89% of tamoxifen patients had died, compared with 60% of anastrozole patients; median time to death was 17.4 months and 16.0 months, respectively (HR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.47-0.86, p = 0.003). Therapy was well tolerated in both groups. Anastrozole showed significant advantages over tamoxifen for CB, median TTP in patients gaining CB, and survival. These data further support routine use of anastrozole as first-line treatment for postmenopausal hormone-dependent ABC.",1
Cell proliferation and outcome following doxorubicin plus CMF regimens in node-positive breast cancer.,"At the Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milan, a randomised adjuvant chemotherapy trial was carried out from 1982 to 1990 to compare alternating with sequential regimens of doxorubicin and CMF in 403 patients with more than 3 positive axillary nodes. Tumour proliferative activity was determined in 71% (285 cases) of women entering the clinical study. We investigated the relation between proliferative rate, determined as the [(3)H]thymidine labelling index (TLI) on tumour specimens obtained at diagnostic surgery, and clinical outcome following the 2 regimens, in which the same drugs were administered at the same dose intensity but with a different schedule. A high TLI was significantly associated with 12-year overall relapse (P = 0.009), distant metastasis (P = 0.001), and death (P = 0.002), even in the presence of information provided by tumour size, lymph node involvement, oestrogen receptors, and treatment regimen. The highest relapse-free survival (RFS) probability (45%, 95% CI 34-55%) was observed for patients with tumour TLI <5% and subjected to the sequential treatment. The lowest RFS probability (11%, 95% CI 0-26%) was observed for patients with tumour TLI >9% following the alternating regimen. Intermediate RFS probabilities, ranging from 23% to 34%, were observed for the other kinetic subgroups following the 2 treatment regimens. The benefit of sequential administration of doxorubicin and CMF was evident mainly in patients with tumours at low to intermediate proliferation.",0
Adjuvant chemotherapy with sequential or concurrent anthracycline and docetaxel: Breast International Group 02-98 randomized trial.,"BACKGROUND: Docetaxel is more effective than doxorubicin for patients with advanced breast cancer. The Breast International Group 02-98 randomized trial tested the effect of incorporating docetaxel into anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy and compared sequential vs concurrent administration of doxorubicin and docetaxel.METHODS: Patients with lymph node-positive breast cancer (n = 2887) were randomly assigned to one of four treatments: 1) sequential control (four cycles of doxorubicin at 75 mg/m2, followed by three cycles of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil [CMF]); 2) concurrent control (four cycles of doxorubicin at 60 mg/m2 plus cyclophosphamide at 600 mg/m2, followed by three cycles of CMF); 3) sequential docetaxel (three cycles of doxorubicin at 75 mg/m2, followed by three cycles of docetaxel at 100 mg/m2, followed by three cycles of CMF); 4) concurrent docetaxel (four cycles of doxorubicin at 50 mg/m2 plus docetaxel at 75 mg/m2, followed by three cycles of CMF). The primary comparison evaluated the efficacy of including docetaxel regardless of schedule and was planned after 1215 disease-free survival (DFS) events (ie, relapse, second primary cancer, or death from any cause). Docetaxel and control treatment groups were compared by log-rank tests, and hazard ratios (HR) of DFS events were calculated by Cox modeling. All statistical tests were two-sided.RESULTS: Due to a lower-than-anticipated rate of relapse, this analysis was performed after 5 years with 732 events. Patients in control arms had a 5-year DFS of 73% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 70% to 75%). Docetaxel treatment resulted in an improvement in DFS of borderline statistical significance compared with control treatment (HR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.74 to 1.00; P = .05). However, DFS in the sequential docetaxel arm was better than that in the concurrent docetaxel arm (HR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.69 to 1.00) and in the sequential control arm (HR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.64 to 0.98).CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating docetaxel into anthracycline-based therapy resulted in an improvement in DFS that was of borderline statistical significance. However, important differences may be related to doxorubicin and docetaxel scheduling, with sequential but not concurrent administration, appearing to produce better DFS than anthracycline-based chemotherapy.",1
Quantitative measurement of epidermal growth factor receptor is a negative predictive factor for tamoxifen response in hormone receptor positive premenopausal breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: Although there is evidence for interaction between epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and estrogen receptor (ER), it is still not clear how this affects response to endocrine therapies like tamoxifen. Here we assess the relationship between EGFR expression and tamoxifen response, with a new quantitative technology. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A tissue microarray was constructed from breast cancer from a cohort of 564 patients enrolled in a randomized clinical trial for adjuvant tamoxifen treatment in early breast cancer, with a median follow-up of 14 years. EGFR expression was measured using automated quantitative analysis, a fluorescence-based method for quantitative analysis of in situ protein expression. RESULTS: In ER-positive patients, tamoxifen-treated patients with low EGFR expression (n = 113) showed a significant effect by 2 years of adjuvant tamoxifen (P = .01), in contrast to no treatment effect in the EGFR-high group (n = 73, P = .69). The untreated group showed 49% v 57% 10-year recurrence-free survival for EGFR low versus high (P = .466) in the corresponding group of ER-positive patients. A significant beneficial effect of tamoxifen treatment was seen in the EGFR-low group (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.43 (95% CI, 0.22 to 0.84; P = .013) in contrast to no effect in the EGFR-high group (HR = 1.14; 95% CI, 0.59 to 2.22; P = .7) by using a Cox model. CONCLUSION: This study provides clinical evidence that confirms the basic work that has shown high EGFR can indicate resistance to tamoxifen. It suggests that careful measurement of EGFR protein expression might define a subset of low-stage patients that could benefit from an alternative therapy.",0
Biotherapy with the pineal immunomodulating hormone melatonin versus melatonin plus aloe vera in untreatable advanced solid neoplasms.,"The possibility of natural cancer therapy has been recently suggested by advances in the knowledge of tumor immunobiology. Either cytokines such as IL-2, or neurohormones, such as the pineal indole melatonin (MLT), may activate anticancer immunity. In addition, immunomodulating substances have also been isolated from plants, particularly from Aloe vera. Preliminary clinical studies had already shown that MLT may induce some benefits in untreatable metastatic solid tumor patients, whereas, for the time being, no clinical trial has been performed with aloe products. We have carried out a clinical study to evaluate whether the concomitant administration of aloe may enhance the therapeutic results of MLT in patients with advanced solid tumors for whom no effective standard anticancer therapies are available. The study included 50 patients suffering from lung cancer, gastrointestinal tract tumors, breast cancer or brain glioblastoma, who were treated with MLT alone (20 mg/day orally in the dark period) or MLT plus A. vera tincture (1 ml twice/day). A partial response (PR) was achieved in 2/24 patients treated with MLT plus aloe and in none of the patients treated with MLT alone. Stable disease (SD) was achieved in 12/24 and in 7/26 patients treated with MLT plus aloe or MLT alone, respectively. Therefore, the percentage of nonprogressing patients (PR + SD) was significantly higher in the group treated with MLT plus aloe than in the MLT gorup (14/24 vs. 7/26, p < 0.05). The percent 1-year survival was significantly higher in patients treated with MLT plus aloe (9/24 vs. 4/26, p < 0.05). Both treatments were well tolerated. This preliminary study would suggest that natural cancer therapy with MLT plus A. vera extracts may produce some therapeutic benefits, at least in terms of stabilization of disease and survival, in patients with advanced solid tumors, for whom no other standard effective therapy is available.",0
Concurrent vs sequential adjuvant chemotherapy and hormone therapy in breast cancer: a multicenter randomized phase III trial.,"BACKGROUND: The most appropriate timing of chemotherapy and hormone therapy administration is a critical issue in early breast cancer patients. The purpose of our study was to compare the efficacy of concurrent vs sequential administration of adjuvant chemotherapy and tamoxifen. METHODS: Women with node-positive primary breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive tamoxifen (20 mg/d for 5 years) during (concurrent arm) or after (sequential arm) adjuvant chemotherapy. Chemotherapy consisted of alternating regimens of cyclophosphamide, epidoxorubicin, and 5-fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil every 21 days for a total of 12 cycles. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and secondary endpoints were toxic effects and disease-free survival (DFS). No provision for interim analyses was made in the original study protocol. Survival curves were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariable Cox regression models, adjusted for age, menopausal status, tumor stage, and lymph node and hormone receptor status, were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: From 1985 to 1992, 431 patients were randomly assigned and studied according to the intention-to-treat principle. After a maximum of 15.4 years of follow-up (median 12.3 years), the estimated actuarial 10-year OS was equivalent for the two study arms (concurrent arm: 111 patients, 66%, 95% CI = 59% to 72%; sequential arm: 114 patients, 65%, 95% CI = 59% to 72%, P = .86). No differences in DFS and toxic effects were evident. Four interim analyses were performed, but no alpha error adjustment was necessary because of the largely negative results of this final analysis (sequential vs concurrent arm: HR of death = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.78 to 1.44, P = .76; HR of relapse = 1.16, 95% CI = 0.88 to 1.52, P = .36). CONCLUSIONS: No statistically significant differences in OS, DFS, and toxic effects between concurrent and sequential adjuvant chemo- and hormone therapies were observed. Our study does not support the superiority of one schedule of chemo- and hormone-therapy administration over the other. However, because of the limited statistical power of the study, these results must be considered with caution.",1
"A randomized multicenter trial of cyclophosphamide, Novantrone and 5-fluorouracil (CNF) versus cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin and 5-fluorouracil (CAF) in patients with metastatic breast cancer.","As of August 1984, 115 women with advanced breast cancer have been randomized to receive a combination of either cyclophosphamide, Novantrone (mitoxantrone) and 5-fluorouracil (CNF) or cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin (doxorubicin) and 5-fluorouracil (CAF). Seventy-one percent of all patients were post-menopausal and 44% of CNF patients and 57% of CAF patients were estrogen receptor (ER) negative. Slightly over 30% of all patients had received hormonal therapy or chemotherapy in an adjuvant setting. Hematologic toxicity was similar in regard to platelet counts but slightly lower nadirs were experienced with CNF therapy than with CAF. However, there were fewer dosage decreases with CNF. Significantly less nausea and vomiting were observed with the CNF regimen compared to CAF. Moreover, alopecia was reduced appreciably in patients who received CNF. The response rate to CNF for the first 38 eligible and evaluable patients was 42%, and for 53 eligible and evaluable patients who received CAF the response rate was 45%, a non-significant difference. Median response durations were similar also, 140 days for CNF and 168 days for the CAF regimen. Time to treatment failure was similar for both regimens. CNF is an effective regimen for patients with advanced breast cancer, with less toxicity than CAF.",1
"Mitomycin and tamoxifen versus mitolactol, doxorubicin, and tamoxifen in patients with previously treated breast cancer.","One hundred thirty patients with previously treated advanced breast cancer were treated in a cooperative trial to investigate the effect of mitomycin plus tamoxifen (MT) and to compare its relative value to combination therapy with mitolactol, doxorubicin (ADM), and tamoxifen. An additional 76 patients who had had prior exposure to ADM were randomized to receive MT or MT plus fluoxymesterone. MT versus mitolactol, ADM, and tamoxifen was not significantly different in efficacy; however, there were significant differences in toxicity. This study showed that MT is an effective and acceptable second-line treatment for advanced breast cancer.",1
Adherence and persistence with oral adjuvant chemotherapy in older women with early-stage breast cancer in CALGB 49907: adherence companion study 60104.,"PURPOSE: Patient adherence is critical in evaluating the effectiveness of an oral therapy. We sought to measure adherence among women randomly assigned to capecitabine in a preplanned substudy of a multicenter clinical trial.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cancer and Leukemia Group B study CALGB 49907 was a randomly assigned trial comparing standard chemotherapy versus oral chemotherapy with capecitabine in patients age 65 years or older with early-stage breast cancer. We used microelectronic monitoring system (MEMS) caps on participants' capecitabine bottles to record pill bottle openings. Capecitabine was given in two divided daily doses for 14 consecutive days of a 21-day cycle for six cycles. Adherence was calculated as the number of doses taken divided by doses expected, taking into account toxicity-related dosing changes. A participant was defined as adherent if 80% or more of expected doses were recorded by MEMS.RESULTS: Overall, 161 patients were enrolled. Median age was 71 years (range, 65 to 89 years); 124 patients (83%) persisted with capecitabine to completion of planned protocol therapy. Adherence was 78% across all cycles, and adherence did not vary by cycle (P = .32). Twenty-five percent of participants took fewer than 80% of expected doses and were nonadherent. In a logistic regression model, participants with node-negative disease (P = .01) and mastectomy (P = .01) were more likely to be nonadherent. Adherence was not related to age, tumor stage, or hormone receptor status. Adherence was not significantly associated with relapse-free survival or grade 3 or 4 toxicity.CONCLUSION: Most older women with early-stage breast cancer were adherent to short-term oral chemotherapy in a randomized clinical trial. Age was not associated with adherence.",0
Do DNA ploidy and S-phase fraction in primary tumour predict the response to chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer?,"The relationship between the response to chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, epirubicin and fluorouracil as well as the time to progression of metastasised breast cancer and DNA ploidy and S-phase fraction (SPF) of primary tumours was examined using paraffin-embedded tumour tissue from 81 patients. The response to chemotherapy was significantly better in patients with tumours with a high SPF, and in addition the time to progression was longer in the high-SPF group. There was no significant difference when the DNA ploidy and response to treatment were compared.",0
Peripheral blood progenitor cell mobilization using stem cell factor in combination with filgrastim in breast cancer patients.,"The safety and optimal dose and schedule of stem cell factor (SCF) administered in combination with filgrastim for the mobilization of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) was determined in 215 patients with high-risk breast cancer. Patients received either filgrastim alone (10 microg/kg/d for 7 days) or the combination of 10 microg/kg/d filgrastim and 5 to 30 microg/kg/d SCF for either 7, 10, or 13 days. SCF patients were premedicated with antiallergy prophylaxis. Leukapheresis was performed on the final 3 days of cytokine therapy and, after high-dose chemotherapy and infusion of PBPCs, patients received 10 microg/kg/d filgrastim until absolute neutrophil count recovery. The median number of CD34+ cells collected was greater for patients receiving the combination of filgrastim and SCF, at doses greater than 10 microg/kg/d, than for those receiving filgrastim alone (7.7 v 3.2 x 10(6)/kg, P < .05). There were significantly (P < .05) more CD34+ cells harvested for the 20 microg/kg/d SCF (median, 7.9 x 10(6)/kg) and 25 microg/kg/d SCF (median, 13.6 x 10(6)/kg) 7-day combination groups than for the filgrastim alone patients (median, 3.2 x 10(6)/kg). The duration of administration of SCF and filgrastim (7, 10, or 13 days) did not significantly affect CD34+ cell yield. Treatment groups mobilized with filgrastim alone or with the cytokine combination had similar hematopoietic engraftment and overall survival after PBPC infusion. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that SCF therapy enhances CD34+ cell yield and is associated with manageable levels of toxicity when combined with filgrastim for PBPC mobilization. The combination of 20 microg/kg/d SCF and 10 microg/kg/d filgrastim with daily apheresis beginning on day 5 was selected as the optimal dose and schedule for the mobilization of PBPCs.",0
Systemic therapy in resectable breast cancer.,"There is now convincing evidence that adjuvant systemic therapy for high-risk breast cancer can significantly reduce tumor mortality at 5 years. The overall treatment benefit for women with node-positive tumors may be considered moderate but clinically important. The most frequent choices of chemotherapy and hormonal therapy are discussed. In patients with node-negative receptor-negative tumors there is preliminary evidence of benefit from adjuvant combination chemotherapy. Primary (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy can allow conservative surgery in most tumors suitable for mastectomy, but this form of treatment remains, at present, experimental. Potential long-term toxicity from systemic adjuvant therapy should be continuously monitored.",0
Single-injection depot progesterone before surgery and survival in women with operable breast cancer: a randomized controlled trial.,"PURPOSE: Many nonrandomized studies have suggested better outcome for patients with breast cancer who undergo surgery during the luteal (progestogenic) phase of their menstrual cycle, but this is controversial. We investigated the effect of a single preoperative injection of hydroxyprogesterone in women with operable breast cancer (OBC) in a randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT00123669). PATIENTS AND METHODS: One thousand patients with OBC were randomly assigned to receive surgery or an intramuscular injection of depot hydroxyprogesterone 500 mg 5 to 14 days before surgery. Primary and secondary end points were disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), respectively. An analysis by axillary lymph node status was preplanned. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 65 months among 976 eligible patients, 273 recurrences and 202 deaths were recorded. In the progesterone group versus control group, 5-year DFS and OS rates were 73.9% v 70.2% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.87; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.09; P = .23) and 80.2% v 78.4% (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.21; P = .53), respectively. In 471 node-positive patients, the 5-year DFS and OS rates in the progesterone group versus control group were 65.3% v 54.7% (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.97; P = .02) and 75.7% v 66.8% (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.99; P = .04), respectively. In multivariate analysis, DFS was significantly improved with progesterone in node-positive patients (adjusted HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.95; P = .02), whereas there was no significant effect in node-negative patients (P for interaction = .04). CONCLUSION: A single injection of hydroxyprogesterone before surgery did not improve outcomes in all women with OBC. This intervention showed significant improvement in node-positive women that may be considered hypothesis generating. If replicated in other studies, this could be a simple and inexpensive intervention, especially in developing countries where the incidence of lymph node metastasis is high.",0
"Controlled clinical trials with fenretinide in breast cancer, basal cell carcinoma and oral leukoplakia.","We are conducting three randomized studies (breast cancer, basal cell carcinoma, oral leukoplakia) and report our methodological approach and accrual here. The aim of the breast cancer study is prevention of a contralateral primary lesion in women already treated for breast cancer; the aim of the basal cell carcinoma study is prevention of recurrences or new occurrence after surgical resection; and the aim of the oral leukoplakia study is prevention of recurrences and new occurrence after CO2 laser resection. The studies were planned according to a randomized design with an intervention arm vs a no-treatment arm. Patients in the intervention group receive 4-HPR at a dose of 200 mg po. The duration of treatment is five years in the breast cancer study, and one year in the basal cell carcinoma and oral leukoplakia studies. The breast cancer study started in March 1987, closing accrual on July 31, 1993. A total of 2,972 patients entered the study; 2,849 were evaluable (1,422 in the 4-HPR group and 1,427 in the control group). Of 2,849 evaluable patients, 867 completed the first five years, 1,142 are still ongoing, and 840 patients have interrupted the study for various reasons. Follow-up is ongoing. The basal cell carcinoma study started in January 1990. As of January 1994, a total of 786 patients had entered the study; 760 were evaluable (363 in the 4-HPR group and 367 in the control group). Of 760 patients in the study, 568 completed the first year, 62 are ongoing and 130 discontinued for various reasons. The study is ongoing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0
Results of a breast-cancer-surgery trial compared with observational data from routine practice.,"BACKGROUND: The strength of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is that they allow investigators to draw reliable inferences about treatment differences; physicians can then make a choice between different options. Their weakness is that they are conducted on a set of patients who cannot be regarded as a random sample from the population that will be treated outside the trial. Observational data collected in a prospective clinical database may provide more realistic estimates. METHODS: At the Istituto Nazionale de Tumori of Milan an RCT was started in 1973 (MI1) in which Halsted mastectomy was compared with quadrantectomy plus axillary dissection and radiotherapy (QUART), a breast conserving treatment, for ""early-stage"" primary breast cancer. In addition, a prospective clinical database was established to collect, in standard format, information on all women undergoing breast conservation thereafter and followed up at the Institute. 1760 women were treated with QUART, 350 of them being accrued in the years 1973-80 in the context of the MI1 trial. The remaining 1408 received QUART after the MI1 trial, up to December, 1984. RESULTS: In the years after the trial, the criteria for use of QUART became more liberal. However, after adjustment for baseline characteristics, out-trial patients fared no worse than trial patients in terms of survival or distant metastasis. Out-trial patients did have a slightly higher rate of local recurrence, probably because of subtle and multiple changes in the surgical procedures since the time of the trial. INTERPRETATION: The results of QUART in out-trial patients resembled those reported from research settings. In this instance, the results of clinical trials did not exaggerate the benefits obtainable in routine practice.",0
Toxicity and efficacy of escalating dosages of recombinant human interleukin-6 after chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer or non-small-cell lung cancer.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of varying doses of recombinant human interleukin-6 (rhIL-6) after chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this phase I/II study, 19 breast (stage III to IV) or non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients received mitoxantrone (10 mg/m2) and thiotepa (40 mg/m2) every 3 weeks, followed by rhIL-6 subcutaneously (days 5 to 15) at six dose levels: 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, and 20.0 micrograms/kg/d body weight/d (micrograms/kg/d). rhIL-6 was increased to the next level in the individual patient in case of incomplete bone marrow recovery (leukocyte count < 3 x 10(9)/L and/or platelet count < 100 x 10(9)/L at day 22) and/or platelet nadir less than 25 x 10(9)/L in two consecutive cycles. RESULTS: Flu-like symptoms were observed in most of the patients. Nausea and vomiting were reported in seven of 48 and 19 of 48 cycles, respectively. Dose-limiting toxicity at 20.0 micrograms/kg/d of rhIL-6 consisted of World Health Organization (WHO) grade 3 to 4 flu-like symptoms, nausea, and vomiting. Platelet recovery was faster in cycle 1 at 10.0 and 20.0 micrograms/kg/d of rhIL-6 than at lower dose levels (P < .05); thrombocytopenia grade 4 was observed at most levels. However, only two patients needed platelet transfusions (1.0 and 2.5 micrograms/kg/d rhIL-6). rhIL-6 effects on leukocytes were not dose-related, with a trend for the neutrophil nadir to increase with rhIL-6 up to 10 micrograms/kg/d. rhIL-6 dose escalation did not affect hematologic parameters and chemotherapy cycle duration. Hemoglobin (P < .001) and cholesterol (P < .05) levels decreased, while acute-phase proteins increased. CONCLUSION: rhIL-6 following chemotherapy is tolerable up to 10 micrograms/kg/d; flu-like symptoms and nausea were dose-limiting at 20 micrograms/kg/d. Platelet nadir did not differ for the various rhIL-6 doses. However, a faster platelet recovery was observed at 10.0 and 20.0 micrograms/kg/d of rhIL-6.",1
"A randomized, prospective trial of adjuvant chemotherapy in adults with soft tissue sarcomas of the head and neck, breast, and trunk.","Since 1977, 31 patients were entered in a randomized, prospective study testing the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy after aggressive local treatment of high-grade sarcomas of the head, neck, breast, and trunk (excluding retroperitoneal sarcomas). All patients had complete resection of gross tumor and underwent postoperative radiotherapy (6000-6300 rads over 7-8 weeks). Seventeen patients received adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin (less than or equal to 550 mg/m2), cyclophosphamide (less than or equal to 5500 mg/m2), and methotrexate (less than or equal to 1000 mg/kg). Three-year actuarial disease-free survival in the chemotherapy arm was 77%, compared to 49% in the no-chemotherapy arm (P = 0.075). Three-year overall actuarial survivals in the two treatment arms, however, were 68% and 58%, respectively (P = 0.38). Considering only patients with tumors of the trunk (22 patients), 3-year actuarial disease-free survival in the chemotherapy arm was 92%, compared to 47% in the no-chemotherapy arm (P = 0.006). Actuarial 3-year overall survival in the chemotherapy arm was 82%, compared to 61% in the no-chemotherapy arm (P = 0.18). An additional 26 patients were treated in an identical fashion, but were not part of the randomized trial because of contraindications to chemotherapy, refusal to enter the randomized trial, or because they were treated before 1977 in a trial in which all patients received chemotherapy. Considering the entire group of 57 patients, follow-up ranged from 10 to 86 months (median, 35 months). Local control was achieved in 46 patients (81%); 3-year actuarial disease-free and overall survivals were 67% and 77%, respectively. A tendency toward improved disease-free survival was apparent among patients treated with chemotherapy (P = 0.018), but there was no statistically significant improvement in overall actuarial survival (P = 0.46). The subgroup of patients with sarcomas of the trunk (39 patients) demonstrated the greatest benefit from chemotherapy, with regard to disease-free survival (P less than or equal to 0.001). The most significant toxicity associated with chemotherapy was doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy, which resulted in clinically apparent congestive heart failure in five patients. Thus, the use of chemotherapy when combined with aggressive local measures appears to improve disease-free survival, but additional patients and longer follow-up are necessary to determine if improved overall survival will result.",0
An aCGH classifier derived from BRCA1-mutated breast cancer and benefit of high-dose platinum-based chemotherapy in HER2-negative breast cancer patients.,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer cells deficient for BRCA1 are hypersensitive to agents inducing DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), such as bifunctional alkylators and platinum agents. Earlier, we had developed a comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) classifier based on BRCA1-mutated breast cancers. We hypothesised that this BRCA1-like(CGH) classifier could also detect loss of function of BRCA1 due to other causes besides mutations and, consequently, might predict sensitivity to DSB-inducing agents. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated this classifier in stage III breast cancer patients, who had been randomly assigned between adjuvant high-dose platinum-based (HD-PB) chemotherapy, a DSB-inducing regimen, and conventional anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Additionally, we assessed BRCA1 loss through mutation or promoter methylation and immunohistochemical basal-like status in the triple-negative subgroup (TN subgroup). RESULTS: We observed greater benefit from HD-PB chemotherapy versus conventional chemotherapy among patients with BRCA1-like(CGH) tumours [41/230 = 18%, multivariate hazard ratio (HR) = 0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04-0.43] compared with patients with non-BRCA1-like(CGH) tumours (189/230 = 82%, HR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.50-1.20), with a significant difference (test for interaction P = 0.006). Similar results were obtained for overall survival (P interaction = 0.04) and when analyses were restricted to the TN subgroup. Sixty-three percent (20/32) of assessable BRCA1-like(CGH) tumours harboured either a BRCA1 mutation (n = 8) or BRCA1 methylation (n = 12). CONCLUSION: BRCA1 loss as assessed by CGH analysis can identify patients with substantially improved outcome after adjuvant DSB-inducing chemotherapy when compared with standard anthracycline-based chemotherapy in our series.",0
Reducing the time interval between cycles using standard doses of docetaxel and lenogastrim support: a feasibility study.,"BACKGROUND: As a single agent, 100 mg/m(2) of docetaxel every 3 weeks remains the standard schedule in the first-line treatment for metastatic disease. At this dose level, the major limiting toxicity is neutropenia. The current study was conducted to assess the feasibility of reducing time intervals between cycles while delivering standard doses of docetaxel with granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; lenograstim). METHODS: In the first part of the study, 24 patients were randomized to receive 1 of 4 schedules: 100 mg/m(2) of docetaxel every 21 days without lenograstim; 100 mg/m(2) of docetaxel every 18 days with lenograstim; 100 mg/m(2) of docetaxel every 14 days with lenograstim; or 100 mg/m(2) of docetaxel every 10 days with lenograstim. In the second part of the study, 15 additional patients were included to confirm the feasibility of the recommended interval between cycles. RESULTS: Of the 39 patients treated, 14 patients (36%) withdrew from therapy because of Grade 3 (according to standard World Health Organization criteria) nonhematologic limiting toxicities. Only 3 patients were treated in the 10-day interval arm and were withdrawn because of toxicity--1 patient had Grade 3 asthenia after the second cycle and 2 patients had Grade 3 dermatitis after 4 cycles. Of the 24 patients treated in the 14-day intervals, Grade 3 limiting toxicities occurred in 8 patients (33%), including dermatitis in 3 patients; diarrhea, myalgia/arthralgia, or asthenia in 4 patients; and ungual toxicity in 1 patient. CONCLUSIONS: Introduction of G-CSF (lenograstim) as primary prophylaxis allowed the administration of docetaxel every 14 days with manageable toxicities. Further studies are now required to assess the impact in terms of response rates and survival in patients with cancer.",0
Correlation of dose intensity and prognosis in adjuvant chemotherapy: an extended controversy.,,0
The potential risk of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients--results from a prospective randomized trial of the Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group (ABCSG-07).,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact that pre- and postoperatively administered chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and fluorouracil (CMF) and postoperative chemotherapy vs. postoperative chemotherapy alone have on long-term prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The ABCSG conducted a nationwide randomized phase III trial in high-risk endocrine non-responsive breast cancer patients comparing pre- and postoperative chemotherapy containing CMF as preoperative treatment vs. postoperative chemotherapy alone between 1991 and 1999. From 1996 the ABCSG-07 protocol was amended to also allow randomization of high-risk endocrine-responsive patients. Of 423 eligible patients with high-risk primary breast cancer, 203 patients were randomly assigned to preoperatively receive three cycles of CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil; 600/40/600 mg/m(2)) intravenously on day 1 and 8, while 195 patients received postoperative chemotherapy alone. In both groups, three cycles of CMF were given initially, and another three cycles of CMF were administered in node-negative patients, whereas node-positive patients received three cycles of EC (epirubicin, cyclophosphamide; 70/600 mg/m(2)). RESULTS: Overall response rate to preoperative chemotherapy with three cycles of CMF was 56.2%; complete pathological response was achieved in 12 patients (5.9%). Recurrence-free survival was significantly better in patients receiving chemotherapy postoperatively (HR 0.7, 0.515-0.955; P = 0.024). No survival difference was observed between the two therapy groups (HR 0.800, 0.563-1.136; P = 0.213). DISCUSSION: Preoperative chemotherapy with CMF has to be considered as insufficient in high-risk breast cancer patients. Delayed surgery and anthracycline-based chemotherapy result in shorter recurrence-free survival but not overall survival.",0
"Comparison of CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil) with a rotational crossing and a sequential intensification regimen in advanced breast cancer: a prospective randomized study.","The Italian Oncology Group for Clinical Research tested two experimental chemotherapy strategies in an attempt to improve the results achievable with conventional chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer. One hundred sixty-two patients were randomly allocated as follows: (a) to the conventional cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy regimen (CMF); (b) to a rotational crossing program (ROT-CROSS); or (c) to a sequential intensification program (SEQ-INT). The same single agents (C, M, F, cisplatin, etoposide, and doxorubicin) were administered in both experimental arms, but following a different policy. The SEQ-INT program induced a significantly higher complete response (32% vs. 6%, p = 0.0006) and objective response rate (72% vs. 42%, p = 0.0047) than CMF did. There were no differences in survival between CMF and either experimental arm. A number of side effects were significantly more with both experimental chemotherapies than with CMF, but the treatments were generally tolerable. Although some caution is required when interpreting a significant advantage found between an entire chemotherapeutic strategy and a single conventional combination, this study documents the potential therapeutic advantage of administering different sequential chemotherapies, and changing each at the time of maximum result without waiting for a progression. The impressive cytoreductive effects achievable with this policy (SEQ-INT) in metastatic disease merit further investigation in the adjuvant setting.",1
Chemosensitivity and stratification by a five monoclonal antibody immunohistochemistry test in the NSABP B14 and B20 trials.,"PURPOSE: To test the association between risk stratification and outcome in a prospectively designed, blinded retrospective study using tissue arrays of available paraffin blocks from the estrogen receptor-expressing, node-negative samples from the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B14 and B20 tamoxifen and chemotherapy trials.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Tissue arrays were stained by immunohistochemistry targeting p53, NDRG1, SLC7A5, CEACAM5, and HTF9C. Risk stratification was done using predefined scoring rules, algorithm for combining scores, and cutoff points for low-risk, moderate-risk, and high-risk patient strata.RESULTS: In a univariate Cox model, this test was significantly associated with recurrence-free interval [HR, 1.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-1.6); P = 0.006]. In a multivariate model it contributed information independent of age, tumor size, and menopausal status (P = 0.007). The Kaplan-Meier estimates of the proportion of recurrence-free after 10 years were 73%, 86%, and 85% for the high-risk, moderate-risk, and low-risk groups (P = 0.001). The Kaplan-Meier estimates of the breast-cancer-specific-death rate were 23%, 10%, and 9% (P < 0.0001). Exploratory analysis in patients >/=60 years old showed Kaplan-Meier estimates of the proportion of recurrence-free of 78%, 89%, and 92%. Both high-risk and low-risk groups showed significant improvement on treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy.CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemistry using five monoclonal antibodies assigns breast cancer patients to a risk index that was significantly associated with clinical outcome among the estrogen receptor-expressing, node-negative tamoxifen-treated patients. It seems that the test may be able to identify patients who have greater absolute benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy compared with unstratified patient populations. Exploratory analysis suggests that this test will be most useful in clinical decision making for postmenopausal patients.",0
"RIBBON-1: randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III trial of chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab for first-line treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer.","PURPOSE: This phase III study compared the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab (BV) when combined with several standard chemotherapy regimens versus those regimens alone for first-line treatment of patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned in 2:1 ratio to chemotherapy plus BV or chemotherapy plus placebo. Before random assignment, investigators chose capecitabine (Cape; 2,000 mg/m(2) for 14 days), taxane (Tax) -based (nab-paclitaxel 260 mg/m(2), docetaxel 75 or 100 mg/m(2)), or anthracycline (Anthra) -based (doxorubicin or epirubicin combinations [doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide, epirubicin/cyclophosphamide, fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide, or fluorouracil/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide]) chemotherapy administered every 3 weeks. BV or placebo was administered at 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included overall survival (OS), 1-year survival rate, objective response rate, duration of objective response, and safety. Two independently powered cohorts defined by the choice of chemotherapy (Cape patients or pooled Tax/Anthra patients) were analyzed in parallel. RESULTS: RIBBON-1 (Regimens in Bevacizumab for Breast Oncology) enrolled 1,237 patients (Cape cohort, n = 615; Tax/Anthra cohort, n = 622). Median PFS was longer for each BV combination (Cape cohort: increased from 5.7 months to 8.6 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.84; log-rank P < .001; and Tax/Anthra cohort: increased from 8.0 months to 9.2 months; HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.80; log-rank P < .001). No statistically significant differences in OS between the placebo- and BV-containing arms were observed. Safety was consistent with results of prior BV trials. CONCLUSION: The combination of BV with Cape, Tax, or Anthra improves clinical benefit in terms of increased PFS in first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer, with a safety profile comparable to prior phase III studies.",1
Cyclin E confers a prognostic value in premenopausal breast cancer patients with tumours exhibiting an infiltrative growth pattern.,"AIMS: To investigate the prognostic value of cyclin E in relation to tumour growth pattern by analysing stage II primary breast cancers from premenopausal women not subjected to any further adjuvant treatment. To analyse the value of cyclin E as a predictor of tamoxifen response, by comparing untreated and treated patients with oestrogen receptor positive tumours. METHODS: Breast cancer samples, assembled in tissue microarrays, were immunohistochemically stained for cyclin E and evaluated regarding the presence of nuclear staining. The overall growth characteristics of each tumour were assessed using whole tissue sections. RESULTS: Tumours displaying a pushing margin phenotype were strongly associated with high cyclin E levels, lymph node negative disease, a high histological grade and oestrogen receptor negativity, and exhibited a better prognosis compared to tumours with an infiltrative growth pattern. In the total cohort of non-treated patients (n = 187), cyclin E was not associated with recurrence free survival (RFS). However, when analysing the subgroup of tumours lacking a pushing growth pattern (n = 141), cyclin E was significantly associated with RFS, independent of histological grade and node status. There was no significant difference in tamoxifen response with regard to different cyclin E levels. CONCLUSION: The prognostic value of cyclin E in premenopausal breast cancer is limited to patients with breast carcinomas exhibiting an exclusively infiltrative growth pattern. This limitation could be explained by the presence of a small but distinct subgroup of cyclin E-high breast cancers with a pushing margin phenotype and a more favourable outcome.",0
Phase III comparison of standard doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide versus weekly doxorubicin and daily oral cyclophosphamide plus granulocyte colony-stimulating factor as neoadjuvant therapy for inflammatory and locally advanced breast cancer: SWOG 0012.,"PURPOSE: Patients with inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) or locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) were randomly assigned to 21-day doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide administered for five cycles (standard arm) versus weekly doxorubicin and daily oral cyclophosphamide administered with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support for 15 weeks (continuous arm). All patients had subsequent weekly paclitaxel for 12 weeks before surgery.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (n = 372) were randomly assigned to the standard arm (n = 186) or the continuous arm (n = 186) stratified by disease type (LABC, n = 256; IBC, n = 116). The primary outcome was microscopic pathologic complete response (pCR) at surgery. Secondary outcomes included disease-free survival, overall survival, and toxicity.RESULTS: More patients in the standard arm had grade 3 to 4 leukopenia and neutropenia, but there were more instances of stomatitis/pharyngitis and hand-foot skin reaction in the continuous arm. Assessed among 356 eligible patients, pCR was not different between the treatment groups stratified by disease type (P = .42). In subset analysis, higher pCR rates were observed in the continuous arm versus the standard arm only for stage IIIB disease (P = .0057) and in IBC (P = .06). Comparison of overall survival and disease-free survival showed no difference between treatment groups (P = .37 and P = .87, respectively).CONCLUSION: No significant clinical benefit was seen for the investigational arm in this trial overall.",1
A multicenter prospective phase II randomized trial of epirubicin/vinorelbine versus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin/vinorelbine as first-line treatment in advanced breast cancer. A GOIM study.,"BACKGROUND: To evaluate activity and tolerability of two anthracycline-containing regimens as first-line treatment for anthracycline-naïve relapsed breast cancer patients.METHODS: Patients with relapsed breast cancer not previously treated with adjuvant anthracyclines were randomly assigned to epirubicin/vinorelbine (arm A: EPI/VNB, EPI 90 mg/m2 on day 1, VNB 25 mg/m2 on days 1,5 plus G-CSF subcutaneously on days 7-12, with cycles repeated every 21 days), or to pegylated liposomal doxorubicin/VNB (arm B: PLD/VNB, PLD 40 mg/m2 on day 1, VNB 30 mg/m2 on days 1, 15, with cycles repeated every 4 weeks). Primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of the two regimens in terms of response rate, secondarily toxicity, progression free survival and overall survival.RESULTS: One hundred and four patients have been enrolled (arm A 54, arm B 50): characteristics were well balanced between the 2 arms. Responses were as follows: arm A, 3 (5.6%) CR, 20 (37%) PR, (ORR 42.6%, 95%CI 29.3%-55.9%); arm B, 8 (16%) CR, 18 (36%) PR, (ORR 52%, 95%CI 38.2%-65.8%). Median progression free survival was 10.7 months in arm A (95% CI, 8.7-12.6), and 8.8 months in arm B (95% CI, 7.1-10.5). Median overall survival was 34.6 months in arm A (95%CI, 19.5-49.8) and 24.8 months in arm B (95%CI, 15.7-33.9). As toxicity concerns, both treatment regimens were well tolerated; myelosuppression was the dose-limiting toxicity, with G3-4 neutropenia occurring in 18.5% and 22% of the patients of arm A and B, respectively. No relevant differences in main toxic effects have been observed between the two arms, except for alopecia, more common in arm A, and cutaneous toxicity, observed only in arm B. No clinical congestive heart failures have been observed, one case of tachyarrhythmia was reported after the last EPI/VNB cycle, and two reversible ≥ 20% LVEF decreases have been observed in arm A.CONCLUSIONS: Both anthracycline- containing regimens evaluated in the present study seem to be active and with a satisfactory tolerability in anthracycline-naïve relapsed breast cancer patients.",1
In situ aromatase expression in primary tumor is associated with estrogen receptor expression but is not predictive of response to endocrine therapy in advanced breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: New, third-generation aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have proven comparable or superior to the anti-estrogen tamoxifen for treatment of estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR) positive breast cancer. AIs suppress total body and intratumoral estrogen levels. It is unclear whether in situ carcinoma cell aromatization is the primary source of estrogen production for tumor growth and whether the aromatase expression is predictive of response to endocrine therapy. Due to methodological difficulties in the determination of the aromatase protein, COX-2, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of aromatase, has been suggested as a surrogate marker for aromatase expression. METHODS: Primary tumor material was retrospectively collected from 88 patients who participated in a randomized clinical trial comparing the AI letrozole to the anti-estrogen tamoxifen for first-line treatment of advanced breast cancer. Semi-quantitative immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was performed for ER, PR, COX-2 and aromatase using Tissue Microarrays (TMAs). Aromatase was also analyzed using whole sections (WS). Kappa analysis was applied to compare association of protein expression levels. Univariate Wilcoxon analysis and the Cox-analysis were performed to evaluate time to progression (TTP) in relation to marker expression. RESULTS: Aromatase expression was associated with ER, but not with PR or COX-2 expression in carcinoma cells. Measurements of aromatase in WS were not comparable to results from TMAs. Expression of COX-2 and aromatase did not predict response to endocrine therapy. Aromatase in combination with high PR expression may select letrozole treated patients with a longer TTP. CONCLUSION: TMAs are not suitable for IHC analysis of in situ aromatase expression and we did not find COX-2 expression in carcinoma cells to be a surrogate marker for aromatase. In situ aromatase expression in tumor cells is associated with ER expression and may thus point towards good prognosis. Aromatase expression in cancer cells is not predictive of response to endocrine therapy, indicating that in situ estrogen synthesis may not be the major source of intratumoral estrogen. However, aromatase expression in combination with high PR expression may select letrozole treated patients with longer TTP. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Sub-study of trial P025 for advanced breast cancer.",0
Medroxyprogesterone acetate and lipid metabolic changes.,"Lipid metabolic changes under oral treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) were investigated in four groups of patients: group I; 10 patients aged 25-45 (mean 38) years received 50 mg MPA daily for pelvic endometriosis. Group II; 21 patients aged 55-77 (mean 62) years received 200 mg MPA daily for surgically treated endometrial carcinoma stage I. Group III; 14 praemenopausal patients aged 37-52 (mean 47) years received 1000 mg MPA daily for metastasized breast cancer. Group IV; 27 post-menopausal patients aged 53-78 (mean 68) years were treated with 1000 mg MPA daily for metastatic breast cancer as well. A fifth group of initially 86 patients aged 40-86 (mean 63) years after surgery for endometrial carcinoma stage I served as untreated control for groups II and IV. Cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were measured enzymatically lipoproteins were determined by quantitative electrophoresis and precipitation and apolipoproteins A1 and B were quantified by kinetic rate nephelometry. Whereas in patients of group I no changes of lipid and lipoprotein parameters were observed, daily oral doses of 200 mg MPA and more led to a marked fall in alpha-lipoprotein-, HDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1 levels. beta-Lipoprotein-, LDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B concentrations rose significantly in Groups III and IV. The relevance of these findings in terms of athero-genicity is discussed.",0

Tamoxifen for the prevention of breast cancer: current status of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project P-1 study.,"BACKGROUND: Initial findings from the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (P-1) demonstrated that tamoxifen reduced the risk of estrogen receptor-positive tumors and osteoporotic fractures in women at increased risk for breast cancer. Side effects of varying clinical significance were observed. The trial was unblinded because of the positive results, and follow-up continued. This report updates our initial findings. METHODS: Women (n = 13,388) were randomly assigned to receive placebo or tamoxifen for 5 years. Rates of breast cancer and other events were compared by the use of risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Estimates of the net benefit from 5 years of tamoxifen therapy were compared by age, race, and categories of predicted breast cancer risk. Statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: After 7 years of follow-up, the cumulative rate of invasive breast cancer was reduced from 42.5 per 1000 women in the placebo group to 24.8 per 1000 women in the tamoxifen group (RR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.46 to 0.70) and the cumulative rate of noninvasive breast cancer was reduced from 15.8 per 1000 women in the placebo group to 10.2 per 1000 women in the tamoxifen group (RR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.45 to 0.89). These reductions were similar to those seen in the initial report. Tamoxifen led to a 32% reduction in osteoporotic fractures (RR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.51 to 0.92). Relative risks of stroke, deep-vein thrombosis, and cataracts (which increased with tamoxifen) and of ischemic heart disease and death (which were not changed with tamoxifen) were also similar to those initially reported. Risks of pulmonary embolism were approximately 11% lower than in the original report, and risks of endometrial cancer were about 29% higher, but these differences were not statistically significant. The net benefit achieved with tamoxifen varied according to age, race, and level of breast cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the potential bias caused by the unblinding of the P-1 trial, the magnitudes of all beneficial and undesirable treatment effects of tamoxifen were similar to those initially reported, with notable reductions in breast cancer and increased risks of thromboembolic events and endometrial cancer. Readily identifiable subsets of individuals comprising 2.5 million women could derive a net benefit from the drug.",0
"Phase III trial of casopitant, a novel neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist, for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy.","PURPOSE: The purpose of this phase III trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of regimens containing casopitant, a novel neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist, for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting during the first cycle in patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Predominantly female patients (98%) diagnosed with breast cancer (96%) who were chemotherapy-naïve and scheduled to receive an anthracycline and cyclophosphamide (AC) -based regimen were enrolled onto this multinational, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled clinical trial. All patients received dexamethasone 8 mg intravenously (IV) on day 1 and oral ondansetron 8 mg twice daily on days 1 to 3. Patients were randomly assigned to a control arm (placebo), a single oral dose casopitant arm (150 mg orally [PO] on day 1), a 3-day oral casopitant arm (150 mg PO on day 1 plus 50 mg PO on days 2 to 3), or a 3-day IV/oral casopitant arm (90 mg IV on day 1 plus 50 mg PO on days 2 to 3). The primary end point was the proportion of patients achieving complete response (no vomiting/retching or rescue medications) in the first 120 hours after the initiation of MEC.RESULTS: A significantly greater proportion of patients in the single-dose oral casopitant arm, 3-day oral casopitant arm, and 3-day IV/oral casopitant arm achieved complete response (73%, 73%, and 74%, respectively) versus control (59%; P < .0001). The study did not demonstrate a reduced proportion of patients with nausea or significant nausea in those receiving casopitant. Adverse events were balanced among study arms.CONCLUSION: All casopitant regimens studied were more effective than the control regimen. Casopitant was generally well tolerated.",0
Megestrol acetate versus aminoglutethimide for metastatic breast cancer.,"In this prospective, randomized study the clinical response and toxicity of megestrol acetate (MA) and aminoglutethimide (AG) as second-line treatment in patients with metastatic breast cancer was compared. 176 patients were included, and 150 received treatment greater than 8 weeks and are evaluable for treatment response. The two groups did not differ with regard to prognostic factors. Response rate for the AG and MA groups were 34% and 31% respectively, with duration of response of 13.1 and 13.0 months. Stable disease was obtained in 33% and 35% respectively. No difference was observed in survival. Side effects occurred more frequently in the AG group (42%) than in the MA group (18%).",1
Effect of systemic adjuvant treatment on first sites of breast cancer relapse.,"Adjuvant systemic treatment for resectable breast cancer changes the natural history of the disease but provides only a small and delayed effect on survival. Evaluation of the types of first relapse avoided by available treatments may explain why effects on mortality are small and appear late during follow-up. In randomised clinical trials done by the International Breast Cancer Study Group (IBCSG) between 1978 and 1985, 2108 patients with node-positive disease received more-effective treatments (6 or more cycles of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil and prednisone; with or without tamoxifen, or tamoxifen and prednisone alone), and 722 patients received less-effective treatments (no treatment or a single cycle of chemotherapy). 3 main categories of first site of relapse were defined and evaluated by cumulative incidence analysis: local or regional, and distant soft tissue, bone, and viscera. The more-effective treatments reduced the cumulative incidence of first relapse in local or regional and distant soft tissue sites at 10 years from 36% to 18% (p = 0.0001); first relapse in bone and viscera was not altered by the more-effective treatments. These results were similar for premenopausal and postmenopausal women, and for patients with oestrogen-receptor-positive or oestrogen-receptor-negative tumours. Adjuvant systemic treatments in current use improve patient outcome mainly by reducing the incidence of first local or regional and distant soft-tissue relapses, while first recurrences in bone or viscera are influenced much less. More intensive treatments at present being tested in clinical trials might affect bone and visceral relapses and have a greater and earlier influence on survival.",0
Dynamic enhanced computed tomography values of locally advanced breast cancers predicting axilla nodal metastasis after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.,"OBJECTIVE: We investigated the differences of dynamic enhanced values between the locally advanced breast cancers with and without axillary nodal metastasis on computed tomography (CT) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS: The patients with locally advanced breast cancer (greatest diameter >5 cm before chemotherapy) who completed the preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy and ready to undertake subsequent surgery received dynamic CT. The CT enhancement values were measured on the main breast cancers in the greatest diameter, and the means of enhancement were compared between the categories with nonmetastasized and metastasized nodal axilla. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients with locally advanced breast cancers, 15 patients without and 24 with metastasized nodal axilla, were enrolled in this study. The patients with metastasized axilla nodes had significantly higher net maximal enhancement (NME) than that of patients without metastasis (mean, 52.9 +/- 23.6 vs 33.6 +/- 22.5, respectively; P = 0.02). Using the receiver operating characteristic curve, the cutoff NME in differentiating the nonmetastasized and metastasized axilla nodal status was optimally chosen at 40 Hounsfield, with sensitivity of 88.24%, specificity of 50%, positive predictive value of 71.4%, negative predictive value of 75%, and accuracy of 72.4% after chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Additional information of dynamic CT in our results reveals statistically distinguishable NME between those advanced breast cancers with or without axilla nodal metastasis after chemotherapy.",0
Carbonic anhydrase IX and response to postmastectomy radiotherapy in high-risk breast cancer: a subgroup analysis of the DBCG82 b and c trials.,"INTRODUCTION: A significant survival improvement after postmastectomy radiotherapy was identified in the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (DBCG82) b and c studies and in the British Columbia Randomized Radiation Trial. Recently, potential predictive value regarding response to postmastectomy radiotherapy was reported for carbonic anhydrase (CA) IX in a study (reported in abstract form) that included 160 patients. The purpose of the present study was to examine the importance of CA IX to response to postmastectomy radiotherapy in the larger scaled DBCG82 b and c studies.METHODS: The DBCG82 b and c studies included 3,083 high-risk Danish breast cancer patients. The women were randomly assigned to postmastectomy radiotherapy plus systemic therapy (cyclophosfamide, methotrexate and fluorouracil in premenopausal women; and tamoxifen in postmenopausal women) or to systemic therapy alone. Cores from invasive tumour-containing paraffin blocks from 1,000 patients (more than seven nodes surgically removed) were transferred to tissue microarrays. Tissue microarray sections were stained immunohistochemically for CA IX (M75). The median follow up for patients remaining alive was 17 years. Clinical end-points were loco-regional recurrence, distant metastases, disease-specific survival and overall survival. Statistical analyses included kappa statistics, chi2 or exact tests, Kaplan-Meier probability plots, Log-rank test and Cox regression analyses.RESULTS: CA IX was assessable in 945 cores. The percentage of tumours positive for CA IX was 16% (> or = 10% invasive tumour staining). CA IX was not an independent prognostic marker for survival, distant metastases, or locoregional recurrence in the subgroup of 945 patients or within either of the two randomization arms. In subgroup analyses, however, CA IX was an independent prognostic marker for overall survival among postmenopausal women (P = 0.001), women with one to three positive nodes (P = 0.02) and hormone receptor positive women (P = 0.001). Fifteen-year probabilities of overall survival were improved by 9% and 7% after postmastectomy radiotherapy for the subgroups of CA IX negative and CA IX positive patients, respectively.CONCLUSION: Within this series of 945 high-risk premenopausal and postmenopausal women, positivity for CA IX was not overall an independent prognostic marker for survival; only in subgroup analyses was it found to have prognostic value. The improvement in 15-year survival after postmastectomy radiotherapy was of similar magnitude in the two subgroups of CA IX positive and CA IX negative patients.",0
"Obesity, tamoxifen use, and outcomes in women with estrogen receptor-positive early-stage breast cancer.","BACKGROUND: Obesity is associated with both increased breast cancer risk and poorer prognosis after disease onset. However, little is known about the effect of obesity on treatment efficacy. We evaluated the association of obesity with outcomes and with tamoxifen efficacy in women with early-stage, hormone-responsive breast cancer participating in a multicenter cancer cooperative group clinical trial. METHODS: The cohort consisted of 3385 women enrolled in National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) protocol B-14, a randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating tamoxifen for lymph node-negative, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. Hazards of breast cancer recurrence, contralateral breast tumors, other new primary cancers, and several mortality endpoints were evaluated in relation to body mass index (BMI), using statistical modeling to adjust for other prognostic factors. Median follow-up time was 166 months. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: The hazard of breast cancer recurrence was the same among obese (BMI > or =30.0 kg/m2) women as compared with underweight and normal-weight women (BMI <25.0; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.80 to 1.18). Contralateral breast cancer hazard was higher in obese women than in underweight/normal-weight women (HR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.10 to 2.25), as was the risk of other primary cancers (HR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.16 to 2.24). Compared with normal-weight women, obese women had greater all-cause mortality (HR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.12 to 1.54) and greater risk of deaths due to causes unrelated to breast cancer (HR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.15 to 1.92). Breast cancer mortality was not statistically significantly increased for obese women (HR = 1.20, 95% CI = 0.97 to 1.49). Tamoxifen reduced breast cancer recurrence and mortality, regardless of BMI. CONCLUSIONS: For women with lymph node-negative, ER-positive breast cancer, obesity was not associated with a material increase in recurrence risk or a change in tamoxifen efficacy. However, because obesity was associated with increased risks of contralateral breast cancer, of other primary cancers, and of overall mortality, it may influence long-term outcomes for breast cancer survivors.",0
Skin toxic effects of polyethylene glycol-coated liposomal doxorubicin.,"OBJECTIVES: To record the profile of toxic effects of polyethylene glycol-coated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride (Doxil) to the skin, and to evaluate whether the long circulation pattern and enhanced accumulation of liposomes in specific skin sites will result in any unique presentations. DESIGN: Patients were accrued in the frame of dose-range-finding studies that examine the toxic effects and antitumor activity of Doxil therapy in metastatic breast and prostate cancers. All patients receiving Doxil were instructed to report any skin eruption or discomfort. Skin examination was performed on a regular basis at every cycle of Doxil therapy and after specific complaints. SETTING: Outpatient day care unit of the oncology institute of a secondary-referral medical center. PATIENTS: Sixty patients (45 women and 15 men). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A basic severity scale of I through IV was adopted for toxic effects to the skin, based on National Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria. RESULTS: The following 4 patterns of skin eruptions were encountered: hand-foot syndrome (n = 24), diffuse follicular rash (n = 6), intertrigolike eruption (n = 5), and new formation of melanotic macules (n = 3). Another major toxic effect of Doxil was stomatitis, which was found to be the dose-limiting factor for the maximal single dose. Alopecia and extravasation injuries did not occur. CONCLUSIONS: The profile of toxic effects of Doxil to the skin reflects its unique pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution. These skin reactions vary significantly from those associated with doxorubicin in non-liposome-encapsulated form.",0
Decreased toxicity and increased efficacy of cancer chemotherapy using the pineal hormone melatonin in metastatic solid tumour patients with poor clinical status.,"Melatonin (MLT) has been proven to counteract chemotherapy toxicity, by acting as an anti-oxidant agent, and to promote apoptosis of cancer cells, so enhancing chemotherapy cytotoxicity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of concomitant MLT administration on toxicity and efficacy of several chemotherapeutic combinations in advanced cancer patients with poor clinical status. The study included 250 metastatic solid tumour patients (lung cancer, 104; breast cancer, 77; gastrointestinal tract neoplasms, 42; head and neck cancers, 27), who were randomized to receive MLT (20 mg/day orally every day) plus chemotherapy, or chemotherapy alone. Chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin (CDDP) plus etoposide or gemcitabine alone for lung cancer, doxorubicin alone, mitoxantrone alone or paclitaxel alone for breast cancer, 5-FU plus folinic acid for gastro-intestinal tumours and 5-FU plus CDDP for head and neck cancers. The 1-year survival rate and the objective tumour regression rate were significantly higher in patients concomitantly treated with MLT than in those who received chemotherapy (CT) alone (tumour response rate: 42/124 CT + MLT versus 19/126 CT only, P < 0.001; 1-year survival: 63/124 CT + MLT versus 29/126 CT only, P < 0.001). Moreover, the concomitant administration of MLT significantly reduced the frequency of thrombocytopenia, neurotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, stomatitis and asthenia. This study indicates that the pineal hormone MLT may enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy and reduce its toxicity, at least in advanced cancer patients of poor clinical status.",0
Validation of gene signatures that predict the response of breast cancer to neoadjuvant chemotherapy: a substudy of the EORTC 10994/BIG 00-01 clinical trial.,"BACKGROUND: We have previously described gene-expression signatures that predict growth inhibitory and cytotoxic effects of common chemotherapeutic drugs in vitro. The aim of this study was to confirm the validity of these gene-expression signatures in a large series of patients with oestrogen-receptor-negative breast tumours who were treated in a phase III neoadjuvant clinical trial.METHODS: This trial compares a non-taxane regimen (fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide [FEC] for six cycles) with a taxane regimen (docetaxel for three cycles followed by epirubicin plus docetaxel [TET] for three cycles) in women with oestrogen-receptor-negative breast cancer. The primary endpoint of the study is the difference in progression-free survival based on TP53 status and will be reported later. Predicting response with gene signatures was a planned secondary endpoint of the trial and is reported here. Pathological complete response, defined as complete disappearance of the tumour with no more than a few scattered tumour cells detected by the pathologist in the resection specimen, was used to assess chemosensitivity. RNA was prepared from sections of frozen biopsies taken at diagnosis and hybridised to Affymetrix X3P microarrays. In-vitro single-agent drug sensitivity signatures were combined to obtain FEC and TET regimen-specific signatures. This study is registered on the clinical trials site of the US National Cancer Institute website http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT00017095.FINDINGS: Of 212 patients with oestrogen-receptor-negative tumours assessed, 87 patients were excluded. 125 oestrogen-receptor-negative tumours (55 that showed pathological complete responses) were tested: 66 in the FEC group (28 that showed pathological complete responses) and 59 in the TET group (27 that showed pathological complete responses). The regimen-specific signatures significantly predicted pathological complete response in patients treated with the appropriate regimen (p<0.0001). The FEC predictor had a sensitivity of 96% (27 of 28 patients [95% CI 82-99]), specificity of 66% (25 of 38 patients [50-79]), positive predictive value (PPV) of 68% (27 of 40 patients [52-80]), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 96% (25 of 26 patients [81-99]). The TET predictor had a sensitivity of 93% (25 of 27 patients [77-98]), specificity 69% (22 of 32 patients [51-82]), PPV of 71% (25 of 35 patients [55-84]), and NPV of 92% (22 of 24 patients [74-98]). Analysis of tumour size, grade, nodal status, age, and regimen-specific signatures showed that the genomic signatures were the only independent variables predicting pathological complete response at p<0.01. Selection of patients with these signatures would increase the proportion of patients with pathological complete responses from 44% to around 70% in the patients studied here.INTERPRETATION: We have validated the use of regimen-specific drug sensitivity signatures in the context of a multicentre randomised trial. The high NPV of both signatures may allow early selection of patients with breast cancer who should be considered for trials with new drugs.",0
Aromatase expression and outcomes in the P024 neoadjuvant endocrine therapy trial.,"BACKGROUND: Expression of aromatase by malignant breast epithelial cells and/or the surrounding stroma implies local estrogen production that could influence the outcome of endocrine therapy for breast cancer.METHODS: A validated immunohistochemical assay for aromatase was applied to samples from the P024 neoadjuvant endocrine therapy trial that compared tamoxifen and letrozole. The presence of aromatase expression by tumor or stromal cells was correlated with tumor response, treatment induced changes in proliferation index (Ki67), relapse-free survival (RFS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS).RESULTS: Tumor and stromal aromatase expression were highly correlated (P = 0.0001). Tumor cell aromatase, as a semi-continuous score, also correlated with smaller tumor size at presentation (P = 0.01) higher baseline ER Allred score (P = 0.006) and lower Ki67 levels (P = 0.003). There was no significant relationship with clinical response or treatment-induced changes in Ki67. However, in a Cox multivariable model that incorporated a post-treatment tumor profile (pathological T stage, N stage, Ki67 and ER status of the surgical specimen), the presence of tumor aromatase expression at baseline sample remained a favorable independent prognostic biomarker for both RFS (P = 0.01, HR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2-4.6 for absent expression) and BCSS (P = 0.008, HR 3.76, 95% CI 1.4-10.0).CONCLUSIONS: Autocrine estrogen synthesis may be most characteristic of smaller, more indolent and ER-rich breast cancers with lower baseline growth rates. However, response to endocrine treatment may not depend on whether the estrogenic stimulus has a local versus systemic source.",0
Role of axillary clearance after a tumor-positive sentinel node in the administration of adjuvant therapy in early breast cancer.,"PURPOSE The After Mapping of the Axilla: Radiotherapy or Surgery? (AMAROS) phase III study compares axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and axillary radiation therapy (ART) in early breast cancer patients with tumor-positive sentinel nodes. In the ART arm, the extent of nodal involvement remains unknown, which could have implications on the administration of adjuvant therapy. In this preliminary analysis, we studied the influence of random assignment to ALND or ART on the choice for adjuvant treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS In the first 2,000 patients enrolled in the AMAROS trial, we analyzed the administration of adjuvant systemic therapy. Multivariate analysis was used to assess variables affecting the administration of adjuvant chemotherapy. Adjuvant therapy was applied according to institutional guidelines. Results Of 2,000 patients, 566 patients had a positive sentinel node and were treated per random assignment. There was no significant difference in the administration of adjuvant systemic therapy. In the ALND and ART arms, 58% (175 of 300) and 61% (162 of 266) of the patients, respectively, received chemotherapy. Endocrine therapy was administered in 78% (235 of 300) of the patients in the ALND arm and in 76% (203 of 266) of the patients in the ART arm. Treatment arm was not a significant factor in the decision, and no interactions between treatment arm and other factors were observed. Multivariate analysis showed that age, tumor grade, multifocality, and size of the sentinel node metastasis significantly affected the administration of chemotherapy. Within the ALND arm, the extent of nodal involvement remained not significant in a sensitivity multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION Absence of knowledge regarding the extent of nodal involvement in the ART arm appears to have no major impact on the administration of adjuvant therapy.",0
Sentinel node biopsy after primary chemotherapy in breast cancer: a note of caution from results of ABCSG-14.,"Over the past years, experience has been increasing with lymphatic mapping and sentinel node biopsy (SNB) after preoperative chemotherapy for breast cancer, with a wide range of results reported in the literature and final conclusions on the diagnostic value and clinical consequences of this sequential approach still missing. Between 1999 and 2002, the Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group (ABCSG) conducted a prospective randomized multicenter trial comparing three versus six preoperative cycles of epirubicin/docetaxel + granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for operable breast cancer. Of the 292 patients recruited to the trial overall, 111 were enrolled in a prospective subprotocol for performing LM and SNB in addition to obligatory axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) after PC. SNB after PC identified at least one sentinel node in 100 of 111 patients (identification rate 90%). In six cases, a false-negative SN was identified, resulting in a false-negative rate of 13% (6 of 47). We only found little correlation between patients and tumor characteristics and the identification rate or false-negative rate. Lymphatic mapping and SNB after primary chemotherapy failed to predict histologic infiltration of the sentinel node with sufficient sensitivity. The routine use of SNB after primary chemotherapy should therefore be discouraged.",0

Effect of virtual reality on time perception in patients receiving chemotherapy.,"PURPOSE: Virtual reality (VR) during chemotherapy has resulted in an elapsed time compression effect, validating the attention diversion capabilities of VR. Using the framework of the pacemaker-accumulator cognitive model of time perception, this study explored the influence of age, gender, state anxiety, fatigue, and cancer diagnosis in predicting the difference between actual time elapsed during receipt of intravenous chemotherapy while immersed in a VR environment versus patient's retrospective estimates of time elapsed during this treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This secondary analysis from three studies yielded a pooled sample of N = 137 participants with breast, lung, or colon cancer. Each study employed a crossover design requiring two matched intravenous chemotherapy treatments, with participants randomly assigned to receive VR during one treatment. Regressions modeled the effect of demographic variables, diagnosis, and Piper Fatigue Scale and State Anxiety Inventory scores on the difference between actual and estimated time elapsed during chemotherapy with VR. RESULTS: In a forward regression model, three predictors (diagnosis, gender, and anxiety) explained a significant portion of the variability for altered time perception (F=5.06, p = 0.0008). Diagnosis was the strongest predictor; individuals with breast and colon cancer perceived time passed more quickly. CONCLUSIONS: VR is a noninvasive intervention that can make chemotherapy treatments more tolerable. Women with breast cancer are more likely and lung cancer patients less likely to experience altered time perception during VR (a possible indicator of effectiveness for this distraction intervention). Understanding factors that predict responses to interventions can help clinicians tailor coping strategies to meet each patient's needs.",0
"Prevention of delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting after moderately high to highly emetogenic chemotherapy: comparison of ondansetron, prochlorperazine, and dexamethasone.","The purpose of this article is to assess the comparative antiemetic efficacy of prochlorperazine, ondansetron, and dexamethasone in the prevention of delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) after moderately high to highly emetogenic chemotherapy. Cancer patients (n = 232) receiving moderately high to highly emetogenic chemotherapy were randomized to 1 of 3 treatments: 15 mg prochlorperazine spansules twice daily; 8 mg ondansetron tablets twice daily; or 8 mg dexamethasone tablets twice daily on days 2 through 5. All patients received 24 mg ondansetron and 20 mg dexamethasone orally before chemotherapy. Daily assessment (days 1 through 5) included the number of episodes of retching and vomiting, severity of nausea, restlessness, difficulty concentrating and fatigue, treatment satisfaction, and overall quality of life (measured using a 10-cm VAS). The Functional Living Index-Emesis (FLIE) was completed on day 5. Other side effects attributed to antiemetic therapy were recorded daily. For acute CINV, total control, defined as no vomiting, retching, nausea <1 cm on a 10-cm visual analog scale, and no administration of rescue medications, was achieved in 78% in the overall group and was not significantly different in the patients randomized to the 3 treatment arms for delayed CINV. Delayed CINV was reported by 43% to 57% of patients, with the highest incidence reported on day 3. For delayed CINV, patients receiving prochlorperazine reported the lowest average nausea score on days 2 to 5, whereas patients receiving ondansetron reported the highest nausea score (P = 0.05). No statistically significant differences in CINV or side effects of antiemetic therapy were noted between treatment groups on days 2 to 5. For patients similar to those included in this study, there does not appear to be a clinically important difference in efficacy, adverse effects, or treatment satisfaction among dexamethasone, prochlorperazine, and ondansetron in the doses used in these delayed CINV regimens on days 2 to 5 in this study.",0
Adjuvant tamoxifen therapy for early stage breast cancer and second primary malignancies. Stockholm Breast Cancer Study Group.,"BACKGROUND: Tamoxifen is being increasingly used for the treatment of breast cancer and is undergoing study for the primary prevention of breast cancer. However, concerns have been raised that the drug may increase the incidence of new primary malignancies, such as endometrial, liver, and colorectal cancers. PURPOSE: Our goal was to assess the carcinogenic risks associated with long-term use of tamoxifen in women with early stage breast cancer. METHODS: The incidence of new primary cancers among 2729 women participants of the Stockholm Trial was determined at a median follow-up of 9 years. In this trial, after primary surgery, postmenopausal patients aged less than 71 years with unilateral invasive breast cancer were randomly allocated to receive either 2 years of adjuvant tamoxifen (40 mg daily) or no adjuvant endocrine therapy. Information on second cancers was obtained by retrospective linkage to the Swedish Cancer Registry. To increase statistical power, a joint analysis of the incidence of endometrial and gastrointestinal cancers was performed in the following three major studies in Scandinavia evaluating adjuvant tamoxifen therapy: the Stockholm Trial, the Danish Breast Cancer Group Trial, and the South-Swedish Trial. These studies included a total of 4914 patients with a median follow-up of 8-9 years. All P values were calculated from two-tailed tests of statistical significance. RESULTS: In the Stockholm Trial, there was a statistically significant (P = .008) reduction in the incidence of second primary cancers in the contralateral breast among the tamoxifen-treated patients. However, there was a nearly sixfold increase in endometrial cancers (P < .001) and a threefold increase in gastrointestinal cancers in the tamoxifen-treated patients. The results of the joint studies showed a statistically significant increase in endometrial cancers among the tamoxifen-treated patients (relative risk [RR] = 4.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.9-8.9). There was also an excess of gastrointestinal cancers associated with tamoxifen. Most of this excess involved colorectal cancers (RR = 1.9; 95% CI = 1.1-3.3) and stomach cancer (RR = 3.2; 95% CI = 0.9-11.7). There was no substantial increase in any other type of gastrointestinal cancer (e.g., liver cancer) among the tamoxifen-treated patients. CONCLUSION: The endometrium and gastrointestinal organs may be target sites for tamoxifen-induced carcinogenesis in humans. IMPLICATIONS: The increased incidence of colorectal and stomach cancers reported here should be regarded as tentative until supported by long-term data from a larger number of tamoxifen trials. Also, appropriate surveillance of cancer incidence is warranted for the protection of participants enrolled in current tamoxifen chemoprevention trials.",1
Doxorubicin followed by docetaxel versus docetaxel followed by doxorubicin in the adjuvant treatment of node positive breast cancer: results of a feasibility study.,"BACKGROUND: Doxorubicin (A) and Docetaxel (T) are amongst the most active agents in breast cancer treatment. The impact of drug sequencing is an issue still under evaluation. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility and tolerability of two A and T-based sequential regimens, in which the sequence of drug administration was reversed. METHODS: The study included patients pts aged < or = 70 years, with operable node positive breast cancer. Two consecutive groups of patients received one of the following regimens: 1) Sequential A-->T-->CMF: Doxorubicin 75 mg/m2, i.v., day 1, q3wks x 3 cycles, followed by Docetaxel 100 mg/m2, i.v., day 1, q3wks x 3 cycles, followed by i.v. CMF days 1 and 8 q4wks x 3 cycles. 2) Sequential T-->A-->CMF: same doses for Doxorubicin and Docetaxel but reverse sequence of administration, followed by oral CMF (CPA 100 mg/m2, oral, days 1-14 + MTX 40 mg/m2, i.v., days 1 and 8 + 5FU 600 mg/m2, i.v., days 1 and 8, q4wks). An analysis of treatment administration and toxicity was performed for the first six cycles of CT, in the two treatment groups. RESULTS: Group 1 with 20 patients and group 2 with 14 patients were balanced in terms of patient and tumour characteristics. There was one early treatment discontinuation in each group due to toxicity (one allergic and one skin reaction to docetaxel). Median relative dose intensity was 100% for both drugs in both groups. The most relevant side effects were (overall incidence, group 1 vs group 2): Myalgia: 45% vs 72%; Arthralgia: 15% vs 57%; Skin: 35% vs 57%; Neurosensory: 55% vs 64%; Stomatitis 65% vs 36%; conjunctivitis 25% vs 57%; Neutropenic Fever 20% vs 21% and Fatigue 80% vs 93%. Grade 3/4 adverse events' rate was low in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: 1) Both sequences were estimated feasible due to the optimal treatment administration and limited incidence of G3-G4 side effects. 2) The concomitant use of lenograstin might partially explain the reported incidence of myalgia and arthralgia. 3) No conclusion can be drawn on the most tolerable regimen due to the limited number of patients.",1
Assessment of residual tumour by FDG-PET: conventional imaging and clinical examination following primary chemotherapy of large and locally advanced breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this was to evaluate FDG-PET (2-(fluorine-18)-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography) for assessment of residual tumour after primary chemotherapy of large and locally advanced breast cancer in comparison with conventional imaging modalities.METHODS: In a prospective multicentre trial, 99 patients underwent one or more breast imaging modalities before surgery in addition to clinical examination, namely, FDG-PET (n=89), mammography (n=47), ultrasound (n=46), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (n=46). The presence of residual tumour by conventional imaging, dichotomised as positive or negative, and the level of FDG uptake (standardised uptake values, SUV) were compared with histopathology, which served as the reference standard. Patients with no residual tumour or only small microscopic foci of residual tumour were classified as having minimal residual disease and those with extensive microscopic and macroscopic residual tumour tissue were classified as having gross residual disease.RESULTS: By applying a threshold SUV of 2.0, the sensitivity of FDG-PET for residual tumour was 32.9% (specificity, 87.5%) and increased to 57.5% (specificity, 62.5%) at a threshold SUV of 1.5. Conventional imaging modalities were more sensitive in identifying residual tumour, but had a low corresponding specificity; sensitivity and specificity were as follows: MRI 97.6 and 40.0%, mammography 92.5 and 57.1%, ultrasound 92.0 and 37.5%, respectively. Breast MRI provided the highest accuracy (91.3%), whereas FDG-PET had the lowest accuracy (42.7%).CONCLUSIONS: FDG-PET does not provide an accurate assessment of residual tumour after primary chemotherapy of breast cancer. Magnetic resonance imaging offers the highest sensitivity, but all imaging modalities have distinct limitations in the assessment of residual tumour tissue when compared with histopathology.",0
Randomized trial of diethylstilbestrol vs. tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer. An updated analysis.,"One hundred fifty-one postmenopausal women with progressive metastatic breast cancer and no prior hormonal therapy were treated with either diethylstilbestrol (DES) or tamoxifen (TAM). One hundred forty-three eligible patients were followed until death or for a minimum of 14.1 years on the DES arm or 16.7 years on the TAM arm. The overall objective response was 42% for DES and 33% for TAM (p = 0.31) and the median duration of response was 11.8 months for DES and 9.9 months for TAM (p = 0.38). Duration of response and progression-free survival were not found to be significantly different between DES and TAM (p = 0.32 and 0.65, respectively). The median survival was 3.0 years for DES vs. 2.4 years for TAM. The 5-year survival was 35% for the DES arm and 16% for the TAM arm. Survival was significantly better for women on DES than for women on TAM (adjusted p = 0.039). Review of records did not show any difference in pattern of treatment failure or subsequent treatments in the DES and TAM arms. Treatment with DES was more commonly associated with toxicity such as nausea, edema, vaginal bleeding, and cardiac problems, whereas hot flashes were commonly seen with TAM therapy. The initial treatment with DES is associated with increased survival. The basis of this survival advantage is not known. TAM still is the preferred agent in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, but this trial underscores the fact that estrogens have activity and remain in the armamentarium for treatment of selected patients with metastatic breast cancer.",0
The effect of tamoxifen on PCNA expression in fibroadenomas.,"For almost three decades, tamoxifen has been used in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. It has also proven effective in the chemoprophylaxis of this disease and in the treatment of cyclic mastalgia. Since a fibroadenoma is a benign hormone-dependent neoplasm which contains estrogen receptor (ER) levels higher than in the mammary lobule, an evaluation of the effect of this drug on the proliferative activity of both the epithelium and the stroma of fibroadenomas in premenopausal women following the administration of 10 or 20 mg/day over 22 days was proposed. Forty women with fibroadenoma were selected for a randomized double-blind trial. They had regular menstrual cycles and had received neither hormones nor become pregnant 12 months prior to this study. Patients were divided into three groups: A (n = 14; placebo), B (n = 13; tamoxifen 10 mg/day), and C (n = 13; tamoxifen 20 mg/day). The treatment was initiated on the first day of their menstrual cycle and the surgeries were performed on the 22nd day. Estradiol, progesterone, and steroid hormone binding globulin (SHBG) were measured twice. The first measurement was performed on the 22nd day of the previous menstrual cycle and the second one was performed on the day of surgery. The fibroadenoma was fixed in 10% formaldehyde solution and stained with hematoxylin and eosin and then processed through immunohistochemical reaction (PC-10, DAKO code number M879, Denmark A/S). The immunoexpression of the proliferative cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) of at least 500 epithelial and 500 stromal cells was evaluated. Such cells were interactively counted using the Kontron Imaging System KS-300 computerized analysis system, with x 400 magnification. As to PCNA expression in the fibroadenomas' epithelium, the average percentage of stained nuclei in groups A, B, and C was 25.2, 19.3, and 18.0, respectively. However, no significant difference was found in the variance analysis of these data (p = 0.168). As to the study of the fibroadenomas' stroma, the average percentage of stained nuclei found in groups A, B, and C was 32.4, 23.2, and 18.4, respectively. The variance analysis (p = 0.031) and Fisher's multiple comparison test (1.39; 26.67 confidence interval [CI]) confirmed that the number of PCNA-expressing nuclei in the stroma was significantly lower in group C (20 mg/day) compared to group A (control). However, there was no significant difference between group B (10 mg/day) and group C (20 mg/day). It was found that tamoxifen reduced the expression of PCNA in the epithelium and the stroma of the fibroadenoma. However, the effect was only statistically significant in the stroma when a 20 mg/day dose was administered.",0
"HER2, TOP2A, and TIMP-1 and responsiveness to adjuvant anthracycline-containing chemotherapy in high-risk breast cancer patients.","PURPOSE To evaluate whether the combination of HER2 with TIMP-1 (HT) or TOP2A with TIMP-1 (2T) more accurately identifies patients who benefit from cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and fluorouracil (CEF) compared with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) than these markers do when analyzed individually. PATIENTS AND METHODS The Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (DBCG) 89D trial randomly assigned 980 high-risk Danish breast cancer patients to CMF or CEF. Archival tumor tissue was analyzed TIMP-1, and HER2-negative and TIMP-1 immunoreactive tumors were classified as HT nonresponsive and otherwise HT responsive. Similarly, the 2T panel was constructed by combining TOP2A and TIMP-1; tumors with normal TOP2A status and TIMP-1 immunoreactivity were classified as 2T-nonresponsive and otherwise 2T-responsive. Results In total, 623 tumors were available for analysis, of which 154 lacked TIMP-1 immunoreactivity, 188 were HER2 positive, and 139 had a TOP2A aberration. HT status was a statistically significant predictor of benefit from CEF compared with CMF (P(interaction) = .036 for invasive disease-free survival [IDFS] and .047 for overall survival [OS]). The 269 (43%) patients with a 2T-responsive profile had a significant reduction in IDFS events (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.69; P < .001) and OS events (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.77; P < .001). 2T status was a highly significant predictor of benefit from CEF compared with CMF (P(interaction) < .0001 for IDFS and .004 for OS). CONCLUSION The 2T profile is a more accurate predictor of incremental benefit from anthracycline-containing chemotherapy than HER2, TIMP-1, or TOP2A individually, and compared with these, 2T classifies a larger proportion of patients as sensitive to anthracyclines.",0
Metronomic low-dose oral cyclophosphamide and methotrexate plus or minus thalidomide in metastatic breast cancer: antitumor activity and biological effects.,"BACKGROUND: We previously demonstrated efficacy and impact on serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) for metronomic cyclophosphamide (C) and methotrexate (M) in patients with breast cancer. New metronomic schedules were investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced breast cancer were randomized to receive oral C (50 mg daily) and M (2.5 mg twice daily on days 1 and 4) (arm A) or the same regimen plus thalidomide (200 mg daily) (arm B). RESULTS: The mean VEGF level decreased from 378.9 (+/-274.4) pg/ml at baseline to 305.9 (+/-203.6) pg/ml at 2 months (P<0.001), with similar change with respect to baseline in both arms. In 171 evaluable patients we observed three complete remissions (CR) in both arms A and B, 15 partial remission (PR) in arm A and seven in arm B, for an overall response of 20.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 12.9% to 31%] in arm A and 11.8% (95% CI 5.8% to 20.6%) in arm B. The clinical benefit (CR+PR+SD>or=24 weeks) was 41.5% for both arms. Toxicity was generally mild. Higher neurological toxicity (2% versus 60%; P<0.0001) and constipation (8% versus 51%; P<0.0001) was observed in arm B. CONCLUSIONS: Metronomic low-dose CM induced a drop in VEGF, and was effective and minimally toxic. The addition of thalidomide did not improve results.",1
"Tamoxifen and chemotherapy for lymph node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.","BACKGROUND: The B-20 study of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) was conducted to determine whether chemotherapy plus tamoxifen would be of greater benefit than tamoxifen alone in the treatment of patients with axillary lymph node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. METHODS: Eligible patients (n = 2306) were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups following surgery. A total of 771 patients with follow-up data received tamoxifen alone; 767 received methotrexate, fluorouracil, and tamoxifen (MFT); and 768 received cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil, and tamoxifen (CMFT). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate disease-free survival, distant disease-free survival, and survival. Reported P values are two-sided. RESULTS: Through 5 years of follow-up, chemotherapy plus tamoxifen resulted in significantly better disease-free survival than tamoxifen alone (90% for MFT versus 85% for tamoxifen [P = .01]; 89% for CMFT versus 85% for tamoxifen [P = .001]). A similar benefit was observed in both distant disease-free survival (92% for MFT versus 87% for tamoxifen [P = .008]; 91% for CMFT versus 87% for tamoxifen [P = .006]) and survival (97% for MFT versus 94% for tamoxifen [P = .05]; 96% for CMFT versus 94% for tamoxifen [P = .03]). Compared with tamoxifen alone, MFT and CMFT reduced the risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence after lumpectomy and the risk of recurrence at other local, regional, and distant sites. Risk of treatment failure was reduced after both types of chemotherapy, regardless of tumor size, tumor estrogen or progesterone receptor level, or patient age; however, the reduction was greatest in patients aged 49 years or less. No subgroup of patients evaluated in this study failed to benefit from chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this and other NSABP studies indicate that patients with breast cancer who meet NSABP protocol criteria, regardless of age, lymph node status, tumor size, or estrogen receptor status, are candidates for chemotherapy.",1
The toxicity of radiotherapy following high-dose chemotherapy with peripheral blood stem cell support in high-risk breast cancer: a preliminary analysis.,"High-dose chemotherapy with autologous bone marrow and/or peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) support is increasingly employed in the adjuvant treatment of high-risk breast cancer. Subsequent radiotherapy has been reported to be associated with morbidity and mortality resulting from pulmonary toxicity. In addition, the course of radiation therapy may be hampered by excess myelosuppression. The aim of this study was to investigate the contribution to radiation-induced toxicity of a high-dose chemotherapy regimen (CTC) that incorporates cyclophosphamide, thiotepa and carboplatin, in patients with high-risk breast cancer. In two randomised single institution studies, 70 consecutive patients received anthracycline-containing adjuvant chemotherapy (FEC: 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide) followed by radiotherapy to achieve maximal local control. Of these patients, 34 received high-dose CTC with autologous PBSC support. All patients tolerated the full radiation dose in the planned time schedule. Radiation pneumonitis was observed in 5 patients (7%), 4 of whom had undergone high-dose chemotherapy (P = 0.38). All 5 responded favourably to prednisone. Fatal toxicities were not observed. Myelosuppression did not require interruption or untimely discontinuation of the radiotherapy, although significant reductions in median nadir platelet counts and haemoglobin levels were observed in patients who had received high-dose chemotherapy (P = 0.0001). The median nadir of WBC counts was mildly but significantly decreased during radiotherapy (P = 0.01). Red blood cell or platelet transfusions were rarely indicated. Adequate radiotherapy for breast cancer can be safely administered after high-dose CTC with autologous PBSC support. Radiation-induced myelotoxicity is clearly enhanced following CTC, but this is of little clinical significance. Radiation pneumonitis after high-dose therapy may occur more often in patients with a history of lung disease or after a relatively high radiation dose to the chest wall. Other high-dose regimens, particularly those incorporating drugs with known pulmonary toxicity (such as BCNU), may predispose patients to radiation pneumonitis.",0
"Manganese superoxide dismutase polymorphism, treatment-related toxicity and disease-free survival in SWOG 8897 clinical trial for breast cancer.","To date, the few studies of associations between a functional polymorphism in the oxidative stress-related gene manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) and breast cancer survival have been inconsistent. In a homogeneous patient population from a large cooperative group trial Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) 8897, we evaluated this polymorphism in relation to both treatment-related toxicity and disease-free survival (DFS). Among 458 women who received cyclophosphamide-containing adjuvant chemotherapy, those with variant C alleles, related to higher antioxidant activity, experienced less grade 3-4 neutropenia (OR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.29-0.92) but had worse DFS (HR = 1.59, 95% CI = 0.99-2.55) than women with TT genotypes. No associations were observed among 874 women who were followed without adjuvant therapy. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that women with higher SOD2 antioxidant activity may experience less treatment-related toxicity but shorter time to disease recurrence or death after breast cancer adjuvant chemotherapy, supporting the modifying effects of oxidative stress-related enzymes on cancer treatment toxicity and efficacy.",0
Anisotropic diffusion tensor applied to temporal mammograms: an application to breast cancer risk assessment.,"Breast density is considered a structural property of a mammogram that can change in various ways explaining different effects of medicinal treatments. The aim of the present work is to provide a framework for obtaining more accurate and sensitive measurements of breast density changes related to specific effects like Hormonal Replacement Therapy (HRT) and aging. Given effect-grouped patient data, we demonstrated how the diffusion tensor and its coherence features computed in an anatomically oriented breast coordinate system followed by statistical learning scheme provides non subjective and reproducible measure, as compared to the traditional BIRADS and computer aided percent density measure. We also demonstrate how orientation of breast tissue changes in temporal study. This framework facilitates radiologist to assess breast tissue change and guide them to evaluate individual risk of having breast cancer.",0
Single-injection paravertebral block before general anesthesia enhances analgesia after breast cancer surgery with and without associated lymph node biopsy.,"Paravertebral block (PVB) seems to decrease postoperative pain and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) after breast surgery, but the studies have not been placebo controlled. We studied 60 patients scheduled for breast cancer surgery randomly given single-injection PVB at T3 with bupivacaine 5 mg/mL (1.5 mg/kg) or saline before general anesthesia. The patient and attending investigators were blinded; the PVB or the sham block was performed behind a curtain by an anesthesiologist not involved in the study. The patients given PVB with bupivacaine needed 40% less IV opioid medication (primary outcome variable) in the postanesthesia care unit, had a longer latency to the first opioid dose, and had less pain at rest after 24 h than the control patients (P < 0.01). They also had less PONV in the postanesthesia care unit (P < 0.05), were less sedated until 90 min (P < 0.05), and performed better in the digit symbol substitution test at 90 min and the ocular coordination test 60-120 min after surgery (P < 0.05). The average peak bupivacaine plasma concentration was 750 ng/mL. One patient had bilateral convulsions immediately after bupivacaine injection. We conclude that PVB before general anesthesia for breast cancer surgery reduced postoperative pain, opioid consumption, and occurrence of PONV and improved recovery from anesthesia.",0
"Randomized placebo-controlled trial of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating-factor support for dose-intensive cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and cisplatin.","This is a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating-factor (GM-CSF) after dose-intensive cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and cisplatin (DICEP). Fifty-six patients with lymphoma or breast carcinoma were randomized to receive GM-CSF 250 microg/m2 or placebo subcutaneously (SC) every 12 hr after each course of DICEP until recovery of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1.5 x 10(9)/L. Each patient was to receive three courses of DICEP. There were 28 patients in each group. The median duration of ANC below 0.5 x 10(9)/L was 10 versus 12 days for Course 1 (P = 0.010), 10 versus 12 days for Course 2 (P = 0.248), and 16.5 versus 15 days for Course 3 (P = 0.126); platelet counts below 20 x 10(9)/L was 4 versus 4 days for Course 1 (P = 0.586), 8.5 versus 7 days for Course 2 (P = 0.013), and 23.5 versus 10.5 days for Course 3 (P = 0.104); hospitalization for patients readmitted with cytopenic fever were 4 versus 8 days for Course 1 (P = 0.035); 7 versus 6 days for Course 2 (P = 0.692); and 8 versus 12 days for Course 3 (P = 0.884) in the GM-CSF and placebo group, respectively. GM-CSF significantly shortens the duration of neutropenia and readmission only during the first course of DICEP. There was a delay in platelet recovery and an increase in transfusion requirement during subsequent courses in the GM-CSF group. The result cautions the routine use of lineage specific hematopoietic growth factors in supporting repeated cycles of dose-intensive chemotherapy.",0
A single dose of preoperative gabapentin for pain reduction and requirement of morphine after total mastectomy and axillary dissection: randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial.,"BACKGROUND: Gabapentin has been recently found to be useful for reducing acute postoperative pain when administered preoperatively. Although various dose regimens have been tried in different surgical settings, the minimum effective dose is not established. AIMS: We aimed to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of single low dose gabapentin in patients undergoing total mastectomy and axillary dissection. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Prospective randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial in a tertiary care teaching hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty women scheduled for total mastectomy and axillary dissection were randomized to receive either gabapentin 600 mg or placebo orally 1 h preoperatively. The intraoperative and postoperative management was standardized. Postoperative pain was assessed at rest and on movement for 12 h using the numerical rating scale (NRS). Morphine was administered if NRS exceeded 30. Primary outcome measure was total morphine consumption. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The morphine consumption was compared using independent t test while pain and sedation scores were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Forty-six patients completed the trial. The postoperative morphine consumption was significantly less (5.8 +/- 4.2 vs. 11.0 +/- 3.4 mg; P 0.001) and the median [IQR] time to first analgesic was significantly longer (90 [37.5-120] vs. 0 [0-90] min; P 0.001) in the gabapentin group than in the placebo group. The incidence of side effects was similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: A single low dose of 600 mg gabapentin administered 1 h prior to surgery produced effective and significant postoperative analgesia after total mastectomy and axillary dissection without significant side effects.",0
Accurate axillary lymph node dissection is feasible after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.,"BACKGROUND: Recently, lower axillary lymph node retrieval after neoadjuvant chemotherapy was reported. We did not have this experience, and retrospectively analyzed our axillary lymph node dissections (ALNDs). METHODS: One hundred ninety-one patients who had ALND after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were compared with 192 patients with primary ALND after a positive sentinel node biopsy. RESULTS: There were no differences in the mean number of nodes retrieved between the neoadjuvant group and the primary surgery group: 16.3 (range 4-38) and 15.8 (range 6-33), respectively (P = .4); or in the retrieval of fewer than 10 lymph nodes: 13/191 (7%) and 11/192 (6%) (P = .7). The number of cases with retrieval of more than 20 lymph nodes was higher in the neoadjuvant group: 42/191 (22%) versus 26/192 (13%) (P = .03). In the neoadjuvant group, 150/191 (79%) patients had residual lymph node metastasis after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Our results show the feasibility and need to remove enough lymph nodes to provide precise prognostic information and adequate local control.",0
Clodronate treatment influences MMP-2 associated outcome in node positive breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: Serum postoperative matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) level is a predictor of outcome in node positive breast cancer and can be used to stratify patients into low and high risk groups. Our aim was to determine how clodronate treatment influences MMP-2 associated clinical outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women with primary node-positive breast cancer were randomized to control group or to receive oral clodronate for 3 years. Adjuvant chemo- or endocrine therapy was given to all patients. The follow-up time for all patients was 5 years. MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels were quantitatively measured from the serum of 252 patients before and after 1 year clodronate treatment using enzyme-linked immunoassays. RESULTS: In clodronate-treated patients, postoperative MMP-2 levels did not predict 5-year disease-free survival or overall survival (DFS, in low MMP-2 group (<5.32 ng/ml, median) 53% versus in high MMP-2 group (>median) 63%, p=NS; OS, 68% versus 63%, p=NS). When the patients were grouped according to serum MMP-2 levels, survival rates among patients with low MMP-levels were better in control than clodronate treated patients (DFS, 82% versus 53%, p = 0.003; OS, 91% versus 68%, p=0.014). Among patients with high serum MMP-2 levels, no significant difference in DFS or OS was found between control and clodronate groups. In multivariate analysis of low risk patients, independent predictors for DFS were treatment, age, nodal and PgR status, and those for OS treatment together with nodal and ER status. During 12 months follow-up, MMP-2 levels increased significantly more in clodonate receiving patients than in controls (p = 0.002). In comparison, when the patients were grouped according to MMP-9 levels, clodronate also impaired DFS among patients with low MMP-9 levels (82% versus 53%, p = 0.02), but no influence on OS was observed (83% versus 70%, p = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: Clodronate interferes with the prognostic value of serum MMP-2. Clodronate has a negative impact on outcome among patients with low serum MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels, while no such influence is observed among patients with high MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels.",0
Placebo-controlled trial of local anaesthesia for treatment of pain after breast reconstruction.,"Breast reconstruction with submuscular tissue implants is associated with substantial postoperative pain. High pain scores despite large doses of opioids were described in earlier studies, which indicated that opioids alone or together with paracetamol are insufficient. In the present placebo-controlled study we aimed to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of local anaesthesia as a supplement. Forty-three women who had previously been operated on for breast cancer and were listed for unilateral secondary breast reconstruction were assigned at random to one of two groups. The patients received 2.5 mg/ml levobupivacaine (Chirocaine) 15 ml or placebo in a double-blind manner through an indwelling catheter in the operation site every three hours for 45 hours. All patients were given oral paracetamol 1 g x 4 orally and morphine intravenously as patient-controlled analgesia. A visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to assess the intensity of the postoperative pain. Amount of morphine used was recorded. The women in the levobupivacaine group (n=21) reported significantly less pain at rest during the first 15 hours postoperatively (p<0.05). During mobilisation the intensity of pain was lower for the first six hours (p=0.01) and for the interval 18-24 hours (p=0.045) in the same group. Total mean (SD) consumption of opioids in the levobupivacaine and placebo groups was 24.6 mg (22.88) and 33.8 mg (30.82), respectively (p=0.28). After reconstruction, levobupivacaine injected locally every third hour as a supplement to paracetamol orally and morphine given by PCA resulted in improved pain relief at rest and during mobilisation. Morphine consumption was reduced, but this was not significant (p=0.28).",0
Results of the CONFIRM phase III trial comparing fulvestrant 250 mg with fulvestrant 500 mg in postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive advanced breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: We compared fulvestrant 500 mg regimen with the approved dose of fulvestrant 250 mg per month for treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive advanced breast cancer who experienced progression after prior endocrine therapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Comparison of Faslodex in Recurrent or Metastatic Breast Cancer (CONFIRM) is a double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter, phase III study. Patients were randomly assigned to fulvestrant 500 mg (500 mg intramuscularly [IM] on day 0, then 500 mg IM on days 14 and 28 and every 28 days thereafter) or 250 mg every 28 days. Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included objective response rate, clinical benefit rate (CBR), duration of clinical benefit (DoCB), overall survival (OS), and quality of life (QOL).RESULTS: PFS was significantly longer for fulvestrant 500 mg (n = 362) than 250 mg (n = 374) (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.94; P = .006), corresponding to a 20% reduction in risk of progression. Objective response rate was similar for fulvestrant 500 mg and 250 mg (9.1% v 10.2%, respectively). CBR was 45.6% for fulvestrant 500 mg and 39.6% for fulvestrant 250 mg. DoCB and OS were 16.6 and 25.1 months, respectively, for the 500-mg group, whereas DoCB and OS were 13.9 and 22.8 months, respectively, in the 250-mg group. Fulvestrant 500 mg was well tolerated with no dose-dependent adverse events. QOL was similar for both arms.CONCLUSION: Fulvestrant 500 mg was associated with a statistically significant increase in PFS and not associated with increased toxicity, corresponding to a clinically meaningful improvement in benefit versus risk compared with fulvestrant 250 mg.",1
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group randomized trials of observation versus maintenance therapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer in complete remission following induction treatment.,"PURPOSE: To investigate the value of maintenance treatment for patients with metastatic breast cancer whose disease is in complete remission (CR). PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred ninety-five women (141 eligible) whose disease was in CR or in CR except for bone metastases following six cycles (6 months) of doxorubicin-containing induction treatment were randomized to receive cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil, prednisone, tamoxifen, and halotestin [CMF(P)TH] or observation. In a previous pilot study, patients in CR after 24 months of induction treatment were randomized to continue chemotherapy for 4 more years or stop chemotherapy. RESULTS: Among patients randomized to CMF(P)TH, life-threatening toxicity included leukopenia in 3%, thrombocytopenia in 3%, cardiac in 2%, and diabetes in 1%. The median time to relapse from randomization was 18.7 months on CMF(P)TH and only 7.8 months on observation (P < .0001). The median time to death was 32.2 months on CMF(P)TH and 28.7 months on observation (P=.74). Similar results were seen in the pilot study (median time to relapse, 12.6 and 6.4 months; median survival, 37.7 and 24.2 months; study too small for statistical significance). Maintenance treatment was always the most significant covariate in time-to-relapse models. CONCLUSION: There is definite toxicity associated with CMF(P)TH maintenance treatment. When CR was obtained on induction, maintenance treatment with CMF(P)TH was never significant in survival models. However, maintenance treatment was always the most significant covariate in the time-to-relapse models, which motivates its consideration for appropriately informed patients.",1
Analysis of overall survival from a phase III study of ixabepilone plus capecitabine versus capecitabine in patients with MBC resistant to anthracyclines and taxanes.,"Limited proven treatment options exist for patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) resistant to anthracycline and taxane treatment. Ixabepilone, a novel semisynthetic analog of epothilone B, has demonstrated single-agent activity in MBC resistant to anthracyclines and taxanes. In combination with capecitabine in a phase III trial (CA163-046) in this setting, ixabepilone prolonged progression-free survival and increased objective response rate relative to capecitabine (Thomas et al. J Clin Oncol 25:5210-5217, 2007). Here, we report the results of overall survival (OS), a secondary efficacy endpoint from the CA163-046 trial. Seven hundred fifty-two patients with MBC resistant to anthracyclines and taxanes were randomized to ixabepilone (40 mg/m(2) intravenously on day 1 of a 21-day cycle) plus capecitabine (2,000 mg/m(2) orally on days 1 through 14 of a 21-day cycle) or capecitabine alone (2,500 mg/m(2) on the same schedule). Patients receiving ixabepilone plus capecitabine treatment had a median survival of 12.9 months compared to 11.1 months for patients receiving capecitabine alone (HR = 0.9; 95%CI: 077-1.05; P = 0.19). This observed increase in median OS favored the combination; however, the difference was not statistically significant. Predefined subset analyses showed a clinically meaningful increase in OS in KPS 70-80 patients receiving ixabepilone plus capecitabine (HR = 0.75; 95% CI: 0.58-0.98). Ixabepilone plus capecitabine did not show a significant improvement in survival compared to capecitabine alone in patients with MBC resistant to anthracyclines and taxanes. The observed differences in survival favored the combination arm. A clinical benefit was also seen in patients in the KPS 70-80 subgroup.",0
The effect of danazol on discrete benign breast lumps.,"Surgical biopsy of benign breast lumps produces a significant surgical workload, morbidity and cost. A double-blind placebo-controlled trial of danazol 200 mg daily was carried out with the aim of reducing the size of solid discrete breast lumps, thereby avoiding surgical biopsy in benign cases. Twenty-two women with lumps diagnosed as benign by clinical examination, mammography and cytology were randomized to take danazol and 26 placebo. The patients were assessed monthly by two clinicians until surgical biopsy. Twenty patients in each treatment group were evaluated and five patients discontinued treatment (two on danazol, three on placebo) and three (all on placebo) were found to be malignant. There was no difference in the number of lumps which responded to treatment with danazol or placebo. There was a reduction in the number of lumps which subsequently developed in the breasts treated with danazol during the 12-month follow-up period, but this failed to achieve statistical significance. Danazol does not promote resolution of solid discrete benign breast lumps. Careful selection of women over 25 years for surgery with solid discrete breast lumps is required, utilizing a dedicated breast cytologist with a multidisciplinary approach, to avoid missing breast cancers.",0
Population-based pharmacoeconomic model for adopting capecitabine/docetaxel combination treatment for anthracycline-pretreated metastatic breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: To model the cost-effectiveness of adopting capecitabine/docetaxel combination therapy in place of single-agent taxane therapy for women in the province of Ontario, Canada, receiving treatment for anthracycline-pretreated metastatic breast cancer. METHODS: Clinical effectiveness and economic data were combined in a population model, from the perspective of a universal health care system. Estimates of clinical effectiveness and medical resource utilization were derived prospectively during a phase III randomized controlled trial comparing single-agent docetaxel with capecitabine/docetaxel combination therapy. Population data were obtained from the Cancer Care Ontario Registry and provincial prescription claims data. RESULTS: During 1999-2000, 542 patients were eligible for taxane monotherapy. As capecitabine/docetaxel treatment confers a median 3-month survival benefit compared with docetaxel monotherapy, the projected survival gain in these patients was 136 life-years. The results of the cost-effectiveness analysis demonstrate that the survival benefit provided by the addition of capecitabine to single-agent docetaxel is afforded at a small incremental cost of Canadian $3,691 per life-year gained. Hospitalization costs for treatment of adverse events were less for patients receiving capecitabine/docetaxel combination therapy than for those receiving docetaxel monotherapy. The results were robust for adjustments in treatment costs and adverse effects costs. CONCLUSION: Due to its 3-month survival gain and small incremental treatment cost, capecitabine/docetaxel is judged to be a highly cost-effective treatment in anthracycline-pretreated advanced breast cancer. From the perspective of the Ontario health care system, the addition of capecitabine to docetaxel in this patient population is a clinically appropriate and economically acceptable treatment strategy.",0
Evaluation of monoclonal antibody MIB-1 in the mammary epithelium adjacent to fibroadenomas in premenopausal women treated with tamoxifen.,"The purpose of this study was to study the monoclonal antibody MIB-1 in the normal breast epithelium adjacent to a fibroadenoma in women in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle who were treated with tamoxifen at doses of 10 and 20 mg for 22 days. The proliferative activity of the mammary epithelium adjacent to the fibroadenoma was studied by immunohistochemistry on the basis of the monoclonal antibody MIB-1 (Immunotech, catalog No. 0505, lot 001). The study was randomized and double blind and was conducted on 44 women with fibroadenomas divided into three groups: A (n=16, placebo), B (n=15, tamoxifen, 10 mg), and C (n=13, tamoxifen, 20 mg). Tamoxifen was administered for 22 days starting on the 2nd day of the menstrual cycle, and a biopsy was taken on the 23rd day. Serum estradiol, progesterone, sex hormone binding globulin, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and prolactin were measured before treatment (21st and 24th day of the previous menstrual cycle) and on the day of the biopsy. The mean percentage of stained nuclei per 1,000 cells was 9.2 in group A, 4.5 in group B, and 3.2 in group C. The Fisher's test revealed that tamoxifen significantly reduced MIB-1 at doses of 10 and 20 mg compared with the placebo group (p < 0.0001), with no significant differences between doses in terms of proliferative activity (p=0.21). Groups B and C presented a significant increase in progesterone (p=0.038), estradiol (p < 0.001), and sex hormone binding globulin (p=0.001) levels. Elevation of serum follicle-stimulating hormone concentration (p=0.0045) and a fall in prolactin levels (p=0.0055) were observed. We conclude that tamoxifen significantly reduced the proliferative activity of the mammary epithelium at the doses of 10 and 20 mg/day.",0
Radiosensitization with low-dose carboplatin enhances pain palliation in radioisotope therapy with strontium-89.,"Strontium-89 (89Sr) is currently used for the treatment of painful bone metastases. This study reports the use of low-dose carboplatin as a radiosensitizer in 89Sr radioisotope therapy. The study design comprised two groups: 15 patients treated with 89Sr (148 MBq) followed by carboplatin (100 mg m-2 at 7 and 21 days) and 15 patients treated with 89Sr alone. Their pain response was assessed 8 weeks post-injection. Follow-up was continued for up to 1 year in the survivors. Twenty-seven patients were evaluable. A pain response was observed in 20 of 27 (74%) patients. The pain response in the patients treated with 89Sr and carboplatin was clearly superior to that seen in the patients treated with 89Sr alone (P = 0.025), whereas survival was only marginally better in the combined treatment group (8.1 vs 5.7 months, P = 0.19). No clinically significant adverse effects or myelosuppression by carboplatin were observed. Low-dose carboplatin enhances the effects of 89Sr radioisotope therapy on pain from bone metastases.",0
Mobilization of peripheral blood stem cells with chemotherapy and recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF): a randomized evaluation of different doses of rhG-CSF.,"To date, no randomized study has compared different doses of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) following submyeloablative mobilization chemotherapy. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of different doses of rhG-CSF following mobilization chemotherapy on yields of CD34+ peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC). Fifty patients were randomized to receive 8 (n = 25) versus 16 microg/kg/d (n = 25) of rhG-CSF following mobilization chemotherapy. The median number of CD34+ cells collected after 8 microg/kg/d of rhG-CSF was 2.36 x 10(6)/kg (range, 0.21-7.80), compared with 7.99 (2.76-14.89) after 16 microg/kg/d (P < 0.001). Twenty out of 25 (80%) patients in the low-dose and 23 out of 25 (92%) in the high-dose rhG-CSF arm underwent high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Median days to white blood cell engraftment in patients mobilized with 8 microg/kg and 16 microg/kg of rhG-CSF were 12 (10-20) and 9 (8-11) respectively (P < 0.001). There was no difference between the two groups regarding the other parameters of peritransplant morbidity: days to platelet engraftment (P = 0.10), number of red blood cell (P = 0.56) and platelet transfusions (P = 0.22), days of total parenteral nutrition requirement (P = 0.84), fever (P = 0.93) and antibiotics (P = 0.77), and number of different antibiotics used (P = 0.58). These data showed that higher doses of rhG-CSF following submyeloablative mobilization chemotherapy were associated with a clear dose-response effect based on the collected cell yields. Based on the parameters of peritransplant morbidity, 8 microg/kg/d was as effective as 16 microg/kg/d except for a rapid neutrophil engraftment in the high-dose arm. Therefore, in routine clinical practice, despite some advantage in the use of higher doses of rhG-CSF, lower doses may be used for PBSC collections following chemotherapy-based mobilization regimens in this cost-conscious era.",0
Adjuvant tamoxifen in early breast cancer: occurrence of new primary cancers.,"The frequency of new primary cancers was studied in 1846 postmenopausal patients included in a randomised trial of tamoxifen as an adjunct to primary surgery for early breast cancer. The median follow-up was 4.5 years (range 0.5-10.5 years). The number of new cancers in the tamoxifen group (n = 57) did not differ significantly from that in the control group (n = 70). However, in tamoxifen patients second breast cancers occurred less often and endometrial cancer occurred more often than in the controls. The increase in endometrial cancers was probably related to the agonistic oestrogenic effects of tamoxifen and was most pronounced in those treated for over 2 years.",0
Different methods for the detection of small changes in uptake between single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) examinations: 99mTc-sestamibi in chemotherapy for breast tumours.,"AIM: This study was undertaken to evaluate different methods for the detection of small changes in uptake between single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) examinations in the same individual. No standard exists for making digital evaluations at single-photon examinations. For this purpose, we employed a patient cohort from a previous study assessing the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer using Tc-hexakis-2-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (Tc-sestamibi). METHODS: The tumour uptake in 29 women with locally advanced breast cancer was examined using Tc-sestamibi and SPECT before neoadjuvant chemotherapy and, on average, 19 days after one chemotherapy cycle. The histology of the finally resected tumour confirmed a therapeutic response. Different assessments of the uptake, various levels of background activity subtraction and different reference tissues for relative activity calculations were used. The tumour uptake and activity of the reference tissues were also related to the administered activity. RESULTS: Different definitions of tumour activity had little influence. Relating the tumour uptake to a large portion of the abdomen, as well as visual evaluation, showed a therapeutic response. Comparison with the administered activity showed that the apparent responses were due to an increased activity of the reference tissues. Referring the tumour uptake to the administered activity truly depicted a therapeutic response. CONCLUSIONS: A critical attitude is necessary when making digital evaluations at SPECT. Digital data may seem more relevant than they really are. Relative comparisons may be unreliable. It may be necessary to develop standardized methods for this purpose.",0
Evaluation of the addition of video-based education for patients receiving standard pre-chemotherapy education.,"Preparing cancer patients and their families for chemotherapy treatment is difficult. The challenge lies in finding ways to promote self-care and improve their ability to recall instructions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of an educational video with regard to patients' ability to recall and report side effects of treatment. Patients referred for adjuvant chemotherapy for breast and colorectal cancer were randomized to receive standard pre-chemotherapy education or standard education plus addition of a video. Patients completed a base line questionnaire assessing existing knowledge and another questionnaire prior to the second chemotherapy cycle evaluating recall of information. Patients who watched the video were asked to assess the video after six cycles of chemotherapy. Telephone calls to the department reporting symptoms were monitored for both groups. The video group demonstrated trends towards higher recall in information concerning fever, mouth problems, low red cell count and prevention of constipation. They more commonly telephoned reporting medical problems of nausea, vomiting and signs of infection compared with the standard group. In summary, our study demonstrated inclusion of video to standard chemotherapy education improves retention of information regarding management of predictable chemotherapy side effects and reporting of treatment-related symptoms.",0
The effects of pegylated recombinant human megakaryocyte growth and development factor (PEG-rHuMGDF) on platelet recovery in breast cancer patients undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and efficacy of pegylated recombinant human megakaryocyte growth and development factor (PEG-rHuMGDF) administered after autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were done. In the phase 1/2 study, 75 breast cancer patients underwent a bone marrow harvest and myeloablative STAMP V chemotherapy and were randomized to receive placebo or one of three doses of PEG-rHuMGDF. In the phase 3 study, 64 patients were randomized to receive placebo or the minimally effective dose of PEG-rHuMGDF. The study drug was administered daily starting on the day of bone marrow infusion until the platelet count was greater than or equal to 50 x 10(9)/L (without transfusion) or for a maximum of 28 days. All patients received 10 microg/kg/day filgrastim starting on day 2 until neutrophil count recovery. RESULTS: PEG-rHuMGDF appeared to be safe and well tolerated. No significant differences were noted in mortality or disease progression rates. Antibodies to MGDF were not observed. In the phase 1/2 study, the time to platelet recovery to greater than or equal to 20 x 10(9)/L and platelet transfusion requirements were significantly reduced for patients treated with PEG-rHuMGDF compared with placebo (p < 0.05). In the phase 3 study, no significant differences in the kinetics of early thrombopoiesis or platelet transfusions after ABMT were observed. CONCLUSIONS: PEG-rHuMGDF was not consistently efficacious in reducing the duration of severe thrombocytopenia. The maximum platelet counts for PEG-rHuMGDF-treated patients occurred a median of 2 weeks after the last dose of drug, suggesting that the biologic effects of this hematopoietic cytokine are delayed compared with other hematopoietic cytokines.",0
Mitomycin C and vinblastine in combination with amifostine in metastatic breast cancer. A feasibility study of the EORTC--Investigational Drug Branch for Breast Cancer (IDBBC).,"Mitomycin C (MMC)-vinblastine (VBL) is a regimen that has commonly been used as salvage therapy for advanced breast cancer for many years. The hematologic toxicity of this combination is one aspect that limits its usefulness. Amifostine, an organic thiophosphate, has been developed as a selective chemoprotective agent. In this pilot study, we tested the feasibility of MMC/VBL administration in combination with amifostine and we monitored the hematologic toxicity closely. Patients having failed one or two chemotherapy regimens for advanced breast cancer, with a good performance status scored at 2 or better and measurable or evaluable lesion(s), were eligible. They were treated according to the following schedule: mitomycin C 10 mg/m2 i.v. day 1, vinblastine 5 mg/m2 i.v. day 1 and 15, amifostine 910 mg/m2 in short i.v. infusion prior to MMC. Premedication consisted of dexamethasone 3 x 20 mg, haloperidol 2 x 0.5 mg p.o., hydration with 11 of normal saline, metoclopramide 1.5 mg/kg in short infusion and procyclide HCl 10 mg i.v. Cycles were repeated every 4 weeks. In all, 14 cycles were administrated to six heavily pretreated patients. Following the first cycle, five of the six patients experienced grade 3 or 4 neutropenia on day 15, and consequently did not receive the second vinblastine administration as planned. Three out of four patients receiving two or more cycles had moderate thrombocytopenia. There were no patients with neutropenic fever or major bleeding problems. The MMC/VBL+amifostine regimen was well tolerated regarding other toxicities. Neither amifostine-related acute vomiting nor any significant decrease in blood pressure was observed. Administration of amifostine in combination with MMC/VBL was feasible but in this group of heavily pretreated patients there were no hints of a protective effect of amifostine on the hematologic toxicity profile of this chemotherapy regimen.",1
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists for prevention of chemotherapy-induced ovarian damage: prospective randomized study.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether GnRHa administration before and during combination chemotherapy for breast cancer could preserve posttreatment ovarian function in young women or not.DESIGN: Prospective randomized controlled study.SETTING: Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Mansura University Hospital, Mansura, Egypt.PATIENT(S): Eighty patients with unilateral adenocarcinoma of the breast and with no metastasis who had undergone modified radical mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery plus full axillary lymph node dissection were included in the study. Patients were assigned randomly to receive combined GnRHa and chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone. One woman in each group dropped out.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Return of spontaneous menstruation and ovulation. Hormonal changes (FSH, LH, E(2), P) during and after the course of treatment.RESULT(S): In the study group, 89.6% resumed menses and 69.2% resumed spontaneous ovulation within 3-8 months of termination of the GnRHa/chemotherapy cotreatment; 11.4% experienced hypergonadotrophic amenorrhoea and ovarian failure 8 months after treatment. In the control group (chemotherapy without GnRHa), 33.3% resumed menses and 25.6% resumed normal ovarian activity. The median FSH and LH concentrations, 6 months after completion of the GnRHa/chemotherapy cotreatment group, were significantly less than the control group. During the GnRHa/chemotherapy cotreatment the concentrations of FSH, LH, and P decreased to almost prepubertal levels. However, within 1-3 months after the last GnRHa injection, an increase in LH and FSH concentrations was detected, followed several weeks later in by an increase in P concentrations to within normal levels.CONCLUSION(S): GnRHa administration before and during combination chemotherapy for breast cancer may preserve posttreatment ovarian function in women <40 years. Long-term studies are required.",0
"Comparison of anastrozole versus tamoxifen as preoperative therapy in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer: the Pre-Operative ""Arimidex"" Compared to Tamoxifen (PROACT) trial.","BACKGROUND: The Pre-Operative ""Arimidex"" Compared to Tamoxifen (PROACT) study was a randomized, multicenter study comparing anastrozole with tamoxifen as a preoperative treatment of postmenopausal women with large, operable (T2/3, N0-2, M0), or potentially operable (T4b, N0-2, M0) breast cancer. The effect of preoperative endocrine therapy in patients scheduled for mastectomy or with inoperable tumors at baseline was also investigated. METHODS: Patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer received anastrozole (n = 228) or tamoxifen (n = 223) with or without chemotherapy for 12 weeks before primary surgery. RESULTS: Objective responses for anastrozole and tamoxifen occurred in 39.5% and 35.4% of patients, respectively (ultrasound measurements), and 50.0% and 46.2% of patients, respectively (caliper measurements). In hormonal therapy-only patients (n = 314), feasible surgery at baseline improved after 3 months in 43.0% of patients receiving anastrozole and 30.8% receiving tamoxifen (P = .04). In the intent-to-treat population, improvement in feasible surgery at baseline to actual surgery at 3 months was found to be numerically higher in the anastrozole group compared with the tamoxifen group, although this difference did not reach significance. Drug-related adverse events were reported in 20.2% and 18.1% of patients, respectively, in the anastrozole and tamoxifen groups. CONCLUSIONS: Anastrozole is an effective and well-tolerated preoperative therapy, producing clinically beneficial tumor downstaging and reductions in tumor volume. These effects enable more minimal surgical interventions in patients scheduled for mastectomy, and mastectomy in patients with previously inoperable tumors. Anastrozole appears to be at least as effective as tamoxifen in this setting, and more effective than tamoxifen in certain clinically relevant subgroups. Cancer 2006.

Comparison of the efficacy of different doses of Ukrain in the combined treatment of breast cancer.,"The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of different Ukrain doses in the combined treatment of 75 patients with breast cancer. The patients were divided into three groups: groups I and II (25 patients each) were treated with 50 mg and 100 mg of Ukrain, respectively, before surgery; group III (25 patients) served as control (without Ukrain treatment). Clinical observations, biochemical, hormonal and immunologic indices indicated that both doses of Ukrain had a similar beneficial effect on patient outcome and may be indicated in the presurgical treatment of patients with breast cancer.",1
The Scottish trial of adjuvant tamoxifen in node-negative breast cancer. Scottish Cancer Trials Breast Group.,"This paper presents results, 5 years after closure, of a randomized trial comparing adjuvant with postrelapse tamoxifen in 747 women with histological node-negative breast cancer. Two hundred thirty-six disease-free patients on adjuvant therapy were secondarily randomly assigned at 5 years to stop or to continue tamoxifen until relapse. Adjuvant tamoxifen, taken for a median duration of 60 months, has significantly prolonged disease-free survival overall (P = .0001), in the 214 premenopausal group (P = .018), in the 533 postmenopausal group (P = .0026), and for the 246 patients with estrogen receptor levels greater than 19 fmol/mg of protein (P = .0032); distant relapse has also been delayed overall (P = .029). Total survival comparison by Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis shows a nonsignificant trend in the same direction (P = .07). Adjuvant tamoxifen has also reduced the incidence of contralateral breast cancer and of death from myocardial infarction. No increase in the incidence of endometrial cancer has been found.",0
Long-term results of a randomized trial on the sequencing of radiotherapy and chemotherapy in breast cancer.,"OBJECTIVE: A prospective, phase III randomized study was undertaken to compare the outcomes of 2 different radiotherapy and chemotherapy sequences in conservatively treated patients with breast cancer.METHODS: Between January 1997 and November 2002, 206 patients operated of quadrantectomy and axillary dissection for breast cancer, candidates to receive adjuvant CMF chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil) were assigned to concurrent or sequential radiation treatment by using a balanced randomization method. Before randomization patients were stratified by tumor diameter, age, and lymph node status. The primary end point was the freedom from breast recurrence, and secondary end points were overall and disease-free survival. Overall outcomes were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle.RESULTS: All 206 patients enrolled and randomized in the trial were analyzed. The median follow-up was 111 months, with no patient lost for follow-up. No difference in 10-years breast recurrence-free, disease-free, metastasis-free, and overall survival rates was observed in the 2 treatment sequence groups. The Hazard Ratios, calculated for each prognostic factor, showed no difference in all outcomes between the 2 treatment sequences.CONCLUSIONS: No influence of the treatment sequence on long-term outcomes was observed in this trial. This finding suggests that to avoid an increased risk of distant recurrence or an excessive toxicity, radiation therapy may be delayed until after the end of the more, recently used, anthracycline-based chemotherapy without increasing the risk of breast recurrences, thus allowing the delivery of full-dose chemotherapy in patients at risk for systemic disease spread.",0
Population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral etoposide.,"AIMS: To study the population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral etoposide in patients with solid tumours. METHODS: A prospective, open label, cross-over, bioavailability study was performed in 50 adult patients with miscellaneous, advanced stage solid tumours, who were receiving oral (100 mg capsules) etoposide for 14 days and i.v. (50 mg) etoposide on day 1 or day 7 in randomised order during the first cycle treatment. Total and unbound etoposide concentration were assayed by h.p.l.c. Population PK parameters estimation was done by using the P-Pharm software (Simed). Haematological toxicity and tumour response were the main pharmacodynamic endpoints. RESULTS: Mean clearance was 1.14 l h(-1) (CV 25%). Creatinine clearance was the only covariable to significantly reduce clearance variability (residual CV 18%). (CL = 0.74 + 0.0057 CLCR; r(2) = 0.32). Mean bioavailability was 45% (CV 22%) and mean protein binding 91.5% (CV 5%). Exposure to free, pharmacologically active etoposide (free AUC p.o.) was highly variable (mean value 2.8 mg l(-1) h; CV 64%; range 0.4-9.5). It decreased with increased creatinine clearance and increased with age which accounted for 9% of the CV. Mean free AUC p.o. was the best predictor of neutropenia. Free AUC50 (exposure producing a 50% reduction in absolute neutrophil count) was 1.80 mg l(-1) h. In patients with lung cancer, the free AUC p.o. was higher in the two patients with responsive tumour (5.9 mg l(-1) h) than in patients with stable (2.1 mg l-1 h) or progressive disease (2.3 mg l-1 h) (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to free etoposide during prolonged oral treatment is highly variable and is the main determinant of pharmacodynamic effects. The population PK model based on creatinine clearance is poorly predictive of exposure. Therapeutic drug monitoring would be necessary for dose individualization or to study the relationship between exposure and antitumour effect.",1
99mTc depreotide scan compared with 99mTc-MDP bone scintigraphy for the detection of bone metastases and prediction of response to hormonal treatment in patients with breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine the potential role of Tc depreotide scintigraphy for the evaluation of bone metastases compared with Tc methylenediphosphonate (MDP) bone scintigraphy and for the prediction of treatment response in breast cancer patients in whom first- or second-line hormonal therapy was to be initiated. METHODS: Twelve patients with a diagnosis of advanced breast cancer were included. All patients underwent both a bone scan and a depreotide scan and at least one other conventional imaging procedure, including plain film radiography (n=11), computed tomography (n=6) or magnetic resonance imaging (n=5), for confirmation of metastatic disease. The mean time interval between the bone scan and the depreotide scan was 30.6 days. Follow-up data were retrieved from routine clinical evaluation by means of physical examination, imaging and blood analysis. RESULTS: On a patient basis we found a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of, respectively 100%, 50% and 83.3% for the bone scan and 62.5%, 100% and 75% for the depreotide scan in the diagnosis of bone metastasis. In eight patients with available follow-up data two with a positive depreotide scan remained stable and five of six patients with a negative depreotide scan had progressive disease. CONCLUSION: In this small series of breast cancer patients Tc depreotide scintigraphy proves less sensitive but more specific as compared to Tc-MDP bone scintigraphy in measuring the extent of bone metastasis. On the other hand Tc depreotide scintigraphy elucidates, non-invasively, tumour characteristics and may be indicative for prognosis and response to hormonal treatment.",0
Detection and HER2 expression of circulating tumor cells: prospective monitoring in breast cancer patients treated in the neoadjuvant GeparQuattro trial.,"PURPOSE: This study was aimed at detecting and characterizing circulating tumor cells (CTC) before and after neoadjuvant therapy (NT) in the peripheral blood of patients with breast cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The clinical trial GeparQuattro incorporated NT approaches (epirubicin/cyclophosphamide prior to randomization to docetaxel alone, docetaxel in combination with capecitabine, or docetaxel followed by capecitabine) and additional trastuzumab treatment for patients with HER2-positive tumors. We used the Food and Drug Administration-approved CellSearch system for CTC detection and evaluation of HER2 expression and developed HER2 immunoscoring for CTC. RESULTS: We detected > or =1 CTC/7.5 mL in 46 of 213 patients (21.6%) before NT and in 22 of 207 patients (10.6%) after NT (P = 0.002). Twenty (15.0%) initially CTC-positive cases were CTC-negative after NT, whereas 11 (8.3%) cases were CTC-positive after NT, although no CTC could be found before NT. CTC detection did not correlate with primary tumor characteristics. Furthermore, there was no association between tumor response to NT and CTC detection. HER2-overexpressing CTC were observed in 14 of 58 CTC-positive patients (24.1%), including 8 patients with HER2-negative primary tumors and 3 patients after trastuzumab treatment. CTC scored HER2-negative or weakly HER2-positive before or after NT were present in 11 of 21 patients with HER2-positive primary tumors. HER2 overexpression on CTC was restricted to ductal carcinomas and associated with high tumor stage (P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: CTC number was low in patients with primary breast cancer. The decrease in CTC incidence during treatment was not correlated with standard clinical characteristics and primary tumor response. Information on the HER2 status of CTC might be helpful for stratification and monitoring of HER2-directed therapies.",0
The importance of the histologic grade of invasive breast carcinoma and response to chemotherapy.,"BACKGROUND: Histologic grade is well recognized for its prognostic significance in cases of primary operable invasive breast carcinoma; however, the majority of studies in which grade has been assessed have been based on single-center trials. In addition, the role of grade in predicting response to chemotherapy has not been examined in many previous studies. METHODS: The authors assessed the value of Nottingham histologic grade (NHG) in a group of 465 patients enrolled in a multicenter, randomized International Breast Cancer Study Group clinical trial of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with lymph node (LN) positive and LN negative primary breast carcinoma (formerly named Ludwig Trial V). RESULTS: NHG was a predictor of overall survival for both LN negative and LN positive patients (P=0.045 and P < 0.001, respectively). NHG was associated with a poorer prognosis for both LN positive and LN negative patients, with hazard ratios of 1.651 (P < 0.001) and 1.437 (P=0.045), respectively, for an increase of one grade. Among LN negative patients, this survival disadvantage was observed only for those who received perioperative chemotherapy. For LN positive patients, an increase of one grade resulted in a significant overall survival disadvantage regardless of whether prolonged or perioperative chemotherapy was given. For LN negative patients grouped by grade, there was no observed difference in overall or disease free survival according to whether perioperative chemotherapy or no adjuvant therapy was given. However, LN positive patients with Grade 3 tumors had a significantly greater overall and disease free survival benefit from prolonged chemotherapy than from perioperative chemotherapy (P=0.016 and P=0.013, respectively); LN positive patients with Grade 1 or 2 disease in both treatment arms had comparable overall and disease free survival. A strong correlation between the previously utilized Bloom-Richardson grading system (BRG) and NHG was observed (P < 0.001 and kappa=82%) and no apparent differences in overall and disease free survival were observed between the two systems. NHG did, however, identify a greater proportion of tumors as Grade 1, and BRG identified a greater proportion of breast carcinomas as Grade 3. CONCLUSIONS: This multicenter clinical study confirms the value of histologic grade, and the authors propose that this technique be used to identify Grade 3, LN positive patients who will benefit from prolonged rather than perioperative chemotherapy.",0
Analgetic activity of calcitonin in patients with painful osteolytic metastases of breast cancer. Results of a controlled randomized study.,"The analgesic effect of salmon calcitonin was tested by a double-blind clinical randomized controlled trial in 40 female patients with painful osteolytic metastases. Twenty patients were administered (daily) 100 IU of salmon calcitonin subcutaneously over 28 days, while the other 20 were administered identical ampoules containing 2 ml of physiological solution over the same period of time. The basic treatment (chemotherapy, hormone therapy) was not changed during the trial, and had to be stabilized for a minimum of 3 months prior to the trial. The effect of calcitonin was monitored with respect to daily analgesic consumption, duration of pain, patient's functional capacity, patient's own assessment of pain, and assessment of efficacy by the investigator. Statistically significant differences were established in terms of reduced analgesic consumption, shorter duration of pain and the patient's subjective assessment of pain duration and intensity; the difference was not statistically significant with regard to patient's functional capacity. The objective assessment of the analgesic effect of calcitonin by the investigator showed the drug to be extremely useful in 3 patients and moderately useful in 11 patients; 3 instances of 'moderately useful' were observed in the placebo group. No changes were observed in serum calcium levels; there were likewise no skeleton changes as established by X-rays and bone scintiscans before and at the end of treatment. The trial has shown calcitonin to produce a pronounced analgesic effect in breast cancer patients with painful osteolytic metastases.",0
Quality of life of older patients with early-stage breast cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapy: a companion study to cancer and leukemia group B 49907.,"PURPOSE: A phase III trial (Cancer and Leukemia Group B CALGB-49907) was conducted to test whether older patients with early-stage breast cancer would have equivalent relapse-free and overall survival with capecitabine compared with standard chemotherapy. The quality of life (QoL) substudy tested whether capecitabine treatment would be associated with a better QoL than standard chemotherapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS: QoL was assessed in 350 patients randomly assigned to either standard chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil [CMF] or doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide [AC]; n = 182) or capecitabine (n = 168). Patients were interviewed by telephone before treatment (baseline), midtreatment, within 1 month post-treatment, and at 12, 18, and 24 months postbaseline by using questionnaires from the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), a breast systemic adverse effects scale (EORTC BR23), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).RESULTS: Compared with patients who were treated with standard chemotherapy, patients who were treated with capecitabine had significantly better QoL, role function, and social function, fewer systemic adverse effects, less psychological distress, and less fatigue during and at the completion of treatment (P ≤ .005). Capecitabine treatment was associated with less nausea, vomiting, and constipation and with better appetite than standard treatment (P ≤ .004), but worse hand-foot syndrome and diarrhea (P < .005). These differences all resolved by 12 months.CONCLUSION: Standard chemotherapy was superior to capecitabine in improving relapse-free and overall survival for older women with early-stage breast cancer. Although capecitabine was associated with better QoL during treatment, QoL was similar for both groups at 1 year. The brief period of poorer QoL with standard treatment is a modest price to pay for a chance at improved survival.",1
"Adriamycin, cyclophosphamide and vindesine (ACV) versus mitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide and vindesine (NCV) in advanced breast cancer.","The choice of chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer patients is based on both response rates and anticipated side effects. Two polychemotherapy regimens, ACV and NCV, were compared in an open study with 90 patients of whom 69 were evaluable both for efficacy and toxicity. Both ACV and NCV are active in metastatic breast cancer. ACV leads to more remissions in a relatively short time. NCV treatment results in a larger proportion of stable diseases. ACV causes more important alopecia, nausea and vomiting. NCV gives more anemia. The characteristics of both treatment results give the oncologist the opportunity to choose in particular clinical situations.",1
"Zoledronic acid significantly reduces skeletal complications compared with placebo in Japanese women with bone metastases from breast cancer: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.","PURPOSE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid for the treatment of bone metastases from breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women with bone metastases (N = 228) were randomly assigned to receive 4 mg zoledronic acid (n = 114) or placebo (n = 114) via 15-minute infusions every 4 weeks for 1 year. The primary efficacy end point was the skeletal-related event (SRE) rate ratio between treatment groups. An SRE was defined as pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, and radiation or surgery to bone. Secondary end points included percentage of patients with at least one SRE, time-to-first SRE, and Andersen-Gill multiple-event analysis. RESULTS: The SRE rate ratio at 1 year (excluding HCM and adjusted for prior fracture) was 0.61 (permutation test; P = .027), indicating that zoledronic acid reduced the rate of SRE by 39% compared with placebo. The percentage of patients with at least one SRE (excluding HCM) was significantly reduced by 20% by zoledronic acid (29.8% v 49.6% for placebo; P = .003). Zoledronic acid significantly delayed time-to-first SRE (median not reached v 364 days; Cox regression; P = .007) and reduced the risk of SREs by 41% in multiple event analysis (risk ratio = 0.59; P = .019) compared with placebo. Zoledronic acid was well tolerated with a safety profile similar to placebo. No patient treated with zoledronic acid had grade 3 or 4 serum creatinine increase. CONCLUSION: Zoledronic acid significantly reduced skeletal complications compared with placebo across multiple end points in Japanese women with bone metastases from breast cancer.",0
Very high quantitative tumor HER2 content and outcome in early breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: It is unknown how a very high tumor total HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor-2) content (H2T) influences outcome in early breast cancer treated with adjuvant trastuzumab plus chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: H2T was measured using a novel quantitative assay (HERmark(®)) from formalin-fixed tumor tissue of 899 women who participated in the FinHer trial (ISRCTN76560285). In a chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) test, 197 (21.9%) patients had HER2-positive cancer and were randomly assigned to receive trastuzumab or control. RESULTS: Cancer H2T levels varied 1808-fold. High H2T levels were correlated with a positive HER2 status by CISH (P < 0.0001). A nonlinear association was present between H2T and the hazard of distant recurrence in a subpopulation treatment effect pattern plot analysis in CISH-positive disease. Patients with very high H2T (defined by ≥22-fold the median of HER2-negative cancers; 13% of CISH-positive cancers) did not benefit from adjuvant trastuzumab [hazard ratio (HR) 1.23; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33-4.62; P = 0.75], whereas the rest of the patients with HER2-positive disease by CISH (87%) did benefit (HR 0.52; 95% CI 0.28-1.00; P = 0.050). CONCLUSION: Patients with HER2-positive breast cancer with very high tumor HER2 content may benefit less from adjuvant trastuzumab compared with those whose cancer has more moderate HER2 content.",0
Adjuvant therapy for node-negative breast cancer: a cautious interpretation.,,0
Oestrogen receptor analysis of paraffin sections and cytosol samples of primary breast cancer in relation to outcome after adjuvant tamoxifen treatment. The South Sweden Breast Cancer Group.,"The aim of the present study was to compare oestrogen receptor (ER) analysis results obtained in cytosols of frozen breast cancer tissue (using biochemical assay) with those obtained in paraffin-embedded tissue (using immunoperoxidase staining with monoclonal antibodies (DAKO-ER, 1D5), and an ER positivity cut-off level of >10% stained nuclei). In 86% (84/98) of the samples the same ER status (28 negative and 56 positive) was obtained with both procedures. In eight cases, the paraffin section was ER positive but the corresponding cytosol sample ER negative, whereas six cases showed the opposite pattern. The ER positive subgroup manifested better outcome after adjuvant treatment than the ER negative subgroup (p = 0.003 (cytosol), and p = 0.004 (paraffin)). As compared with the percentage of stained nuclei, staining intensity yielded no additional information. Although the results of ER analysis of paraffin-embedded material seem promising, it is too early to prefer it to frozen tissue, though this would be useful when no frozen tissue is available.",0
Radiotherapy and adjuvant trastuzumab in operable breast cancer: tolerability and adverse event data from the NCCTG Phase III Trial N9831.,"PURPOSE: To assess whether trastuzumab (H) with radiotherapy (RT) increases adverse events (AEs) after breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with early-stage resected human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) -positive breast cancer (BC) were randomly assigned to doxorubicin (A) and cyclophosphamide (C), followed by weekly paclitaxel (T; AC-T-H or AC-TH-H). RT criteria (with or without nodal RT) were postlumpectomy breast or (optional) postmastectomy chest wall. RT of internal mammary nodes was prohibited. RT commenced within 5 weeks after T, concurrently with H. Analysis included 1,503 irradiated patients for RT-associated AEs across treatment arms. Rates of cardiac events (CEs) with and without RT were compared within arms. RESULTS: No significant differences among arms were found in incidence of acute skin reaction, pneumonitis, dyspnea, cough, dysphagia, or neutropenia. A significant difference occurred in incidence of leukopenia, with higher rates for AC-T-H versus AC-T (odds ratio = 1.89; 95% CI, 1.25 to 2.88). At a median follow-up of 3.7 years (range, 0 to 6.5 years), RT with H did not increase relative frequency of CEs regardless of treatment side. The cumulative incidence of CEs with AC-T-H was 2.7% with or without RT. With AC-TH-H, the cumulative incidence was 1.7% v 5.9% with or without RT, respectively. CONCLUSION: Concurrent adjuvant RT and H for early-stage BC was not associated with increased acute AEs. Further follow-up is required to assess late AEs.",0
"A randomized, prospective study of endometrial resection to prevent recurrent endometrial polyps in women with breast cancer receiving tamoxifen.","STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess the role of endometrial resection in preventing recurrence of tamoxifen-associated endometrial polyps in women with breast cancer. DESIGN: Randomized, prospective study (Canadian Task Force classification I). SETTING: Tertiary university-affiliated medical center. PATIENTS: Twenty consecutive women (age range 43-61 yrs). INTERVENTIONS: Hysteroscopic removal of tamoxifen-associated endometrial polyps with or without simultaneous resection of the endometrium. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients were randomized to undergo (10 women) or not undergo (10) concomitant endometrial resection. They were followed for at least 18 months (range 18-24 mo), including transvaginal ultrasonography every 6 months and hysteroscopy when endometrial irregularity was noted. The main outcome variable was recurrence of endometrial polyps; occurrence of uterine bleeding was also noted. In women who underwent endometrial resection, only one had a 1 x 1-cm endometrial polyp diagnosed and removed during follow-up. Seven women remained amenorrheic, and three experienced spotting for a few days every month. In the control group, six women had recurrent endometrial polyps requiring hysteroscopic removal (two-tail Fisher's exact test p <0.06). CONCLUSION: Recurrence of endometrial polyps, one of the most common problems in patients with breast cancer receiving long-term treatment with tamoxifen, may be reduced by performing endometrial resection at the time of hysteroscopic removal of polyps. The possible risk of occult endometrial cancer is yet to be determined. (J Am Assoc Gynecol Laparosc 6(3):285-288, 1999)",0
Maturation of vaginal and endometrial epithelium in postmenopausal breast cancer patients receiving long-term tamoxifen.,"To assess the estrogenic effects of tamoxifen on vaginal and endometrial epithelium and to investigate whether these changes are associated with any pathological findings in the endometrium, 53 postmenopausal breast cancer patients receiving long-term tamoxifen and 52 control breast cancer patients without any hormonal treatment were examined. Pathological findings in the endometrium were evaluated by hysteroscopy and curettage. The main outcome measures were the maturation index in Papanicolaou (Pap) smears, estrogen-like epithelial changes in the endometrium, serum concentrations of gonadotropins, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), estradiol (E2), and testosterone (T). Informative Pap smears showed estrogenic effects in 89% (41/46) of the tamoxifen group and in 49% (22/45) of the control group, and in endometrial aspiration samples in 71% (32/45) and in 41% (19/46), respectively. These changes were associated with increased concentrations of serum E2 in the control group but not in the tamoxifen group. All five patients (11%) with endometrial polyps in the control group showed estrogenic endometrial changes, whereas among 14 women with polyps in the tamoxifen group, 9 showed estrogenic changes and 5 endometrial atrophy. Endometrial adenocarcinoma was found in 3 patients in the tamoxifen group and in 2 in the control group. Pap smears showed atrophy in 2 patients in the former and in one in the latter group. These findings confirmed estrogen-like effects of tamoxifen on the vaginal and endometrial epithelium in postmenopausal breast cancer patients, but these were not closely associated with benign or malignant endometrial lesions.",0
Celecoxib anti-aromatase neoadjuvant (CAAN) trial for locally advanced breast cancer.,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of combing aromatase inhibitor (AI) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor neoadjuvantly in postmenopausal patients with invasive hormone-sensitive breast cancer. METHODS: Eighty-two patients were randomly assigned to receive exemestane 25mg daily and celecoxib 400mg twice daily (group A, n=30), exemestane 25mg daily (group B, n=24) and letrozole 2.5mg daily (group C, n=28). RESULTS: All groups showed clinical responses (58.6% for group A, 54.5% for group B and 62.0% for group C) and decrease in tumor area (61.8% for group A, 58.1% for group B and 55.7% for group C). 3 out of 5 patients with complete clinical response were observed from group A and 2 out of 69 patients operated with pathologic complete response were observed in group C. The mean microscopic tumor size was 2.53 cm for group A, 3.05 cm for group B and 2.10 cm for group C. The differences were only statistically significant when group C was compared with group B (P=0.025). The toxicity profiles among groups were satisfactory. CONCLUSION: AI is effective in treating breast cancer and may be safely used preoperatively. The addition of COX-2 inhibitor may provide additional benefit.",1
Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 predicts benefit of paclitaxel chemotherapy in node-positive breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: We tested the hypothesis that Akt-Ser473 phosphorylation (pAkt) predicts benefit from the sequential addition of paclitaxel to adjuvant doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide (AC) chemotherapy in patients with node-positive breast cancer participating in the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-28 trial.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Primary tumors from the NSABP B-28 trial tissue microarray were available from 1,581 of 3,060 patients who were randomly assigned to receive either four cycles of AC alone or followed by four cycles of paclitaxel. Immunohistochemistry and quantitative analysis of pAkt were performed at the National Cancer Institute blinded to clinical outcome. Association between pAkt and clinical outcome was assessed using multivariate Cox modeling adjusting for age, tumor size, number of positive nodes, tumor grade, estrogen receptor status, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status.RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 9.1 years, there were no differences in disease-free survival (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.02; P = .81) or overall survival (HR, 0.97; P = .80) with and without receiving paclitaxel among 975 patients with pAkt-negative tumors. In 606 patients with pAkt-positive tumors, the sequential addition of paclitaxel resulted in a 26% improvement in disease-free survival (HR, 0.74; P = .02) or a 20% improvement in overall survival (HR, 0.80; P = .17).CONCLUSION: pAkt significantly predicts disease-free benefit from the sequential addition of paclitaxel to AC chemotherapy in patients with node-positive breast cancer. Patients with pAkt-negative breast tumors do not appear to benefit from the addition of paclitaxel.",0
Exemestane after tamoxifen as adjuvant hormonal therapy in postmenopausal women with breast cancer: effects on body composition and lipids.,"Recent studies have shown that administering the aromatase inhibitor exemestane after 2-3 years of tamoxifen therapy significantly improves disease-free survival in postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer in comparison with standard 5-year tamoxifen treatment. Although many of the adverse effects associated with exemestane and tamoxifen have been analysed, there are no comparative data concerning body weight and body composition. The aim of this randomised study was to evaluate the longitudinal changes in body composition and lipid profiles in postmenopausal women switched from tamoxifen to exemestane. In total, 60 overweight or obese postmenopausal patients were enrolled. Their anthropometric data, body composition, including fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM), and lipid profiles, caloric intake and physical activity were assessed 1 week before randomisation, and 6 and 12 months later. In all, 55 patients (27 on tamoxifen and 28 on exemestane) completed the 1-year study period. Fat mass had significantly decreased by month 12 in the exemestane, but not in the tamoxifen group; the between-group difference was statistically significant (P<0.01). The FFM/FM ratio had significantly increased in the exemestane group, but not the tamoxifen group; the between-group difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). Triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly decreased (P<0.01; P<0.05), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly increased (P<0.01) in the exemestane group at the end of the 1-year study period. Our findings suggest that switching patients to adjuvant exemestane treatment after at least 2 years of tamoxifen therapy may be associated with an advantage over continuing adjuvant tamoxifen treatment in terms of body composition.",0
A randomized trial of four cycles of adjuvant AC (adriamycin + cyclophosphamide) +/- two cycles of EP (etoposide + cisplatin) in node positive patients with breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Four cycles of AC have been accepted as the standard chemotherapy in breast cancer. In the present randomized study we aimed to assess the efficacy of adjuvant etoposide + cisplatin (EP) combination following four cycles of standard adriamycin + cyclophosphamide (AC) in premenopausal patients with operable breast cancer and axillary lymph node metastasis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Premenopausal patients with positive axillary lymph nodes following curative modified radical mastectomy were randomized to either four cycles of AC (82 patients) or four cycles of AC + two cycles of EP (83 patients). RESULTS: Median follow-up is 72 months. All randomized and eligible patients are included in the analysis (AC: 80 patients, AC + EP: 78 patients). The five-year disease-free survival (DFS) for the AC + EP group was significantly better when compared to AC group (45.5% vs. 30.4%; P = 0.048). Again, the five-year overall survival (OS) of the whole group was in favor of AC + EP arm, though without statistical significance (68.6% vs. 59.1%; P = 0.247). CONCLUSION: Two cycles of EP following four cycles of AC decreased the relapse rate in operable breast cancer patients.",1
A randomized trial comparing axillary dissection to no axillary dissection in older patients with T1N0 breast cancer: results after 5 years of follow-up.,"SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Axillary dissection, an invasive procedure that may adversely affect quality of life, used to obtain prognostic information in breast cancer, is being supplanted by sentinel node biopsy. In older women with early breast cancer and no palpable axillary nodes, it may be safe to give no axillary treatment. We addressed this issue in a randomized trial comparing axillary dissection with no axillary dissection in older patients with T1N0 breast cancer. METHODS: From 1996 to 2000, 219 women, 65 to 80 years of age, with early breast cancer and clinically negative axillary nodes were randomized to conservative breast surgery with or without axillary dissection. Tamoxifen was prescribed to all patients for 5 years. The primary endpoints were axillary events in the no axillary dissection arm, comparison of overall mortality (by log rank test), breast cancer mortality, and breast events (by Gray test). RESULTS: Considering a follow-up of 60 months, there were no significant differences in overall or breast cancer mortality, or crude cumulative incidence of breast events, between the 2 groups. Only 2 patients in the no axillary dissection arm (8 and 40 months after surgery) developed overt axillary involvement during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Older patients with T1N0 breast cancer can be treated by conservative breast surgery and no axillary dissection without adversely affecting breast cancer mortality or overall survival. The very low cumulative incidence of axillary events suggests that even sentinel node biopsy is unnecessary in these patients. Axillary dissection should be reserved for the small proportion of patients who later develop overt axillary disease.",0
Leukemia in breast cancer patients following adjuvant chemotherapy or postoperative radiation: the NSABP experience.,"Since 1971, 8,483 women with primary breast cancer participated in seven trials evaluating adjuvant chemotherapy. Leukemia occurred in only three of 2,068 patients treated by operation alone. The cumulative risk was 0.06% after 10 years in those free of metastases or a second primary tumor, and 0.27% in those with tumor. Thus, leukemia is not an important factor in the natural history of breast cancer. Five of 646 women receiving postoperative regional radiation developed leukemia, an overall risk of 1.39 +/- .49% at 10 years. Twenty-seven cases of leukemia (0.5%) and seven of myeloproliferative syndrome (0.1%) were recorded in 5,299 patients who received L-phenylalanine mustard (L-PAM)-containing regimens. The maximum cumulative risk of leukemia in chemotherapy recipients (leukemia of any type and myeloproliferative syndrome) was 1.68 +/- .33% at 10 years following operation. The risk excluding those with myeloproliferative syndrome was 1.29 +/- .28%. The risk of leukemia in patients free of metastases or a second primary was 1.11 +/- .30% at 10 years, and when combined with myeloproliferative syndrome, it was 1.54 +/- .36%; risks not significantly greater than observed following radiation (P = .58 and .29). No cases of leukemia were observed during the 2 years of chemotherapy and none have occurred after the seventh postoperative year. Comparisons with the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results tumor registries (SEER) data indicate an increased relative risk of acute myelogenous leukemia following postoperative regional radiation (P less than .01) and adjuvant chemotherapy (P less than .001). The findings indicate that hematologic disorders are side effects of both radiation and alkylating agents used in the adjuvant treatment of primary breast cancer. The risk of such events is lower than that reported following treatment of other solid tumors and hematologic malignancies by chemotherapy. The benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer exceeds the risk of leukemia. Since chemotherapy is not uniformly beneficial, efforts should be directed toward identifying responders so that only those who will benefit are exposed to the risk.",0
Triple-negative high-risk breast cancer derives particular benefit from dose intensification of adjuvant chemotherapy: results of WSG AM-01 trial.,"BACKGROUND: This paper evaluates the prognostic and predictive impact of protein expression of various molecular markers in high-risk breast cancer (HRBC) patients with >9 involved lymph nodes, who received different chemotherapy dose-intensification strategies within a prospective randomized WSG AM-01 trial.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Paraffin-embedded tumors from 236 patients, who were randomly assigned to dose-dense conventional chemotherapy with four cycles of E(90)C(600) followed by three cycles of C(600)M(40)F(600) every 2 weeks (DD) or a rapidly cycled tandem high-dose regimen with two cycles of E(90)C(600) every 2 weeks followed by two cycles of E(90)C(3000)Thiotepa(400) every 3 weeks (HD), were available for retrospective central pathological review (116 HD/120 DD). Expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), MIB-1, epidermal growth factor receptor, and Her-2/neu was evaluated immunohistochemically using tissue microarrays. Results were correlated with follow-up data and treatment effects by proportional hazard Cox regression models (including interaction analysis).RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 61.7 months, 5-year event-free survival (EFS) as well as overall survival (OS) rates for the 236 patients were significantly better in the HD arm: EFS: 62% versus 41% [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.60, 95% CI 0.43-0.85, P = 0.004]; OS: 76% versus 61% (HR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.39-0.87, P = 0.007). In multivariate analysis, HD, tumor size <3 cm, positive PR, negative MIB-1 staining, and grade 1/2 were associated with favorable outcome. Interaction analysis showed that regarding predictive effects, triple negative (ER/PR/Her-2/neu) and G3 tumors derived most benefit from HD.CONCLUSION: Tandem HD improves both EFS and OS in HRBC. This therapy effect may be partly attributable to superior efficacy in the subgroup of triple-negative tumors and/or G3 with their poor prognostic marker profile.",0
Loco-regional recurrences after mastectomy in breast cancer: prognostic factors and implications for postoperative irradiation.,"PURPOSE: Potential risk factors including DNA flow cytometric-derived parameters predicting loco-regional recurrence (LRR) in early breast cancer were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 608 patients treated by modified radical mastectomy between 1982 and 1987. Recommendations regarding local treatment as well as adjuvant systemic therapy did not change during this period. Patients treated by adjuvant chemotherapy were randomized to receive additional medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) treatment. Only 59 (10%) patients received postoperative irradiation (XRT) to the chest wall and/or axillary lymph nodes; another 121 (20%) patients received XRT to the internal mammary nodes because of centromedially located tumours. RESULTS: Patients were followed for a median period of 7.5 years. The event-free survival at 10 years was 50%. The cumulative incidence rate of LRR at 10 years was 18% (n = 93), either with (n = 30) or without (n = 63) concurrent distant metastases. The chest wall, regional lymph nodes or both were involved in 41 (44%), 38 (41%) and 12 (13%) patients, respectively. Multivariate analysis according to the Cox model revealed two factors associated with LRR, i.e. pT (P < 0.05) and nodal status (P < 0.05). In node-positive patients extracapsular tumour extension (ECE) and pT were independent risk factors. DNA ploidy and S-phase fraction did not yield additional information. Based on pT, nodal status and extracapsular extension of tumour growth a high risk (> 10%) and low risk (< 10%) group for LRR could be identified. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that T-stage and nodal status, combined with ECE, may help to identify patients at risk for loco-regional recurrence, whereas DNA flow cytometry does not.",0
Tumor-specific VEGF-A and VEGFR2 in postmenopausal breast cancer patients with long-term follow-up. Implication of a link between VEGF pathway and tamoxifen response.,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) is considered a prognostic indicator for clinical outcome in breast cancer. Conflicting results nevertheless exist and there is a need for larger studies including untreated patients in order to clarify the importance of tumor-specific VEGF-A regarding prognosis as well as potential links to predictive treatment information. VEGF-A and its receptor, vascular endothelial growth receptor 2 (VEGFR2), were therefore analyzed by immunohistochemistry in postmenopausal breast cancers enrolled in a clinical trial where patients were randomized to adjuvant tamoxifen treatment (n = 124) for 2 years or no treatment (n = 127) with a median follow-up of 18 years. The tumors were arranged in a tumor tissue microarray system enabling parallel analysis of the angiogenic factors and hormone receptor status. Tumor-specific expression of VEGFR2 correlated strongly with expression of VEGF-A and progesterone receptor (PR) negativity, whereas VEGF-A was not associated with hormone receptor status. Among patients with estrogen receptor (ER) positive (fraction > 10%) tumors, there was a statistically significant tamoxifen response in VEGF-A negative tumors at both 10-year and 18-year disease-free survival (DFS), contrasting to VEGF-A positive tumors who had no beneficial effect of tamoxifen. A treatment-interaction variable indicated a marked difference in tamoxifen response depending on VEGFA-status in terms of DFS at 10 and 18 years of follow-up, p = 0.046 and p = 0.039, respectively. VEGFR2 status did not yield significant predicitve information for tamoxifen response in patients with ER fraction > 10%, whereas in patients with ER fraction > 90% both VEGF-A and VEGFR2 status were associated with tamoxifen treatment effect.",0
"Digital image analysis of breast epithelial cells collected by random periareolar fine-needle aspirates (RPFNA) from women at high risk for breast cancer taking hormone replacement and the aromatase inhibitor, letrozole, for six months.","Aromatase inhibitors are currently being evaluated as preventive agents in post-menopausal women at high risk for breast cancer. A phase II trial of 42 women on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) treated with letrozole for 6 months showed Ki-67 was reduced by 66% but showed no change in cytomorphology or Masood score. Subsequent image analytical procedures (karyometry) conducted on a subset of the samples captured subvisual information that showed reduced cellular abnormality after 6 months of letrozole. In the present study we expanded on the preliminary karyometry study to determine if the change in karyometric measurements corresponded to changes in risk biomarkers quantified in the Phase II trial; and secondly, whether these biomarkers might be used together to serve as markers of response in individual cases. Pap stained slides from the Phase II trial were used. Epithelial cell images were digitized on a CCD video-microphotometer and the nuclei were segmented from the field using a semiautomatic algorithm. Nine out of 37 cases analyzed showed a numerical decrease in all three markers, although only three of these exhibited changes substantial enough to be considered as an improvement. However, 12 cases showed improvement by cytology (a decrease in Masood score of at least 2), an additional 13 cases demonstrated a reduction in Ki-67 expression by 50% of the median baseline value, and an additional five cases exhibited a decrease of at least 10% in abnormal cells by nuclear morphometry. Thus, a total of 30 of 37 cases (81%) showed improvement in at least one marker. There was no correlation between changes in Ki-67%, karyometric abnormality, and Masood score change other than specimens that exhibited an improvement in cytology also displayed greater decreases in nuclear morphometry abnormalities. Given the heterogeneity of mechanisms leading to malignancy, the quantitative analysis of nuclear chromatin patterns may be valuable as a global, or integrating, biomarker of change in chemoprevention studies in conjunction with additional markers. Correlation with long term clinical outcome is needed to validate meaningful combinations of informative biomarkers.",0
Contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging underestimates residual disease following neoadjuvant docetaxel based chemotherapy for breast cancer.,"AIMS: We prospectively compared the ability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure residual breast cancer in patients treated with different neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen. METHODS: Forty patients with locally advanced breast carcinoma underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Twelve patients received 5-fluoro-uracyl-epirubicin-cyclophosphamide (FEC-group, six cycles), 28 (DXL-group) received docetaxel-based chemotherapy (six cycles DXL-epirubicin: 13 patients, eight cycles DXL alone: 15 patients). All patients had baseline and preoperative MRI. The spread of pathologic residual disease (PRd) was compared to preoperative MRI measures according to chemotherapy regimen. RESULTS: MRI over/underestimation of the spread of residual tumour was never superior to 15mm in FEC group, whereas it appeared in 11/28 (39%, 30-48%-95% CI) patients in DXL group (p=0.017). Tumour shrinkage led to single nodular residual lesions in FEC group, whereas vast numerous microscopic nests were observed in docetaxel group in pathology. CONCLUSION: Among tumours treated with a taxane-containing regimen, residual disease was frequently underestimated by MRI because of PRd features.",0
Response to medroxyprogesterone acetate (NSC-26386) as secondary hormone therapy for metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women.,"We have treated 40 postmenopausal women with documented metastatic breast cancer with medroxyprogesterone acetate. The average age was 63 years and the patients were, on the average, 14 years' postmenopausal. Only two patients had received no prior additive hormone therapy. The remainder had previously received estrogen, androgens, or both. Only two patients had objective evidence of tumor regression. In one patient a metastatic node disappeared for 7+ months, and the other patient had well-documented clinical improvement and control of brain mestastases for 22 months. Two other patients had mixed responses of chest wall metastases (regression of some but not all lesions), lasting 3 and 4 months respectively. Five other patients had obvious subjective benefit. There were four objective responses (10%) and five subjective responses (12%). There was no correlation between route of administration and response. All patients receiving benefit had previously responded to other hormones. Side effects were usually absent or consisted of mild fluid retention; however, four patients had disease stimulation from therapy.",0
Phase I-II study of dose intensified chemotherapy with filgrastim and thymopentin in patients with advanced cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Carboplatin (CBDCA), cyclophosphamide (CTX) and etoposide (VP-16) combination chemotherapy is active in many tumors. A phase I-II study was designed in order to verify toxicity, maximum tolerated dose and activity of CBDCA, CTX and VP-16 given with Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) and thymopentin (TP5), without bone marrow support. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A group of 12 heavily pretreated patients (PTS), 9 breast cancer, 2 small cell lung cancer and 1 gastric cancer, received fourteen courses of the described combination chemotherapy. Previous treatments were as follows: surgery in 10 PTS, radiotherapy in 7 PTS, chemotherapy in all PTS (median of 9 courses per patient). CBDCA, CTX, VP-16 were given over 3 days. CBDCA doses were calculated and expressed with the area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC). The dose range were as follows: CBDCA AUC 5.5-11 (400-800 mg/m2), CTX 1500-2500 mg/m2, VP-16 450-550 mg/m2, G-CSF was given 5 mg/kg/day from day 4 to day 17. TP5 was given, on alternate days, 1 mg/ kg from day 4 to day 30. RESULTS: 6 PTS developed fever > 38 degrees C for a median (M) duration of 4 days. 4 PTS required platelet support (M of 12 units) and 3 PTS red blood cells support (M of 2 units). Maximum tolerated dose was CBDCA AUC of 8, CTX 2000 mg/m2 and VP16500 mg/m2. No treatment related death occurred. Ten patients had responses and two had disease stabilisation. At the present time 5 PTS are alive and median overall survival is 13 months. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that dose intensified CT with the support of G-CSF and TP5 may be delivered safely and shows activity in heavily pre-treated patients.",0
"Ineffectiveness of levamisole in prolonging remission or survival of women treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and 5-fluorouracil for good-risk metastatic breast carcinoma: a Southeastern Cancer Study Group Trial.","A total of 97 women with good-risk metastatic breast cancer received therapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and 5-FU; half of these patients were randomly allocated to receive levamisole, 2.5 mg/kg, 2 days of each week in addition to chemotherapy, while the other half received an identical placebo. Good-risk patients consisted of those with bone-only metastasis, or local chest wall recurrence with or without bone metastasis. No significant difference in response rate, duration of disease control, or survival was observed between the groups. No major toxicity was associated with levamisole.",1
"retrospective analysis of topoisomerase IIa amplifications and deletions as predictive markers in primary breast cancer patients randomly assigned to cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil or cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and fluorouracil: Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group.","PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the predictive value of HER2 and topoisomerase IIalpha gene (TOP2A) for the efficacy of epirubicin in the adjuvant setting of breast cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group trial 89D, 980 pre- and postmenopausal primary patients were randomly allocated to either CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil; n = 500) or CEF (cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and fluorouracil; n = 480) times 9, between January 1990 and November 1999. Tumor tissue was retrospectively identified from 805 patients and was analyzed for HER2-positivity and for TOP2A-amplifications and deletions. RESULTS: HER2-positivity was found in 33% of the 805 investigated tumors and was not a predictive marker for epirubicin sensitivity. TOP2A changes were identified in 23% of the 773 investigated tumors: 12% had TOP2A amplifications and 11% had TOP2A deletions. We found that patients with TOP2A amplification had an increased recurrence-free (RFS; hazard ratio [HR], 0.43; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.78) and overall survival (OS; HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.29 to 1.13), respectively if treated with CEF compared with CMF, and that patients with TOP2A deletions had an almost identical hazard ratio (RFS: HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.36 to 1.11; OS: HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.30 to 1.04). This is in contrast to patients with a normal TOP2A genotype for whom similar outcome was observed in both treatment arms (RFS: HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.17; OS: HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.17). CONCLUSION: TOP2A amplification-and possibly deletion-seems to be predictive markers for the effect of adjuvant epirubicin containing therapy in primary breast cancer, but a final conclusion has to await a confirmative study or a meta-analysis.",0
Adjuvant tamoxifen for operable carcinoma of the breast: report of clinical trial by the Christie Hospital and Holt Radium Institute.,"A large controlled clinical trial with the admission of 1005 patients was carried out using tamoxifen as adjuvant treatment for women with operable carcinoma of the breast. Results were analysed for the first 906 evaluable patients randomised up to December 1981. After mastectomy premenopausal women were randomised to receive either an irradiation menopause or tamoxifen 20 mg daily for one year. Postmenopausal women were randomised to receive either tamoxifen 20 mg daily for one year or no systemic treatment (controls). Analysis at five years suggested that for premenopausal women there was no significant difference between an irradiation menopause and tamoxifen in terms of survival, local recurrence, or distant metastases. Tamoxifen had no appreciable side effects. For postmenopausal women there was a trend in favour of tamoxifen with regard to survival and incidence of distant metastases, and the difference became statistically significant for those patients with four or more positive axillary nodes. If long term results of these studies show only an improved quality of remaining life with tamoxifen, then this drug could be an important contribution to adjuvant treatment.",1
First-line Herceptin monotherapy in metastatic breast cancer.,"The pivotal phase II and III Herceptin trials proved the efficacy and safety of second- or third-line single-agent Herceptin and first-line Herceptin in combination with chemotherapy, respectively. In the current trial, 114 patients were randomized to one of two dose groups of first-line Herceptin monotherapy: standard dose of 4 mg/ kg initial dose followed by 2 mg/kg intravenous (i.v.) weekly; or high dose of 8 mg/kg initial dose followed by 4 mg/kg i.v. weekly. The regimen was generally well tolerated. A similar incidence of adverse events was demonstrated in the two dose groups with the possible exception of acute infusion-related events such as fever and chills as well as rash and dyspnea, which appear to be more prevalent in the higher dose group. The overall response rate was 26% and response rates were similar between the two dose groups (24% for the standard Herceptin dose group and 28% for the high Herceptin dose group). Subgroup analysis determined a higher response rate in IHC 3+ patients (35%) and FISH-positive patients (41%). When women with stable disease for > or =6 months were included with responders, the clinical benefit rate in IHC 3+ patients was 47%. Median survival was 24.4 months, which is comparable with the survival rate seen in the pivotal phase III combination trial (25 months). Therefore, single-agent Herceptin is an important new option for the first-line treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients.",1
A pilot study of amiodarone with infusional doxorubicin or vinblastine in refractory breast cancer.,"Increasing evidence suggests that P-glycoprotein (Pgp) expression can mediate drug resistance in refractory breast cancer. We studied 33 patients with refractory breast cancer enrolled in a pilot study of oral amiodarone as a Pgp antagonist given in combination with infusional doxorubicin or vinblastine. Whenever possible, tumors were biopsied and Pgp expression was assayed. Patients received either 60 mg/m2 doxorubicin over 96 h or 8.5 mg/m2 vinblastine over 120 h by continuous intravenous infusion. Beginning with the second cycle of chemotherapy, 600-800 mg amiodarone was given orally each day. Patients who experienced toxicity due to amiodarone but were responding to chemotherapy were placed on quinidine. Partial responses were observed in 9 of 33 patients on study and were sometimes observed after the first cycle of chemotherapy, before amiodarone was given, suggesting that some patients may have responded to treatment because of the infusional schedule. Toxicities were primarily the known side effects of the antineoplastic agents and of amiodarone. The major amiodarone toxicity was gastrointestinal, with nausea, vomiting, anorexia, or diarrhea being noted in 21 patients. Biopsy samples were obtained from 29 patients and in 21 cases, viable tumor tissue was present and the results were interpretable. Of the 21 samples, 9 had Pgp expression as determined by immunohistochemical staining; 12 were considered negative. The presence of Pgp expression was associated with an acceleration of the time to treatment failure. Whereas normal-tissue toxicities related to the combination of a Pgp antagonist with chemotherapy were not observed, amiodarone was associated with too many untoward effects to be utilized as a drug resistance-reversing agent.",1
Evaluation of salmon calcitonin treatment in bone metastases from breast cancer--a controlled trial.,"Salmon calcitonin 100 MRCU/day or a saline placebo were given in daily injections for at least three months to 49 patients with bone metastases from breast cancer in a randomized double-blind trial. All patients were normocalcemic, and most patients had stable or regressing disease at start of trial. No improvement in general performance or bone pain was detected as measured by a visual analogue scale, the daily duration of pain or consumption of analgetic drugs. Calcitonin had no effect on disease progression as judged by bone scans and radiographs. Calcitonin therapy did not affect serum calcium, alkaline phosphatase, bone gla-protein, or the urinary excretion of calcium and hydroxyproline. Serum phosphate and magnesium decreased significantly during calcitonin treatment (p = 0.01, and 0.00005, respectively). It was concluded that salmon calcitonin in this dosage has no discernible effect on skeletal pain, general performance, bone metabolism or disease progression in patients with breast cancer metastatic to bone. A significant decrease in serum phosphate and magnesium probably indicated an effect of calcitonin on the renal excretion of these ions.",0

Co-administration of GF120918 significantly increases the systemic exposure to oral paclitaxel in cancer patients.,"Oral bioavailability of paclitaxel is very low, which is due to efficient transport of the drug by the intestinal drug efflux pump P-glycoprotein (P-gp). We have recently demonstrated that the oral bioavailability of paclitaxel can be increased at least 7-fold by co-administration of the P-gp blocker cyclosporin A (CsA). Now we tested the potent alternative orally applicable non-immunosuppressive P-gp blocker GF120918. Six patients received one course of oral paclitaxel of 120 mg/m(2)in combination with 1000 mg oral GF120918 (GG918, GW0918). Patients received intravenous (i.v.) paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2)as a 3-hour infusion during subsequent courses. The mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of paclitaxel after oral drug administration in combination with GF120918 was 3.27 +/- 1.67 microM x h. In our previously performed study of 120 mg/m(2)oral paclitaxel in combination with CsA the mean AUC of paclitaxel was 2.55 +/- 2.29 microM x h. After i.v. administration of paclitaxel the mean AUC was 15.92( )+/- 2.46 microM x h. The oral combination of paclitaxel with GF120918 was well tolerated. The increase in systemic exposure to paclitaxel in combination with GF120918 is of the same magnitude as in combination with CsA. GF120918 is a good and safe alternative for CsA and may enable chronic oral therapy with paclitaxel.",0
Sequential bone scans and chest radiographs in the postoperative management of early breast cancer.,"A total of 241 patients with early breast cancer had serial bone scans and chest radiographs during the first two years of follow-up after primary treatment. Each patient had had a modified radical mastectomy and been found to have involved axillary nodes. They were part of a prospective randomized trial testing the use of L-phenylalanine mustard L-PAM as adjuvant chemotherapy. During the two years, these patients had a total of 832 serial bone scans and 1091 serial chest radiographs. Twenty-five patients (10.4 per cent) had bone metastases detected on sequential scanning, only 13 of whom, however, were asymptomatic at the time of the positive scan. Twelve (5 per cent) patients were found to have pulmonary metastases on routine sequential chest radiography of whom only 8 were asymptomatic at the time of the positive chest radiograph. It is concluded from this study that, apart from their usefulness in the monitoring of clinical trials, serial bone scans and chest radiographs cannot be recommended routinely in the follow-up of asymptomatic patients because of the low yield and high cost involved.",0
Factors predicting long-term survival for metastatic breast cancer patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy and bone marrow support.,"BACKGROUND: Poor prognosis of Stage IV breast cancer patients have at best a 10% 3-year survival rate with conventional chemotherapy. Dose-intensive chemotherapy improved survival rates for some of these patients. METHODS: All patients were Stage IV estrogen receptor-negative or estrogen receptor-positive hormonal refractory and received conventional chemotherapy (induction phase) to the point of achieving maximal response; if disease was stable or the patients responded, they entered high-dose chemotherapy (intensive phase). Seventy-six percent of the patients received two high-dose treatments with cyclophosphamide (4.5-6.0 g/m2), etoposide (750-1500 mg/m2), and cisplatin (120-180 mg/m2). Patients were randomized to receive or not receive autologous marrow. To identify prognostic factors for survival, univariate statistical analysis and multivariate models were applied to patient subsets. RESULTS: Univariate analysis identified a number of factors whose presence indicates improvement in overall survival rates. These include: (1) absence of liver relapse (P = 0.001); (2) absence of soft tissue relapse (P = 0.001); (3) a smaller number of metastatic sites at the time of detecting Stage IV disease (P = 0.026); and (4) disease-free interval greater than 1 year from initial diagnosis to Stage IV disease (P = 0.011). Multivariate models were fitted to the data, and three variables were identified as independent negative predictors for overall survival: (1) liver site (P = 0.001); (2) soft tissue site (P = 0.039); and (3) prior adjuvant chemotherapy (P = 0.028). CONCLUSIONS: Shorter survival after high-dose chemotherapy is predicted independently by patients pretreated with adjuvant chemotherapy, by disease distributed to the liver or the soft tissue.",0
A randomized trial of minoxidil in chemotherapy-induced alopecia.,"BACKGROUND: Hair loss is a side effect of many chemotherapeutic agents, and patients have even refused possibly palliative or lifesaving drugs because they could not accept temporary or prolonged baldness. Topical minoxidil has been shown to be effective for androgenetic alopecia and alopecia areata. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to investigate the value and safety of minoxidil in chemotherapy-induced hair loss. METHODS: Twenty-two women who were facing adjuvant chemotherapy after breast surgery were registered in a protocol that used a 2% minoxidil topical solution or a placebo in a randomized double-blind trial. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference (favoring minoxidil) in the interval from maximal hair loss to first regrowth. Thus the period of baldness was shortened (mean, 50.2 days) in the minoxidil group. CONCLUSION: Minoxidil decreased the duration of alopecia caused by chemotherapy. There were no significant side effects.",0
Intensification of adjuvant chemotherapy: 5-year results of a randomized trial comparing conventional doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide with high-dose mitoxantrone and cyclophosphamide with filgrastim in operable breast cancer with 10 or more involved axillary nodes.,"PURPOSE: To determine whether intensifying the dose of adjuvant chemotherapy improves the outcome of women with primary breast cancer and 10 or more involved axillary nodes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (n = 150) were randomized to receive either four cycles of standard doxorubicin 60 mg/m(2) plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks (arm A) or four courses of intensified mitoxantrone 23 mg/m(2) plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2), with filgrastim 5 g/kg/d from days 2 to 15, every 3 weeks (arm B). Disease-free survival (DFS), distant disease-free survival (DDFS), and overall survival (OS) were determined using life-table estimates. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in DFS (P =.44), DDFS (P =.67), or OS (P =.99) between the two groups at 5 years; DDFS was 45% (arm A) versus 50% (arm B), and DFS was 41% versus 49%, respectively. Five-year survival was similar in both arms (61% v 60%, respectively). Failure to note an intergroup difference in outcome was unrelated to relative dose-intensity. Analysis of patients with 15 or more positive nodes revealed a significant difference in 5-year DDFS (19% v 49% in arm B; P =.01). Toxicity was generally mild in both groups, with no toxic death. The incidence of febrile neutropenia was low (0.3% v 3%). Alopecia was less frequent in arm B (P <.001). CONCLUSION: This randomized trial confirms the feasibility of administering mitoxantrone 23 mg/m(2) with cyclophosphamide and filgrastim. Although there was no significant difference between conventional and intensified arms at 5 years, according to subgroup analysis, intensified treatment may decrease the risk of relapse in patients with 15 or more positive nodes compared with doxorubicin an cyclophosphamide.",1
Screening for clonal hematopoiesis as a predictive marker for development of therapy-related myeloid neoplasia (t-MN) following neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer: a Southwest Oncology Group study (S0012).,"A serious complication associated with breast cancer treatment is the increased risk for development of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN). To determine whether dose-intensive adjuvant regimens for breast cancer induce genetic damage to hematopoietic stem cells, defined by the emergence of clonal hematopoiesis, and whether detection of clonal hematopoiesis could be used as an early marker for the subsequent development of t-MN, the Southwest Oncology Group designed a pilot clonality investigation to estimate the incidence of clonal hematopoiesis during and shortly after completion of the dose intensive neoadjuvant regimens for high-risk breast cancer patients. Peripheral blood samples from 274 patients obtained prior to treatment, at time of surgery, and at 6 and 12 months post-surgery were examined by two different clonality assays: the HUMARA (HUMan Androgen Receptor) assay to estimate the incidence of early genetic damage by clonal proliferation, and microsatellite instability (MSI) testing to screen for LOH or defective DNA mismatch repair mechanisms. Clonal hematopoiesis was negative in 93.5% of the samples analyzed. Five patients showed a HUMARA-positive/MSI-negative pattern, and no patients showed a HUMARA-negative/MSI-positive pattern. With a median follow-up of 3.1 years, one patient in our study developed t-AML at 3 years 5 months after randomization. Our results indicate that clonal hematopoiesis assays performed within the 2 years following dose-intensive neoadjuvant therapy failed to identify an emerging clonal hematopoietic stem cell population. Longer clinical follow-up will be necessary to define better the positive predictive value of detecting clonal hematopoiesis in the HUMARA+/MSI- cases.",0
CXCR4 expression in early breast cancer and risk of distant recurrence.,"BACKGROUND: Chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) has been demonstrated to have a critical role in the early metastatic process. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of CXCR4 expression in primary breast tumors and describe correlations with the occurrence of metastasis in organs expressing the CXCR4 ligand stromal cell-derived factor 1 (i.e., liver, lung, brain, and bone). PATIENTS AND METHODS: CXCR4 expression in primary breast tumors was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 823 patients included in two prospective clinical trials. CXCR4 expression was considered positive when >1% of tumor cells were stained. The prognostic value of CXCR4 expression was assessed by a Cox regression model adjusted for clinical characteristics. We assessed the association of CXCR4 expression with the rate of distant metastasis to specific organ sites. RESULTS: CXCR4 was expressed in 92 of 794 primary tumors (12%). CXCR4 expression was not associated with clinical characteristics. CXCR4 was not prognostic for overall survival and showed a nonsignificant trend toward a higher risk for distant metastasis. CXCR4(+) tumors showed a significantly higher risk for bone metastasis. The 10-year incidences of bone metastases were 23% (13.6%-32.6%) and 12% (9.7%-15%) in CXCR4(+) and CXCR4(-) tumors, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that expression of CXCR4 in primary breast tumors is associated with a higher likelihood of developing bone metastases. This finding could open new avenues for the development of novel adjuvant strategies, including bone-targeting agents.",0
"Quality of life of postmenopausal women in the ATAC (""Arimidex"", tamoxifen, alone or in combination) trial after completion of 5 years' adjuvant treatment for early breast cancer.","The impact of treatment on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is an important consideration in the adjuvant treatment of operable breast cancer. Here we report mature HRQoL outcomes from the ATAC trial, comparing anastrozole with tamoxifen as primary adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal women with localized breast cancer. Patients completed the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) questionnaire plus endocrine subscale (ES) at baseline, 3 and 6 months, and every 6 months thereafter. Baseline characteristics in the HRQoL sub-protocol were well balanced between the anastrozole (n = 335) and tamoxifen (n = 347) groups in the primary analysis population. As with previously published results at 2 years, there was no statistically significant difference in the Trial Outcome Index of the FACT-B, the primary endpoint of the study, between treatments at 5 years. There were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in ES total scores. Consistent with the 2-year analysis, there were differences between treatment groups in patient-reported side effects: diarrhea (anastrozole 3.1% vs. tamoxifen 1.3%), vaginal dryness (18.5% vs. 9.1%), diminished libido (34.0% vs. 26.1%), and dyspareunia (17.3% vs. 8.1%) were significantly more frequent with anastrozole compared to tamoxifen. Dizziness (3.1% vs. 5.4%) and vaginal discharge (1.2% vs. 5.2%) were significantly less frequent with anastrozole compared to tamoxifen. In this, the first report of HRQoL over 5 years of initial adjuvant therapy with an aromatase inhibitor, we conclude that anastrozole and tamoxifen had similar impacts on HRQoL, which was maintained or slightly improved during the treatment period for both groups.",0
Randomized trial of tamoxifen versus combined tamoxifen and octreotide LAR Therapy in the adjuvant treatment of early-stage breast cancer in postmenopausal women: NCIC CTG MA.14.,"PURPOSE: Somatostatin analogs act directly on breast cancer cells and indirectly on insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels. This trial was undertaken to assess whether octreotide would lower insulin and IGF-1 levels and reduce risk of breast cancer recurrence. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The NCIC CTG MA.14 (NCIC Clinical Trials Group MA.14) trial randomly assigned postmenopausal women to 5 years of tamoxifen 20 mg daily (TAM) or TAM plus 2 years of octreotide 90 mg depot intramuscular injections monthly (TAM-OCT) as adjuvant therapy. The primary end point was event-free survival (EFS). Secondary end points were relapse-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), toxicity, and effects of treatment on IGF physiology. RESULTS: Among 667 women with a median follow-up of 7.9 years, 220 events occurred-108 with TAM-OCT and 112 with TAM. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs; TAM-OCT to TAM) were 0.93 for EFS (95% CI, 0.71 to 1.22; P = .62), 0.84 for RFS (95% CI, 0.59 to 1.18; P = .31), and 0.97 for OS (95% CI, 0.69 to 1.37; P = .86). Among patients with normal baseline gallbladder imaging, cholecystectomy was required in 23.0% of those receiving TAM-OCT but in only 1.4% of those receiving TAM (P < .001). At 4 months, TAM-OCT had significantly (P < .001) lowered IGF-1, IGF binding protein 3, and C-peptide levels. Older age (P = .02), tumor size (P = .001), nodal status (P = .01), high C-peptide levels (P < .001), and higher body mass index (BMI) in models excluding C-peptide (P < .001) were associated with poorer EFS in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Octreotide-related changes in circulating IGF-1 and C-peptide levels were statistically significant. Octreotide did not add significant clinical benefit. High C-peptide levels (surrogate for insulin secretion rate) and high BMI were associated with poor outcome.",1
A vasculature-targeting regimen of preoperative docetaxel with or without bevacizumab for locally advanced breast cancer: impact on angiogenic biomarkers.,"PURPOSE: Taxanes have effects on angiogenesis causing difficulties in separating biological effects of chemotherapy from those due to angiogenesis inhibitors. This randomized phase II trial was designed to evaluate the additional biomarker effect on angiogenesis when bevacizumab is added to docetaxel. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with inoperable breast cancer were randomized to either 2 cycles of preoperative docetaxel (D) 35 mg/m(2) i.v. weekly for 6 weeks, followed by a 2-week break; or docetaxel with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg i.v. every other week for a total of 16 weeks (DB). Plasma and serum markers of endothelial damage, dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), and tumor microvessel density were assessed before treatment and at the end of each preoperative cycle. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients were randomized (DB, 24; D, 25). There was no difference in overall clinical response, progression-free survival, or overall survival. Vascular endothelial growth factor increased during treatment; more so with DB (P < 0.0001). Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) also increased (P < 0.0001); more so with DB (P = 0.069). Intercellular adhesion molecule increased (P = 0.018) and E-selectin decreased (P = 0.006) overall. Baseline levels of VCAM-1 and E-selectin correlated with clinical response by univariate analysis. DCE-MRI showed a greater decrease in tumor perfusion calculated by initial area under the curve for the first 90 seconds in DB (P = 0.024). DCE-MRI also showed an overall decrease in tumor volume (P = 0.012). CONCLUSION: Bevacizumab plus docetaxel caused a greater increase in vascular endothelial growth factor and VCAM-1, and a greater reduction in tumor perfusion by DCE-MRI compared with docetaxel. Clinical outcomes of inoperable breast cancer were predicted by changes in VCAM-1 and E-selectin.",0
Lapatinib combined with letrozole versus letrozole and placebo as first-line therapy for postmenopausal hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: Cross-talk between human epidermal growth factor receptors and hormone receptor pathways may cause endocrine resistance in breast cancer. This trial evaluated the effect of adding lapatinib, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor blocking epidermal growth factor receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), to the aromatase inhibitor letrozole as first-line treatment of hormone receptor (HR) -positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Postmenopausal women with HR-positive MBC were randomly assigned to daily letrozole (2.5 mg orally) plus lapatinib (1,500 mg orally) or letrozole and placebo. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) in the HER2-positive population. Results In HR-positive, HER2-positive patients (n = 219), addition of lapatinib to letrozole significantly reduced the risk of disease progression versus letrozole-placebo (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.96; P = .019); median PFS was 8.2 v 3.0 months, respectively. Clinical benefit (responsive or stable disease >or= 6 months) was significantly greater for lapatinib-letrozole versus letrozole-placebo (48% v 29%, respectively; odds ratio [OR] = 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2 to 0.8; P = .003). Patients with centrally confirmed HR-positive, HER2-negative tumors (n = 952) had no improvement in PFS. A preplanned Cox regression analysis identified prior antiestrogen therapy as a significant factor in the HER2-negative population; a nonsignificant trend toward prolonged PFS for lapatinib-letrozole was seen in patients who experienced relapse less than 6 months since prior tamoxifen discontinuation (HR = 0.78; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.07; P = .117). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were more common in the lapatinib-letrozole arm versus letrozole-placebo arm (diarrhea, 10% v 1%; rash, 1% v 0%, respectively), but they were manageable.CONCLUSION: This trial demonstrated that a combined targeted strategy with letrozole and lapatinib significantly enhances PFS and clinical benefit rates in patients with MBC that coexpresses HR and HER2.",1
Trastuzumab plus vinorelbine or taxane chemotherapy for HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer: the trastuzumab and vinorelbine or taxane study.,"BACKGROUND: The optimal trastuzumab-based chemotherapy regimen for HER2-overexpressing, metastatic breast cancer is not known. The trastuzumab and vinorelbine or taxane (TRAVIOTA) study was a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial that was designed to compare these regimens. METHODS: Eligible patients had HER2-overexpressing, metastatic breast cancer and had received no prior chemotherapy for advanced disease. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either trastuzumab with weekly vinorelbine therapy or weekly taxane therapy (paclitaxel or docetaxel at the investigator's choice). Originally planned for 250 patients, the study was closed because of poor accrual with 81 evaluable patients, including 41 patients who received vinorelbine and 40 patients who received taxane. RESULTS: Response rates were 51% and 40% for the vinorelbine/trastuzumab arm and the taxane/trastuzumab arm, respectively (Fisher exact test; P = .37). The median time to disease progression was 8.5 months and 6.0 months for the vinorelbine- and taxane-based arms, respectively (log-rank test; P = .09). Treatment with either regimen generally was well tolerated, yielding comparable rates of neurologic and gastrointestinal toxicity. Vinorelbine-based treatment was associated with more anemia and neutropenia and with 2 episodes of cardiotoxicity. Taxane-based therapy was associated with more dermatologic toxicity, myalgias, and fluid retention. CONCLUSIONS: Both vinorelbine/trastuzumab and taxane/trastuzumab treatments were active as first-line therapy for HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer and had comparable rates of efficacy and tolerability. The toxicities observed were the result of recognized side effects associated with each of the chemotherapy agents and schedules. These data can inform treatment decision making in this clinical setting.",1
Cyclin D1 overexpression is a negative predictive factor for tamoxifen response in postmenopausal breast cancer patients.,"Antioestrogen treatment by tamoxifen is a well-established adjuvant therapy for oestrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha) positive breast cancer. Despite ERalpha expression some tumours do not respond to tamoxifen and we therefore delineated the potential link between the cell cycle regulator and ERalpha co-factor, cyclin D1, and tamoxifen response in a material of 167 postmenopausal breast cancers arranged in a tissue array. The patients had been randomised to 2 years of tamoxifen treatment or no treatment and the median follow-up time was 18 years. Interestingly in the 55 strongly ERalpha positive samples with moderate or low cyclin D1 levels, patients responded to tamoxifen treatment whereas the 46 patients with highly ERalpha positive and cyclin D1 overexpressing tumours did not show any difference in survival between tamoxifen and no treatment. Survival in untreated patients with cyclin D1 high tumours was slightly better than for patients with cyclin D1 low/moderate tumours. However, there was a clearly increased risk of death in the cyclin D1 high group compared to an age-matched control population. Our results suggest that cyclin D1 overexpression predicts for tamoxifen treatment resistance in breast cancer, which is line with recent experimental data using breast cancer cell lines and overexpression systems.",0
Postmenopausal women who progress on fulvestrant ('Faslodex') remain sensitive to further endocrine therapy.,"PURPOSE: This retrospective evaluation of data from two randomized, multicenter trials examined whether tumor responses to further endocrine therapy were seen in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer who had progressed on both initial endocrine therapy, usually tamoxifen, and on the estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist fulvestrant ('Faslodex'). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A combined total of 423 patients received fulvestrant 250 mg as a monthly intramuscular injection. After progression on fulvestrant, some patients received another endocrine therapy. Responses to subsequent endocrine therapy were assessed using a questionnaire sent to the trial investigators. Best responses were classified as a complete or partial response (CR or PR), stable disease (SD) lasting > or = 24 weeks, or disease progression. RESULTS: Follow-up data were available for 54 patients who derived clinical benefit (CB, defined as CR, PR or SD) from fulvestrant and who received subsequent endocrine therapy, resulting in a PR in 4 patients, SD in 21 patients, and disease progression in 29 patients. Data were available for 51 patients who derived no CB from fulvestrant and who received further endocrine therapy, resulting in a PR in 1 patient, SD in 17 patients, and disease progression in 33 patients. Aromatase inhibitors were used as subsequent endocrine therapy in > 80% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: After progression on fulvestrant, patients may retain sensitivity to other endocrine agents. Fulvestrant provides an additional option to existing endocrine therapies for the treatment of advanced or metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women, and may provide the opportunity to extend the sequence of endocrine regimens before cytotoxic chemotherapy is required.",0
Estrogenic effects of toremifene and tamoxifen in postmenopausal breast cancer patients.,"Intrinsic estrogenicities of the selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) toremifene 60 mg daily or 200 mg daily and tamoxifen 20 mg daily (TOR60, TOR200 and TAM20) were compared in a randomized clinical study in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer. The study was open label in three parallel groups. Variables for analysis were serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), estradiol (E2), antithrombin III (AT III), aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) and vaginal cytology. Clinical efficacy and safety have been reported earlier. A total of 648 patients were randomized (221 to TOR60, 212 to TOR200 and 215 to TAM20). Sera were available for the analysis from 148, 165 and 156 and for vaginal cytology from 98, 93 and 86 patients, respectively. All treatment regimens showed tissue-specific and dose-dependent estrogen agonist effect. In the primary measure of in vivo estrogenicity, effect on hypothalamus-pituitary-axis, all three treatment regimens decreased serum FSH (p < 0.001). TOR200 was more potent than the two other treatments (p < 0.05), but surprisingly, TAM20 was more estrogenic than TOR60 (p < 0.001). As could be expected in postmenopausal women, the treatments had no effect on mean serum E2 concentrations and decrease of serum LH was similar to that of FSH. Estrogenic effect on the liver was seen as dose-dependent increase of SHBG with statistically significant differences between the treatment groups (p < 0.001). Trends of transient ASAT elevations in TOR200 group (p = 0.07) and in all treatment groups AT III decrease (p = 0.1) were seen in the beginning of the treatment. TOR60 or TAM20 did not have an effect on mean ASAT values, and AT III decreased in TAM20 group more than in the two other groups (p = 0.1 compared to TOR60 and p < 0.05 compared to TOR200). Estrogenic effects on vaginal superficial cells were higher in TOR60 and TOR200 groups when compared to TAM20 (p < 0.05). Toremifene and tamoxifen had tissue-specific and partially dose-dependent estrogenic effects in hypothalamus-pituitary-axis, in the liver and in the vaginal epithelium of postmenopausal women. In some tissues tamoxifen 20 may be more estrogenic than toremifene 60 mg/day.",0
"Dose and dose intensity of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II, node-positive breast carcinoma.","BACKGROUND: Adjuvant chemotherapy is widely used for breast cancer and is known to extend survival. Some clinicians seek a greater survival benefit by increasing the intensity of the dose, whereas others lower it to diminish toxicity. METHODS: The Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) conducted a randomized trial of different levels of doses and dose intensity (dose per unit of time) of adjuvant chemotherapy in 1572 women with node-positive, stage II breast cancer who were assigned to three treatment groups. One group received 400 mg of cyclophosphamide per square meter of body-surface area and 40 mg of doxorubicin per square meter once every 28 days and 400 mg of fluorouracil per square meter twice every 28 days, for six cycles. Another group received 50 percent higher doses of the three drugs (600 mg, 60 mg, and 600 mg, respectively) but for only four cycles, so that the total dose was identical in these two groups but the dose intensity was higher in the first. The third group of women received half the total dose used in the other two groups and at half the dose intensity used in the second group. RESULTS: After a median of 3.4 years of follow-up, the women treated with a high or moderate dose intensity had significantly longer disease-free survival (P < 0.001) and overall survival (P = 0.004) than those treated with a low dose intensity, in three-way log-rank comparisons. However, the difference in survival between the two groups treated with a moderate or high dose intensity was not significant. These results are consistent with either a dose-response effect or a threshold level of the dose or dose intensity. CONCLUSIONS: The doses of chemotherapy used to treat breast cancer, especially early breast cancer, should not be reduced if the maximal benefit is to be achieved.",1
Gamma probe sentinel node localization and biopsy in breast cancer patients treated with a neoadjuvant chemotherapy scheme.,"The aim of this study was to analyse the accuracy of scintigraphic and gamma probe sentinel node (SN) localization in breast cancer patients who have been submitted to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NC). Seventy-six patients with single breast cancer were included in the study, and were classified into two groups. Group 1 consisted of 40 women who had received NC, and Group 2 consisted of 36 women who did not receive NC. All patients received 111 MBq (3 mCi) of 99Tcm-nanocolloid in 3 ml, by peritumoural injection. Anterior and lateral thoracic scans were obtained 2 h post-injection. The following day (18-24 h post-injection) the patients underwent surgery and sentinel nodes were localized by using a gamma probe. Complete axillary lymph node dissection was performed in all patients. Histological analysis included haematoxylin-eosin in all cases and immunohistochemistry in 10 cases. In Group 1, SNs were localized in 36/40 patients, histological analysis was performed in 34 and there were four false negatives (22%). In Group 2, SNs were localized in 32/36 patients, histological analysis was performed in 29 and there were two false negatives (9%). Predictive negative values were 78% and 90% in Groups 1 and 2, respectively. In summary, sentinel node localization in breast cancer patients submitted to previous neoadjuvant chemotherapy is less accurate than in patients who do not receive this therapy. The procedure is not sufficiently accurate to localize the sentinel node, thus it cannot be recommended in these patients.",0
Randomized comparison of tamoxifen and two separate doses of toremifene in postmenopausal patients with metastatic breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: To perform a randomized three-arm comparison of tamoxifen (TAM; 20 mg/d) and two separate doses of toremifene (TOR; 60 mg/d [TOR60] and 200 mg/d [TOR200]) in postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive or -unknown metastatic breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six hundred forty-eight patients with hormone receptor-positive or -unknown metastatic breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive TAM (n = 215), TOR60 (n = 221), or TOR200 (n = 212). RESULTS: The combined response rates (by intent to treat) were as follows;: TAM, 44%; TOR60, 50%; and TOR200, 48%. Complete and partial response rates were as follows: TAM, 19%; TOR60, 21%, and TOR200, 23% (not statistically different). Median times to progression and overall survival were not significantly different. Adverse events (lethal, serious but nonlethal, and important but non-life-threatening) were similar in all three arms, except that patients in the TOR200 arm had a statistically significantly increased rate of nausea (37% v 26% and 26% for TOR200, TAM, and TOR60, respectively; P = .027). Quality-of-life assessments were not different among the three arms. CONCLUSION: The activity, toxicity, and side effects of TOR in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive or -unknown metastatic breast cancer are similar if not equivalent to those of TAM. We detected no clear evidence of a dose-response effect for TOR. TOR60 is an effective and safe agent for the treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer and can be considered an alternative to TAM as first-line treatment for such patients.",1
Extended adjuvant therapy with anastrozole among postmenopausal breast cancer patients: results from the randomized Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group Trial 6a.,"BACKGROUND: Clinical trial data have shown that among breast cancer patients who were disease free after 5 years of adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen, further extended treatment with the nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor letrozole reduces breast cancer recurrence. We examined the efficacy and tolerability of extended adjuvant therapy with another aromatase inhibitor, anastrozole, for 3 years among women who had completed 5 years of adjuvant therapy.METHODS: Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group (ABCSG) Trial 6a is an extension of ABCSG Trial 6, in which hormone receptor-positive postmenopausal patients received 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen, with or without the aromatase inhibitor aminoglutethimide, for the first 2 years of therapy. For ABCSG Trial 6a, patients who were disease free at the end of Trial 6 were randomly assigned to receive either 3 years of anastrozole or no further treatment. Efficacy data were analyzed with the use of a Cox proportional hazards regression model with two-sided P values and Kaplan-Meier curves, and tolerability data were estimated using logistic regression analysis with odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).RESULTS: ABCSG Trial 6a included 856 patients. At a median follow-up of 62.3 months, women who received anastrozole (n = 387) had a statistically significantly reduced risk of recurrence (locoregional recurrence, contralateral breast cancer, or distant metastasis) compared with women who received no further treatment (n = 469; hazard ratio = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.40 to 0.96, P = .031). Anastrozole was well tolerated, and no unexpected adverse events were reported.CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm the benefit of extending adjuvant tamoxifen therapy beyond 5 years with anastrozole compared with no further treatment. Further research is required to define the optimum length of extended adjuvant therapy and to investigate the possibility of tailoring this period to suit different disease types.",0
Locoregional radiation therapy in patients with high-risk breast cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapy: 20-year results of the British Columbia randomized trial.,"BACKGROUND: The British Columbia randomized radiation trial was designed to determine the survival impact of locoregional radiation therapy in premenopausal patients with lymph node-positive breast cancer treated by modified radical mastectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy. Three hundred eighteen patients were assigned to receive no further therapy or radiation therapy (37.5 Gy in 16 fractions). Previous analysis at the 15-year follow-up showed that radiation therapy was associated with a statistically significant improvement in breast cancer survival but that improvement in overall survival was of only borderline statistical significance. We report the analysis of data from the 20-year follow-up. METHODS: Survival was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Relative risk estimates were calculated by the Wald test from the proportional hazards regression model. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: At the 20 year follow up (median follow up for live patients: 249 months) chemotherapy and radiation therapy, compared with chemotherapy alone, were associated with a statistically significant improvement in all end points analyzed, including survival free of isolated locoregional recurrences (74% versus 90%, respectively; relative risk [RR] = 0.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.18 to 0.71; P = .002), systemic relapse-free survival (31% versus 48%; RR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.49 to 0.88; P = .004), breast cancer-free survival (48% versus 30%; RR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.47 to 0.83; P = .001), event-free survival (35% versus 25%; RR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.54 to 0.92; P = .009), breast cancer-specific survival (53% versus 38%; RR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.49 to 0.90; P = .008), and, in contrast to the 15-year follow-up results, overall survival (47% versus 37%; RR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.55 to 0.98; P = .03). Long-term toxicities, including cardiac deaths (1.8% versus 0.6%), were minimal for both arms. CONCLUSION: For patients with high-risk breast cancer treated with modified radical mastectomy, treatment with radiation therapy (schedule of 16 fractions) and adjuvant chemotherapy leads to better survival outcomes than chemotherapy alone, and it is well tolerated, with acceptable long-term toxicity.",0
"CT tumor measurement for therapeutic response assessment: comparison of unidimensional, bidimensional, and volumetric techniques initial observations.","PURPOSE: To compare unidimensional, bidimensional, and volumetric techniques for evaluation of treatment response in patients with liver metastases from breast cancer in a phase III clinical trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Helical computed tomographic (CT) studies in 38 patients with liver metastases from breast cancer who were enrolled in a phase III clinical trial were evaluated before treatment and at 6 months after treatment. Two subspecialty radiologists measured all lesions on transverse CT scans with use of electronic calipers according to both unidimensional and bidimensional criteria. Volumetric measurements were made by tracing individual lesions. Measurements of individual lesions were summed to obtain patient response, which was categorized as complete response, disappearance of lesions; partial response, greater than 30% decrease in tumor diameter (unidimensional), greater than 50% reduction in tumor area (bidimensional), or greater than 65% reduction in tumor volume (volumetric); disease progression, greater than 20% increase in tumor diameter, greater than 25% increase in tumor area, or greater than 73% increase in tumor volume: or stable disease (size response other than that of complete response, partial response, or disease progression). RESULTS: In 37 patients, there was concordant treatment response with use of unidimensional and bidimensional techniques. Volumetric measurement produced results different from those of the unidimensional and bidimensional techniques in 12 and 13 patients, respectively. In six patients with partial response per unidimensional and bidimensional criteria, the response based on the volumetric technique was stable disease. In two patients with stable disease per bidimensional and unidimensional criteria, the response was partial response by volumetric measurement. In four patients with disease progression per bidimensional and unidimensional criteria, the response was stable disease per volumetric criteria. CONCLUSION: Volumetric measurement of tumor burden gives different results for treatment response compared with that of the unidimensional or bidimensional technique in a considerable proportion of patients.",0
"Factors predicting for response, time to treatment failure, and survival in women with metastatic breast cancer treated with DAVTH: a prospective Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group study.","Six hundred twenty-four women with metastatic breast cancer were entered on Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) study EST 2181. Patients were treated with mitolactol, doxorubicin, vincristine (DAV), tamoxifen, and fluoxymesterone (DAVTH). Nine patients were canceled, and 114 were ineligible (half because of concomitant diseases). Among the 501 eligible patients, the overall response rate was 54% (14% complete response and 5% not assessable). The median time to treatment failure (TTF) was 9.0 months, and the median survival was 20.9 months. Multivariate models were fit on a randomly chosen half of the eligible cases and then verified on the other half. About half of the variables that were significant in the models remained significant in the verification data set. In the verification data set the variables that remained significantly associated with lower probability of response were three or more organ sites of disease and lack of nodal metastases; the variables associated with a significantly shorter TTF were liver metastases, estrogen receptor (ER)-negativity, and prior adjuvant therapy. The variables associated with significantly shorter survival were liver metastases, ER negativity, three or more organ sites of disease, and prior adjuvant chemotherapy. None of the variables in the data set had a significant influence on toxicity. The 125 patients aged over 65 years did not have worse toxicity or worse prognosis than younger patients. Ineligible patients had significantly less response but virtually identical TTF curves, survival curves, and toxicities. Therefore, patient discriminants are of paramount importance in predicting the outcome of treatment. Many of the current criteria for eligibility for entry on study may not be justified.",0
Pre-surgical study of the biological effects of the selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitor celecoxib in patients with primary breast cancer.,"Cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2) is implicated in the regulation of aromatase transcription in malignant breast tissue and has been considered as a potential target for tissue specific aromatase suppression. We initiated a randomised controlled pre-surgical study of celecoxib versus no treatment in women with primary breast cancer to determine the effects of COX-2 inhibition on markers of biological response. Postmenopausal women (50-80 years of age) with stage I or II, primary breast cancer, were randomised 2:1 to receive 400 mg/day celecoxib or no treatment for 14 days prior to surgery. A core biopsy was obtained pre- and post-treatment. Paired baseline and endpoint biopsies were analysed for Ki67, apoptosis, COX-2, CD31, estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR). Comparisons between the treatment groups were conducted using the Mann-Whitney test with a two-sided 5% significance. Of the 25 patients treated, 23 had evaluable data and 19 (83%) were ER positive. Overall the geometric mean change in Ki67, the primary end point, relative to baseline in the celecoxib arm was -16.6% (P = 0.056). The change in the no-treatment group was -8.1% (P = 0.24). There was no statistically significant difference in the change between the two groups. Celecoxib did not significantly affect apoptosis, COX-2, ER or PgR expression. There is only modest evidence for a biological effect of celecoxib in primary breast cancer. However, the trend towards a reduction in Ki67 in ER-positive breast cancer warrants further investigations in a larger cohort of patients.",0
Phase II study of tamoxifen: report of 74 patients with stage IV breast cancer.,"Tamoxifen (NSC-180973), a synthetic antiestrogen, was studied for efficacy and toxicity in patients with metastatic breast adenocarcinoma. Two dose levels were used, 10 mg bid and 15 mg/m2 bid, in separate groups. In the 10-mg bid dosage group, 30 of the 31 patients were considered evaluable for efficacy. Five complete and 11 partial responses were recorded, for an overall response rate of 53%. In the 15-mg/m2 bid dosage group, 44 of the 45 patients were considered evaluable for efficacy. Three complete and 16 partial responses were recorded, for an overall response rate of 43%. All 76 patients were evaluated for toxicity. Side effects were generally mild, consisting mostly of hot flushes, transient leukopenia, transient thrombocytopenia, nausea, and fluid retention. A high degree of correlation between response and positive estrogen-receptor assay suggests the value of the test as a means to select patients for tamoxifen treatment. The conclusion from this study is that tamoxifen used as a single agent is an effective drug with minimal toxicity for treatment of metastatic breast adenocarcinoma.",1
Prognostic and predictive value of HER2 extracellular domain in metastatic breast cancer treated with lapatinib and paclitaxel in a randomized phase III study.,"PURPOSE: The HER2 extracellular domain (ECD) is enzymatically cleaved from the cell membrane. Shed ECD in serum has been studied as both prognostic and predictive markers. Lapatinib is a dual inhibitor of HER2 and epidermal growth factor receptor kinases. We examined the prognostic and predictive role of HER2 ECD in a randomized trial of paclitaxel with placebo or lapatinib in women with HER2-negative or -unknown breast cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (n = 579) with newly diagnosed metastatic breast cancer (MBC) were randomly assigned to paclitaxel with placebo or lapatinib. HER2 status was determined centrally. ECD was centrally measured by enzyme linked immunoassay in available samples at baseline (b; n = 472), week 9, and every 12 weeks thereafter. Results were correlated to overall response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS).RESULTS: Elevated baseline ECD (bECD) levels (>or= 16 ng/mL) did not predict HER2 tumor status (sensitivity, 62%; specificity, 75%). In HER2-negative tumors, elevated bECD was not correlated with improved efficacy for lapatinib plus paclitaxel versus placebo plus paclitaxel (ORR: odds ratio, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.1 to 3.8; P = .365; PFS: hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.47; P = .797). ECD levels tended to decrease over time when bECD was elevated. ECD conversion from low to high was associated with worse PFS. Converting from high to low was associated with a better PFS. A consistently low ECD level had better PFS than a consistently elevated ECD. All associations were found to be independent of lapatinib.CONCLUSION: HER2 bECD does not predict lapatinib benefit in patients with HER2-negative MBC. Changes in ECD status correlates with patient outcome regardless of treatment given. Measuring HER2 ECD is not currently recommended for predicting benefit to lapatinib.",0
"Conventional adjuvant chemotherapy versus single-cycle, autograft-supported, high-dose, late-intensification chemotherapy in high-risk breast cancer patients: a randomized trial.","BACKGROUND: Breast cancer patients with four or more positive axillary lymph nodes who are treated with conventional adjuvant therapy have a poor prognosis. In uncontrolled studies, high-dose chemotherapy produced much better results than conventional therapy. We compared the benefits of a single cycle of high-dose chemotherapy and the benefits of conventional chemotherapy in patients with high-risk breast cancer in a prospective, unblinded, randomized trial. METHODS: Between February 23, 1995, and June 29, 1999, 605 patients with breast cancer who had four or more positive lymph nodes were randomly assigned to treatment (307 to high-dose therapy and 298 to conventional therapy). The conventional chemotherapy regimen was four cycles of doxorubicin (75 mg/m2) followed by eight cycles of CMF (cyclophosphamide [600 mg/m2], methotrexate [50 mg/m2], and 5-fluorouracil [600 mg/m2]), all given intravenously on day 1 of a 21-day cycle. The high-dose regimen was four cycles of doxorubicin (75 mg/m2), followed by a single cycle of intermediate-dose cyclophosphamide (4000 mg/m2) supported by filgrastim (300 microg/day) for up to 10 days followed by high-dose cyclophosphamide (6000 mg/m2) and thiotepa (800 mg/m2). Peripheral blood progenitor cells were harvested by leukapheresis after treatment with cyclophosphamide and filgrastim and then re-infused after the high-dose cycle. Log-rank tests were used to compare survival rates. All statistical analyses were two-sided. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 6 years, no statistically significant differences were detected between the arms in 5-year relapse-free survival (high-dose arm = 57%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 51% to 63%; conventional-dose arm = 54%, 95% CI = 48% to 61% (P =.73) or in 5-year overall survival (high-dose arm = 62%, 95% CI = 56% to 68%; conventional-dose arm = 64%, 95% CI = 57% to 70%) (P =.38). CONCLUSION: Autograft-supported, high-dose therapy is not superior to conventional chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer who have multiple involved lymph nodes. This conclusion should be viewed in the context of improving the success of conventional chemotherapy.",1
Prediction of response to neoadjuvant chemoendocrine therapy in primary breast carcinomas.,"Our aim was to determine whether biological molecular markers can predict response to neoadjuvant chemoendocrine therapy in patients with early breast cancer. Ninety patients (median age 56 years; range, 28-69 years) with primary operable breast carcinoma were studied. They were treated with four 3-weekly cycles of chemotherapy with mitozantrone, methotrexate (+/- mitomycin C), and tamoxifen prior to surgery. Fine-needle aspiration was used to obtain samples from patients prior to therapy, and the following parameters were assessed: estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), p53, Ki67, Bcl-2, and c-erbB-2 measured by immunocytochemistry, and ploidy and S-phase fraction (SPF) by flow cytometry. The tumors of 78% of the subjects responded (complete response, 9%; partial response, 69%) and 22% did not (no change, 20%; progressive disease, 2%). Response rates according to disease stage and patient age were as follows: T1, 74%; T2, 79%; T3/T4, 78%; age </=50 years, 76%; >50, 79% (P = not significant). Response rates for other parameters were as follows: ER-positive, 82%, and -negative, 70%; PgR-positive, 86%, and -negative, 71%; p53-positive, 74%, and -negative, 81%; Bcl-2-positive, 85%, and -negative 61%; c-erbB-2-positive, 57%, and -negative, 93%; Ki67 high, 77%, and low, 81%; SPF high, 77%, and low, 77%; aneuploid, 71%; and diploid, 85%. Only the difference for c-erbB-2 was statistically significant (P = 0.007). A trend for higher response rates to neoadjuvant chemoendocrine therapy for tumors that were positive for ER, PgR, and Bcl-2 was observed but did not reach statistical significance. Tumors negative for c-erbB-2 had a higher response rate, which was statistically significant. In contrast, Ki67, ploidy, SPF, and p53 failed to predict for response.",0
Topoisomerase-II alpha expression as a predictive marker in a population of advanced breast cancer patients randomly treated either with single-agent doxorubicin or single-agent docetaxel.,"PURPOSE: The predictive value of topoisomerase-II alpha (topo-II) has been evaluated in advanced breast cancer patients randomly treated with single-agent doxorubicin or docetaxel. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Primary tumor samples from patients enrolled in a randomized, phase III clinical trial comparing single-agent doxorubicin (75 mg/m(2) q3wks) with docetaxel (100 mg/m(2) q3wks) were collected and topo-II status was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (clone KiS1). RESULTS: Topo-II status was evaluated in 108 samples, 55 (51%) in the doxorubicin arm and 53 (49%) in the docetaxel arm. An increment of 10% in cells expressing topo-II is associated with a statistically significant odds ratio (OR; 95% confidence interval) of 1.09 (1.03-1.15; P = 0.002) for overall response to doxorubicin versus 1.002 (0.94-1.07; P = 0.95) in the docetaxel arm. With increasing topo-II, the favorable OR for overall response to docetaxel compared with doxorubicin decreases to become not significant in patients with topo-II tumor content >10%. In a multivariate analysis, (a) HER-2 status seems positively correlated with overall response to chemotherapy (OR, 2.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.87-6.27; P = 0.09). (b) Overall response to doxorubicin is significantly lower than overall response to docetaxel (OR, 0.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.04-0.64; P = 0.009) but with a significant interaction term for doxorubicin-treated patients with topo-II tumor content >10% (OR, 8.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.86-37.03; P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: (a) Topo-II overexpression confers a higher probability of response in the doxorubicin arm only. (b) Despite being a small retrospective study, this study is in line with previously reported studies and the hypotheses raised are now being tested in a prospective neoadjuvant trial.",0
The effect of tamoxifen on bone mineral content in premenopausal women with breast cancer.,"Thirty-one of 62 consecutive premenopausal women with primary cancer of the breast completed a 1-year investigation period, receiving either 30 mg tamoxifen daily (15 patients) or placebo (16 patients). They were examined at the operation (t0) and at 3-month intervals (t1, t2, t3, and t4). Bone mineral content (BMC) was measured at operation and after 12 months. Fifty-six patients with benign tumors were included as healthy controls. All values of both cancer treatment groups and of the benign tumor group were comparable at the time of operation. BMC decreased significantly in both cancer patient groups when 12-month values were compared to the initial level (tamoxifen, -3.2%, P less than 0.001 and placebo -2.5%, P less than 0.01). However, no significant difference in BMC changes was noted between tamoxifen and placebo treatment. The serum phosphate was significantly decreased in the tamoxifen treatment group at each examination. In the placebo group, the alkaline phosphatase level increased significantly at each examination, whereas the serum magnesium fell at the 6- and 12-month examinations. All other biochemical indices of calcium metabolism were basically unchanged. It is concluded that BMC is reduced in metastatic breast cancer through osteolytic metastatic bone foci. Tamoxifen also decreases the BMC. It is, however, unclear if this effect is due to a progression of the disease in spite of the treatment or if it is caused by a direct action of tamoxifen on bone.",0
The relevance of intraventricular chemotherapy for leptomeningeal metastasis in breast cancer: a randomised study.,"To assess the benefit of intraventricular chemotherapy, patients with leptomeningeal metastasis (LM) from breast cancer were randomised to treatment including intraventricular (IT) chemotherapy (n=17) or to non-intrathecal (non-IT) treatment (n=18). Appropriate systemic therapy and involved field radiation therapy (RT) were given in both arms. Intention-to-treat analysis showed neurological improvement or stabilisation in 59% of the IT and in 67% of the non-IT group, with median time to progression of 23 weeks (IT) and 24 weeks (non-IT). Median survival of IT patients was 18.3 weeks and 30.3 weeks for non-IT patients (difference 12.9 weeks; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) -5.5 to +34.3 weeks; P=0.32). Neurological complications of treatment occurred in 47% (IT) vs 6% (non-IT) (P=0.0072). In conclusion, standard systemic chemotherapy with involved field RT for LM from breast cancer is feasible. Addition of intraventricular chemotherapy does not lead to survival benefit or improved neurological response, and is associated with an increased risk of neurotoxicity.",0
Verapamil increases the survival of patients with anthracycline-resistant metastatic breast carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: Verapamil (VER), a potent calcium channel blocker, has been found to overcome P-gp-mediated multi-drug resistance (MDR) and to increase sensitivity to cytotoxic anticancer drugs in refractory myeloma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The value of VER for treating solid tumors is still a matter for debate. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective study in 99 patients with anthracycline-resistant metastatic breast carcinoma (MBC), to assess the clinical effect of oral VER given in association with chemotherapy. Instead of retreating patients with anthracycline, we used a partially noncross-resistant regimen (VF), combining vindesine (VDS) and 5-fluorouracil given as a continuous infusion (5-FU CI). Patients were randomly assigned to two cohorts. One cohort (47 patients) was treated in 28-day cycles, each involving the administration of VDS (3 mg/m2 i.v. bolus on days 1 and 10) and 5-FU CI, (400 mg/m2/day i.v. from day 1 to day 10). The other cohort (52 patients) received the same VDS and 5-FU treatment and an additional oral VER treatment (240 mg/day divided in 2 doses), from day 1 to day 28 of each cycle. Patients were treated until progression. RESULTS: The treatment was well tolerated and no side effects that could be attributed to VER were detected. Patients treated with VER had longer overall survival (OS) (median OS: 323 vs. 209 days, P = 0.036) and a higher response rate (27% vs. 11%, P = 0.04) than those not given VER. Progression-free survival (PFS) was also longer but the difference was not statistically significant (median PFS: 4.6 and 2.7 months for the VER and non-VER groups respectively, P = 0.6). CONCLUSIONS: This clinical trial demonstrates that a chemosensitizer, such as VER, can increase the survival of MBC patients with acquired anthracycline resistance.",0
Identification of biology-based breast cancer types with distinct predictive and prognostic features: role of steroid hormone and HER2 receptor expression in patients treated with neoadjuvant anthracycline/taxane-based chemotherapy.,"INTRODUCTION: Reliable predictive and prognostic markers for routine diagnostic purposes are needed for breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We evaluated protein biomarkers in a cohort of 116 participants of the GeparDuo study on anthracycline/taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy for operable breast cancer to test for associations with pathological complete response (pCR) and disease-free survival (DFS). Particularly, we evaluated if interactions between hormone receptor (HR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression might lead to a different clinical behavior of HR+/HER2+ co-expressing and HR+/HER2- tumors and whether subgroups of triple negative tumors might be identified by the help of Ki67 labeling index, cytokeratin 5/6 (CK5/6), as well as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and Y-box binding protein 1 (YB-1) expression. METHODS: Expression analysis was performed using immunohistochemistry and silver-enhanced in situ hybridization on tissue microarrays (TMAs) of pretherapeutic core biopsies. RESULTS: pCR rates were significantly different between the biology-based tumor types (P = 0.044) with HR+/HER2+ and HR-/HER2- tumors having higher pCR rates than HR+/HER2- tumors. Ki67 labeling index, confirmed as significant predictor of pCR in the whole cohort (P = 0.001), identified HR-/HER- (triple negative) carcinomas with a higher chance for a pCR (P = 0.006). Biology-based tumor type (P = 0.046 for HR+/HER2+ vs. HR+/HER2-), Ki67 labeling index (P = 0.028), and treatment arm (P = 0.036) were independent predictors of pCR in a multivariate model. DFS was different in the biology-based tumor types (P < 0.0001) with HR+/HER2- and HR+/HER2+ tumors having the best prognosis and HR-/HER2+ tumors showing the worst outcome. Biology-based tumor type was an independent prognostic factor for DFS in multivariate analysis (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that a biology-based breast cancer classification using estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), and HER2 bears independent predictive and prognostic potential. The HR+/HER2+ co-expressing carcinomas emerged as a group of tumors with a good response rate to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and a favorable prognosis. HR+/HER2- tumors had a good prognosis irrespective of a pCR, whereas patients with HR-/HER- and HR-/HER+ tumors, especially if they had not achieved a pCR, had an unfavorable prognosis and are in need of additional treatment options.",0
Patterns of failure in a randomized trial of adjuvant chemotherapy in postmenopausal patients with early breast cancer treated with tamoxifen.,"BACKGROUND: We studied the effect of adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy in postmenopausal patients with resected early breast cancer treated with adjuvant tamoxifen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The trial included 835 patients with either axillary lymph node involvement, or tumors with histological grade II or III. They were randomized after local surgery to receive either tamoxifen (TAM group) or tamoxifen plus chemotherapy (TAM-CT group) consisting of six courses of 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (FAC), or 5-fluorouracil, epidoxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (FEC). Radiotherapy was given after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy in the TAM-CT group and after surgery in the TAM group. RESULTS: The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 73% in the TAM group and 79% in the TAM-CT group (log-rank test, P = 0.06). The 5-year overall survival rates were 82% and 87%, respectively (P = 0.06). The 5-year distant metastasis rates were 22% and 16% (P = 0.02), and the 5-year local recurrence rates were 6% and 4%, respectively (P = 0.23). There were no significant differences for contralateral breast cancer or other new primary malignancies. Chemotherapy tended to be more effective for patients who had tumors without estrogen receptors (trend test, P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Anthracycline-based chemotherapy administered to postmenopausal patients receiving adjuvant tamoxifen gave a borderline significant benefit on overall and DFS, mainly by a reduction in distant metastases. Delaying radiotherapy after six courses of chemotherapy did not affect local control after up to 10 years of follow-up.",0

"Effects of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells (regramostim), Escherichia coli (molgramostim) and yeast (sargramostim) on priming peripheral blood progenitor cells for use with autologous bone marrow after high-dose chemotherapy.","Peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) were collected without prior association with chemotherapy but after the administration of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-GM, regramostim), Escherichia coli (E. coli-GM, molgramostim), or yeast (Yeast-GM, sargramostim) and used in conjunction with autologous bone marrow after high-dose chemotherapy in 69 patients with breast cancer or melanoma. The mean peripheral white blood cell (WBC) counts increased by 2.2 to 2.7-fold after regramostim, 4.5 to 7.3-fold after molgramostim and 4.3-fold after sargramostim. All patients underwent three leukaphereses. The mean (+/- standard error) total nucleated pheresed cells per kg x 10(8) were 4.15 +/- 0.56, 15.10 +/- 1.77 and 7.24 +/- 1.00 for patients receiving regramostim, molgramostim or sargramostim respectively. The mean (+/- standard error) granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units per kg x 10(4) mobilized into the PB were 8.75 +/- 3.63, 71.03 +/- 17.85, and 65.11 +/- 18.74 for patients receiving regramostim, molgramostim, or sargramostim respectively. The total mean (+/- standard error) CD34+ cells per kg x 10(7) collected by three leukaphereses were 3.28 +/- 1.62, 1.34 +/- 0.51 and 2.57 +/- 1.93, for patients receiving regramostim, molgramostim or sargramostim respectively. The use of either molgramostim- or sargramostim-primed PBPCs led to complete elimination of absolute leukopenia with a WBC count under 100/mm3 in 64% and 77% of patients treated, respectively. Patients receiving molgramostim-primed PBPCs required fewer red blood cells transfusions than patients receiving regramostim-primed PBPCs (p = 0.0062). Our data indicate that PBPCs collected without prior association with chemotherapy but after either molgramostim or sargramostim with autologous bone marrow support and GM-CSF shorten the hematopoietic recovery after myeloablative chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer or melanoma.",0
A high incidence of vertebral fracture in women with breast cancer.,"Because treatment for breast cancer may adversely affect skeletal metabolism, we investigated vertebral fracture risk in women with non-metastatic breast cancer. The prevalence of vertebral fracture was similar in women at the time of first diagnosis to that in an age-matched sample of the general population. The incidence of vertebral fracture, however, was nearly five times greater than normal in women from the time of first diagnosis [odds ratio (OR), 4.7; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 2.3-9.9], and 20-fold higher in women with soft-tissue metastases without evidence of skeletal metastases (OR, 22.7; 95% CI, 9.1-57.1). We conclude that vertebral fracture risk is markedly increased in women with breast cancer.",0
"Adjuvant CMFP versus CMFP plus tamoxifen versus observation alone in postmenopausal, node-positive breast cancer patients: three-year results of an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group study.","After mastectomy, 265 postmenopausal patients with node-positive breast cancer were stratified according to pathologic nodal status and estrogen-receptor (ER) status and randomized to receive either 12 cycles of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, and prednisone (CMFP), or CMFP plus tamoxifen (CMFPT), or observation alone. Patients entered the study between March 1978 and July 1981. Cox regression analysis indicated that, compared to observation alone, chemotherapy (CMFP and CMFPT groups combined) led to a significant reduction in relapses by the end of the first year of study in every examined prognostic subgroup. However, after the first year the relapse-free survival curves of all treatment groups tended to merge, so that by three years 52% of the observation group and 51% of the chemotherapy groups remained disease free. Chemotherapy continued to show a significantly superior relapse-free survival rate for three years only in the subgroup of patients with ER-negative tumors (the subgroup with the largest relapse-free survival advantage at one year). The addition of tamoxifen produced no benefit or harm in any prognostic subcategory examined. ER status was prognostically important for predicting early relapse only in those patients not receiving chemotherapy, due to the greater effectiveness of this chemotherapy to prevent early relapse in the ER-negative subgroup. Treatment has had no early effect on survival. As breast cancer continues to recur even after ten or more years, later relapse patterns may alter these results.",0
Prognostic potential of DNA flow cytometry measurements in node-negative breast cancer patients: preliminary analysis of an intergroup study (INT 0076).,"An ancillary study (INT 0076) to the Intergroup clinical trial of node-negative breast cancer patients (INT 0011) was performed to retrospectively evaluate DNA flow cytometry measurements of ploidy (DNA content) and proliferative capacity (S-phase fraction) for their ability to predict time to recurrence. Of the 915 patients eligible for the clinical trial, 788 were registered for the ancillary flow cytometry study (INT 0076). Four hundred and three of these patients [estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, tumor size less than 3 cm] had been registered to the observation arm of the clinical trial and 385 (ER-negative and/or tumor size greater than or equal to 3 cm) had been randomly assigned to adjuvant chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil, and prednisone for six cycles) or to observation. Paraffin blocks from 95% (748 of 788) of these patients were obtained, 712 of which had sufficient cancer tissue to be evaluable for the flow cytometric assay. DNA ploidy status (DNA diploid vs DNA aneuploid) was evaluable for 565 (79%) specimens, 64% of which were aneuploid. Proliferative capacity was estimated by the percentage of cells having an S-phase DNA content, using a trapezoidal modeling algorithm(s) as previously described. The median S-phase value for the entire group (both registered and randomly assigned patients) was 6.97%, which defined the cutoff for interpretation of high or low S-phase values. With a median follow-up time of 4.55 years, S-phase fraction, but not ploidy status, is a significant predictor for time to recurrence in both the randomly assigned and the untreated population (observed registered group and observed randomly assigned group).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0
"Primary chemotherapy in breast invasive carcinoma: predictive value of the immunohistochemical detection of hormonal receptors, p53, c-erbB-2, MiB1, pS2 and GST pi.","Primary chemotherapy in operable breast invasive carcinoma enables tumour reduction and conservative surgery. In order to search for one or more biological factors capable of predicting tumour behaviour under primary chemotherapy, and subsequent patient survival, an immunohistochemical study was performed with specific antibodies to p53, c-erbB-2 (Her-2/neu), Mib1 (antiKi-67), pS2, GST pi, oestrogen receptors (ERs) and progesterone receptors (PRs). Core biopsies, obtained before primary chemotherapy, were available from a series of 128 breast invasive carcinomas treated between January 1985 and April 1989, with a median follow-up of 93.3 months. Univariate statistical analysis showed that negative ER detection by immunohistochemistry (IHC) was highly correlated with chemosensitivity (P = 0.001). A high percentage of Mib1-positive tumour cells (> 40%), as well as initial tumour size less than 4 cm, were also correlated with tumour responsiveness to chemotherapy (P = 0.009 and P = 0.03). By multivariate analysis IHC-ER, Mib1 and initial tumour size were independent predictors, the last parameter being the most important. Concerning subsequent patient survival, c-erbB-2 overexpression, as detected by IHC, was significant with respect to overall survival (OS) (P = 0.0006), disease-free interval (DFI) (P = 0.03) and metastasis-free interval (MFI) (P = 0.008) by univariate analysis. Furthermore, c-erbB-2 was the major independent prognostic factor for OS and MFI by multivariate analysis.",0
Is prophylactic breast radiotherapy necessary in all patients with prostate cancer and gynecomastia and/or breast pain?,"PURPOSE: We investigated the efficacy of prophylactic radiotherapy for gynecomastia/breast pain induced by 150 mg bicalutamide in a prospective, randomized, multi-institutional trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After definitive treatment for localized prostate cancer 125 patients were randomized to 12 Gy radiotherapy before bicalutamide as prophylactic radiotherapy (53) or bicalutamide only for nonprophylactic radiotherapy (72). The incidence of gynecomastia, breast pain and tenderness, and discomfort perceived by the patients was assessed by physical examination and direct questioning at 3, 6 and 12 months of followup. RESULTS: At the end of 12 months the gynecomastia rate was 15.8% in the prophylactic group and 50.8% in the nonprophylactic group (p <0.001). On patient evaluation the breast enlargement rate was 34.4%. The severity of breast pain and tenderness was not different between the groups. The breast pain rate was 36.4% and 49.2% by 12 months in the prophylactic and nonprophylactic groups, and the rate of patients who felt discomfort from gynecomastia was 11.4% and 29.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective study the incidence of gynecomastia was not as high as previously believed. Although prophylactic breast irradiation seemed to decrease the gynecomastia rate in patients on 150 mg bicalutamide, our study proves that not all patients need prophylaxis since only 52% were significantly bothered by gynecomastia. Thus, individual assessment is needed to select patients who need prophylactic radiation while on 150 mg bicalutamide.",0
Intravenous pamidronate in patients with tumor-induced osteolysis: a biochemical dose-response study.,"Bisphosphonates are used increasingly in normocalcemic patients for treating tumor-induced osteolysis (TIO) but little is known about the metabolic effects and the most appropriate therapeutic regimen. In 21 patients with breast cancer and TIO, we determined the biochemical effects of a single infusion of pamidronate given at 30 mg (n = 5), 60 mg (n = 5), 90 mg (n = 5), or 120 mg (n = 6). Patients received no other systemic antineoplastic therapy during the trial. We selected patients with baseline fasting urinary Ca/Creat (creatinine) > 0.105 mg/mg (median value of our normal range) and they were followed weekly for up to 14 weeks. The biochemical effects were maximal at day 7. For the whole group, mean (+/- SEM) Ca/Creat levels fell from 0.208 +/- 0.018 to 0.048 +/- 0.008 mg/mg on day 7 and remained significantly ( p < 0.01) lower than baseline up to day 56. Hydroxyproline excretion fell to a lesser degree, from 7.0 +/- 1.2 to 4.0 +/- 0.6 mg x 100/mg of Creat. The falls in Ca/Creat and hydroxyproline excretion were dose-related (ANCOVA, p < 0.05). Changes in serum parameters of calcium metabolism were, however, not significantly dose-related. Serum Ca levels fell from 9.3 +/- 0.1 to 8.7 +/- 0.1 mg/dl on day 7, but not patients developed symptomatic hypocalcemia, and the decrease within each dose group was significant only at 120 mg. Ca2+ levels followed a similar pattern. There was a slight increase in Mg levels and a pronounced fall in Pi levels, from 3.6 +/- 0.2 to 2.8 +/- 0.1 mg/dl. Intact PTH levels increased from 29 +/- 4 to 91 +/- 13 pg/ml and remained significantly (p < 0.05) elevated up to day 28.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0
Effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate therapy on advanced or recurrent breast cancer and its influences on blood coagulation and the fibrinolytic system.,"The effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) therapy on advanced or recurrent breast cancer and its influence on blood coagulation and the fibrinolytic system were compared among three different therapy regimens consisting of cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, and 5-fluorouracil (CAF) + MPA and CAF or MPA alone. A clinical response was observed in 42.9% (9/21) of the patients for CAF + MPA, 36.4% (8/22) for CAF and 23.8% (5/21) for MPA alone. No marked thrombosis or its prodromal condition was observed in any group. The effects on the test values for blood coagulation and the fibrinolytic system did not significantly change in the CAF group. However, both AT-III and protein C significantly increased above the normal ranges in the CAF+MPA and MPA groups. Increases in factor X, plasminogen, and alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor/plasmin complex (PIC) and decreases in fibrinogen, tissue plasminogen activator, and D-dimer, were all observed in the MPA and CAF + MPA groups, especially in the MPA group, although these changes remained within the normal ranges. The data indicated that MPA has various influences on blood coagulation and the fibrinolytic system, but these changes did not suggest activation of the blood coagulation system.",1
A randomized trial of five and three drug chemotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy in women with operable node positive breast cancer.,"Women with breast carcinoma and four or more involved ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes were randomly assigned to receive an induction course and 2 yr of maintenance chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF, 150 patients), CMF plus vincristine and prednisone (CMFVP, 166 patients), or chemoimmunotherapy with CMF plus the methanol extraction residue of BCG (CMF-MER, 85 patients). After 5 yr of accrual and a median follow-up of 34 mo, CMFVP is superior to CMF (p less than 0.01) with disease-free survival estimates at 4 yr of 60% for CMFVP compared to 45% for CMF. The disease-free survival advantage of CMFVP over CMF was greater in postmenopausal (p = 0.02) than in premenopausal patients (p = 0.09). CMF-MER was similar to CMF alone. CMF related side effects were similar in each regimen (see text), except for a greater incidence of leukopenia during induction with CMF than with CMFVP (p less than 0.01).",1
N0332 phase 2 trial of weekly irinotecan hydrochloride and docetaxel in refractory metastatic breast cancer: a North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) Trial.,"BACKGROUND: Because of the single-agent activity of irinotecan hydrochloride, combination of irinotecan and docetaxel treatment against metastatic breast cancer (MBC) should be evaluated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Single-stage phase 2 study of irinotecan and docetaxel to evaluate tumor response, toxicity, time to progression, and overall survival was carried out. Regimen of docetaxel (25 mg/m(2)) and irinotecan (70 mg/m(2)) was administered on days 1 and 8 of each 3-week cycle. Patients had histologically confirmed breast adenocarcinoma and metastatic cancer measurable with RECIST. RESULTS: Of 70 patients enrolled, 64 were assessable. Prior treatment with an anthracycline and a taxane was required. Eighteen (28%) patients [95% confidence interval (CI) 15% to 31%] had tumor response, plus four patients had stable disease (less than 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter and less than 20% increase) for >6 months. The clinical benefit rate was 34% overall. Median duration of tumor response was 6.7 months (95% CI 4.2-37.7 months); median follow-up was 18.6 months (range 8.5-37.7 months). The most common severe adverse events included fatigue [n = 16 (25%)] and neutropenia [n = 13 (20%)]. CONCLUSIONS: Weekly dosing of combination of irinotecan and docetaxel is active against MBC. However, the response rate to our regimen was not significantly better than single-agent docetaxel. Other schedules of irinotecan plus docetaxel should be considered for future studies.",1
Locally advanced/inflammatory breast cancers treated with intensive epirubicin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy: are there molecular markers in the primary tumour that predict for 5-year clinical outcome?,"BACKGROUND: Locally advanced and/or inflammatory breast cancer (LABC) is a heterogeneous disease. Molecular markers may help to understand this heterogeneity. This paper reports the results of a study assessing the potential prognostic or predictive value of HER-2, p53, cyclinD1, MIB1, ER and PgR expression by immunohistochemistry from patients included in an EORTC-NCIC-SAKK trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 448 patients with a cytological or histological diagnosis of LABC were randomised into a trial comparing two anthracycline-based neoadjuvant regimens. Chemotherapy was followed by standard locoregional therapy. Survival was comparable in both arms. We collected and analysed centrally paraffin-embedded tumour specimens from 187 (72.5%) of 258 patients that had a histological diagnosis. RESULTS: Of the patients included in this molecular marker study 114 relapsed and 91 died. In the multivariate analysis p53 positivity was associated with a shorter progression-free survival [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.96; 95% CI 1.33-2.91; P = 0.0008) and a shorter overall survival (HR = 1.98; 95% CI 1.28-3.06; P = 0.002). PgR positivity predicted for a longer overall survival (HR = 0.54; 95% CI 0.35-0.83; P = 0.0045). CONCLUSIONS: p53 was an independent factor predicting for survival. In order to clarify whether p53 is a pure prognostic and/or a predictive factor, a phase III trial is being conducted (EORTC 10994/BIG 00-01 study) using functional assay in yeast from frozen tumour samples.",0
Effect of age and radiation dose on local control after breast conserving treatment: EORTC trial 22881-10882.,"PURPOSE: To determine whether the effect of an additional ""boost"" radiation after breast conservative therapy (BCT) on local control depends on age and evaluate the impact of a treatment policy with a threshold for age. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used data from EORTC 22881-10882 trial, with median follow-up of 77.4 months. Patients receiving BCT and 50Gy whole breast irradiation were randomized to no boost and 16Gy boost (N=5318). RESULTS: In univariate analysis, a boost reduced local failure by a factor of 2 (P<0.0001). Multivariate analysis showed local control increased with age (P=0.0003). There was no evidence that the relative effect of a boost on local control depends on age (P=0.97) However in younger patients the 5-year local failure was higher, therefore the absolute reduction was greater. If the threshold-age for boost treatment were set at 40 years, 8.4% of the study population would receive a boost, resulting in a 5-year local failure of 6.1% in the study population. Changing the threshold-age to 60 years, 67% of the study population would receive a boost and the 5-year local failure would be reduced to 4.4%. CONCLUSIONS: In younger patients a boost dose resulted in a greater absolute reduction of local failure. The relative risk reduction was however similar for all ages. Applying a treatment policy with a threshold-age of 60 would result in 0.6% increase in local failure in the total study population, while sparing the boost to 1/3 of the patients.",0
Multicycle dose-intensive chemotherapy for women with high-risk primary breast cancer: results of International Breast Cancer Study Group Trial 15-95.,"PURPOSE: To compare adjuvant dose-intensive epirubicin and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy administered with filgrastim and progenitor cell support (DI-EC) with standard-dose anthracycline-based chemotherapy (SD-CT) for patients with early-stage breast cancer and a high risk of relapse, defined as stage II disease with 10 or more positive axillary nodes; or an estrogen receptor-negative or stage III tumor with five or more positive axillary nodes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred forty-four patients were randomized after surgery to receive seven cycles of SD-CT over 22 weeks, or three cycles of DI-EC (epirubicin 200 mg/m2 plus cyclophosphamide 4 gm/m2 with filgrastim and progenitor cell support) over 6 weeks. All patients were assigned tamoxifen at the completion of chemotherapy. The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 5.8 years (range, 3 to 8.4 years), 188 DFS events had occurred (DI-EC, 86 events; SD-CT, 102 events). The 5-year DFS was 52% for DI-EC and 43% for SD-CT, with hazard ratio of DI-EC compared with SD-CT of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.58 to 1.02; P = .07). The 5-year overall survival was 70% for DI-EC and 61% for SD-CT, with a hazard ratio of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.56 to 1.11; P = .17). There were eight cases (5%) of anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy (two fatal) among those who received DI-EC. Women with hormone receptor-positive tumors benefited significantly from DI-EC. CONCLUSION: There was a trend in favor of DI-EC with respect to disease-free survival. A larger trial or meta-analysis will be required to reveal the true effect of dose-intensive therapy.",1

Does famotidine enhance tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in breast cancer? Results of a randomized prospective pilot study.,"Thirty patients with breast cancer were prospectively randomized into case and control groups receiving 40 mg famotidine preoperatively for 10-14 days and routine premedication, respectively. Surgical specimens were evaluated objectively for tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in the center and in the periphery of the tumor along with evaluation of metastatic lymph nodes for reactive changes. Ten famotidine-treated cases (67%) showed significant lymphocytic infiltration in the center compared to 4 controls (27%) (p = 0.03). Eleven cases (77%) had significant lymphocytic infiltration in the periphery (p = 0.03) compared to 5 controls (33%). Considering both sites, lymphocytic response was significant in 9 (60%) cases as opposed to only 3 (20%) controls (p = 0.03). This response did not correlate with the stage, grade of tumor or menopausal status of patients in either group. Seventy-eight percent (78%) of the cases showed significant reactive changes in the metastatic lymph nodes as compared to 22% in controls (p < 0.01). This study suggests that famotidine enhances tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in breast cancer and might have potential as an immunomodulator. A larger confirmatory study is suggested.",0
Survival benefit with capecitabine/docetaxel versus docetaxel alone: analysis of therapy in a randomized phase III trial.,"In a large phase III trial of 511 patients with anthracycline-pretreated advanced/metastatic breast cancer, capecitabine/docetaxel combination therapy was shown to have significantly superior efficacy compared with single-agent docetaxel, including superior progression-free and overall survival and objective response rate. An updated survival analysis with >/= 27 months follow-up shows that patients receiving combination therapy maintained significantly superior survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.777 [95% CI, 0.645-0.942]; P < 0.01; median survival, 14.5 months vs. 11.5 months) compared with those receiving single-agent docetaxel. Following the failure of docetaxel monotherapy, 35% of patients did not receive additional cytotoxic chemotherapy. Among patients randomized to single-agent docetaxel, only those given poststudy single-agent capecitabine had significantly prolonged survival compared with those given any other poststudy chemotherapy (HR, 0.500; P = 0.0046; median survival, 21.0 months vs. 12.3 months, respectively). By contrast, poststudy vinorelbine-containing chemotherapy did not affect survival following progression on single-agent docetaxel compared with other poststudy chemotherapy regimens (HR, 1.014; P = 0.94; median survival, 13.5 months vs. 12.6 months, respectively). Among patients randomized to combination therapy, discontinuing docetaxel of capecitabine has a similar effect on survival (HR, 0.720; P = 0.20; median survival, 15.8 months vs. 18.3 months, respectively). Median survival was 18.3 months in patients who discontinued docetaxel and continued to receive capecitabine versus 15.8 months in patients who discontinued capecitabine and continued to receive docetaxel, with a trend toward improved survival in patients continuing to receive capecitabine. Although this is a retrospective analysis, these data suggest that the sequential administration of docetaxel followed by capecitabine is associated with prolonged survival in patients who are candidates for sequential single-agent therapy.",1
Survival benefit with capecitabine/docetaxel versus docetaxel alone: analysis of therapy in a randomized phase III trial.,"In a large phase III trial of 511 patients with anthracycline-pretreated advanced/metastatic breast cancer, capecitabine/docetaxel combination therapy was shown to have significantly superior efficacy compared with single-agent docetaxel, including superior progression-free and overall survival and objective response rate.

Although this is a retrospective analysis, these data suggest that the sequential administration of docetaxel followed by capecitabine is associated with prolonged survival in patients who are candidates for sequential single-agent therapy.",1
Breast cancer response to adjuvant chemotherapy in correlation with erbB2 and p53 expression.,"The expression of the erbB2 and p53 proteins was examined by immunohistochemistry in a series of 81 cases of primary breast carcinomas treated with an adjuvant chemotherapy with a median follow-up of 5 years. Expression of erbB2 was present in 19 cases (23%), 50% of them with more than 70% of positive tumoral cells. Expression of p53 was present in 32 cases (39%), 50% of them with more than 30% of positive tumoral cells; coexpression of erbB2 and p53 was observed in 11 cases (13.5%). Disease-free and overall survival of the patients were correlated with the number of positive lymph nodes (p = 0.08, p = 0.015). No significant trend was observed in response to adjuvant chemotherapy in correlation with erbB2 or p53 expression or both, whatever the level of expression.",0

Antiemetic effectiveness of ondansetron and granisetron in patients with breast cancer treated with cyclophosphamide.,"PURPOSE: The antiemetic effectiveness of ondansetron 8 mg i.v, ondansetron 32 mg i.v, and granisetron 10 microg/kg or 1 mg i.v. as prophylaxis in breast cancer patients regimens was studied. METHODS: Data from six U.S. cancer centers were collected retrospectively for 224 patients who received cyclophosphamide-containing therapy between January 1998 and June 2002. Logistic-regression analysis was used to examine the likelihood of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) both on an unadjusted basis and controlling for concomitant radiation therapy and dexamethasone use. RESULTS: Seventy-six patients (34%) received ondansetron 32 mg, 68 (30%) received ondansetron 8 mg, and 80 (36%) received granisetron (either 10 microg/kg or 1 mg). Patients receiving ondansetron 8 mg were 2.5 times as likely to have CINV on an adjusted basis as granisetron recipients (p < 0.01). There was no increase in the risk of CINV with ondansetron 32 mg compared with granisetron. Patients treated with ondansetron 8 mg required more rescue antiemetics and more prophylactic antiemetics in subsequent chemotherapy cycles than patients in the other groups. CONCLUSION: In a retrospective multicenter study, granisetron 1 mg or 10 microg/kg and ondansetron 32 mg appeared more effective than ondansetron 8 mg in preventing acute CINV related to cyclophosphamide therapy.",0
Immunology and adjuvant chemoimmunotherapy of breast cancer.,"Antibody against a breast carcinoma antigen was present in patients with breast carcinoma and other cancer more often (P less than .05) than in normal women. The incidence of antibody in women with breast carcinoma correlated with the presence or absence of gross tumor, and the titer of antibody paralleled the clinical course. These results suggest importance of a host-immune response to breast carcinoma. Fifty-seven patients with stage II carcinoma of the breast were entered into a prospective randomized adjuvant chemoimmunotherapy program of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil, and BCG vaccine +/- an irradiated allogeneic tumor cell vaccine. After 24 months of study, metastases occurred in two patients (3.5%) and a new primary carcinoma developed in the contralateral breast in two others, for an overall treatment failure rate of 7%. Adjuvant chemoimmunotherapy can delay early recurrence. Long-term follow-up is needed to assess the significance of these results.",1
Chemoendocrine compared with endocrine adjuvant therapies for node-negative breast cancer: predictive value of centrally reviewed expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors--International Breast Cancer Study Group.,"PURPOSE: To centrally assess estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) levels by immunohistochemistry and investigate their predictive value for benefit of chemo-endocrine compared with endocrine adjuvant therapy alone in two randomized clinical trials for node-negative breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: International Breast Cancer Study Group Trial VIII compared cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) chemotherapy for 6 cycles followed by endocrine therapy with goserelin with either modality alone in pre- and perimenopausal patients. Trial IX compared three cycles of CMF followed by tamoxifen for 5 years versus tamoxifen alone in postmenopausal patients. Central Pathology Office reviewed 883 (83%) of 1,063 patients on Trial VIII and 1,365 (82%) of 1,669 on Trial IX and determined ER and PgR by immunohistochemistry. Disease-free survival (DFS) was compared across the spectrum of expression of each receptor using the Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plot methodology. RESULTS: Both receptors displayed a bimodal distribution, with substantial proportions showing no staining (receptor absent) and most of the remainder showing a high percentage of stained cells. Chemo-endocrine therapy yielded DFS superior to endocrine therapy alone for patients with receptor-absent tumors, and in some cases also for those with low levels of receptor expression. Among patients with ER-expressing tumors, additional prediction of benefit was suggested in absent or low PgR in Trial VIII but not in Trial IX. CONCLUSION: Low levels of ER and PgR are predictive of the benefit of adding chemotherapy to endocrine therapy. Low PgR may add further prediction among pre- and perimenopausal but not postmenopausal patients whose tumors express ER.",0
Locoregional failure 10 years after mastectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy with or without tamoxifen without irradiation: experience of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group.,"PURPOSE: To assess patterns of failure and how selected prognostic and treatment factors affect the risks of locoregional failure (LRF) after mastectomy in breast cancer patients with histologically involved axillary nodes treated with chemotherapy with or without tamoxifen without irradiation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 2,016 patients entered onto four randomized trials conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group. The median follow-up time for patients without recurrence was 12.1 years (range, 0.07 to 19.1 years). RESULTS: A total of 1,099 patients (55%) experienced disease recurrence. The first sites of failure were as follows: isolated LRF, 254 (13%); LRF with simultaneous distant failure (DF), 166 (8%); and distant only, 679 (34%). The risk of LRF with or without simultaneous DF at 10 years was 12.9% in patients with one to three positive nodes and 28.7% for patients with four or more positive nodes. Multivariate analysis showed that increasing tumor size, increasing numbers of involved nodes, negative estrogen receptor protein status, and decreasing number of nodes examined were significant for increasing the rate of LRF with or without simultaneous DF. CONCLUSION: LRF after mastectomy is a substantial clinical problem, despite the use of chemotherapy with or without tamoxifen. Prospective randomized trials will be necessary to estimate accurately the potential disease-free and overall survival benefits of postmastectomy radiotherapy for patients in particular prognostic subgroups treated with presently used and future systemic therapy regimens.",0
Chemoendocrine therapy in advanced breast cancer.,"The effect of a combination of endocrine and chemical therapies has been studied during the past decade in DMBA-induced rat mammary tumors and advanced human breast cancers. Although interferential effects have been observed between endocrine therapy and chemotherapy in highly hormone-dependent tumors or cell lines, beneficial effects can be achieved from a combination of these two treatment modalities in human breast cancer when the steroid receptor status and the presence or absence of visceral metastases are considered in the selection of treatment programs.",0
Reinduction with the same cytostatic treatment in patients with metastatic breast cancer: an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group study.,"PURPOSE: To investigate the therapeutic value of reinduction with the same cytostatic treatment that had been used in induction treatment for women with metastatic breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred six women with metastatic breast cancer were given dibromodulcitol (mitolactol), doxorubicin, vincristine, tamoxifen, and fluoxymesterone (DAVTH) for 6 months of induction treatment, then randomized to receive one of two chemotherapy regimens if they had obtained an induction partial response (PR) or no change (NC), or to receive observation versus chemotherapy if they had obtained an induction complete response (CR). Patients were then retreated with DAVTH reinduction after relapse. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients were eligible or had minor reasons for ineligibility. Severe or life-threatening toxicity was documented in 46%, and lethal toxicity in 4%. Eighteen percent had a response on reinduction (zero of 16 induction nonresponders, 15% induction PR, 44% induction CR). The median time to treatment failure (TTF) from reinduction was 3 months, and the median survival duration from reinduction was 14 months. In a logistic model, factors associated with more reinduction responses were observation after induction CR (P = .002) and age greater than 55 years (P = .04). Time since induction was not significant. CONCLUSION: Reinduction of response after treatment failure remains a therapeutic problem. The need for better salvage treatment underlines the importance of developing new regimens.",1
Adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer: side effects and quality of life.,"In a trial of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy women with primary breast cancer and spread to one or more axillary nodes were randomised to receive a six-month course of either the single agent chlorambucil or the five-drug combination of chlorambucil, methotrexate, fluorouracil, vincristine, and adriamycin. On completing the treatment 47 patients were asked to fill in questionnaires at home on the side effects of treatment and its influence on the quality of their life. Side effects including nausea, vomiting, malaise, and alopecia had been severe enough to interfere with their lifestyle in 9 (42%) of the patients who had received the single agent and 19 (79%) of those who had received multiple-drug treatment. Various other side effects were reported by a few patients. Seven (29%) of the patients who had received the multiple-drug schedule voluntarily added that the treatment had been ""unbearable"" or ""could never be gone though again."" The proportion of patients who had experienced severe side effects while receiving the treatment was considerable; hence such adjuvant chemotherapy is justifiable only if it will substantially improve a patient's prognosis.",0
"Renal safety profiles of ibandronate 6 mg infused over 15 and 60 min: a randomized, open-label study.","BACKGROUND: Clinical data show that a single, 15-min i.v. infusion of ibandronate 6 mg does not significantly alter renal function. We evaluated the effect on renal function of repeated 15-min infusions of ibandronate 6 mg in women with breast cancer and bone metastases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to i.v. ibandronate 6 mg every 3-4 weeks for < or =6 months, infusion over 15 min (n = 102) or 60 min (n = 28). The primary end point was the percentage of patients with increased serum creatinine of > or =44.2 micromol/l. Blood chemistry was assessed at each visit. RESULTS: Two per cent [2/101; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2-7.0] of patients in the 15-min infusion arm and no patients (0/26; 95% CI 0.0-13.2) in the 60-min infusion arm had increased serum creatinine that met the primary end point. There were no clinically relevant changes in serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, or N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase, alpha(1)-microglobulin, or microalbuminuria. Most adverse events were mild or moderate. No clinically relevant changes were observed in vital signs, hematology, blood chemistry, or urine analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Ibandronate 6 mg by 15-min infusion every 3-4 weeks appear to be consistent with those renal safety profiles of 60-min infusion.",0
Peri-operative acute phase response and cytokine releasein women with breast cancer: modulation bypolyadenylic-polyuridylic acid.,"AIMS: Acute phase reactants (APRs) are believed to play an important biological role in trauma, sepsis and malignant disease. We have investigated the induction of the APR, C-reactive protein (CRP), by the biological response modifier, polyadenylic-polyuridylic acid (PAPU) during the peri-operative period. METHODS: Twenty post-menopausal women with breast cancer undergoing mastectomy were randomized into a double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group pilot study. PAPU (150 mg) or placebo was given intravenously the day prior to surgery (D -1), the day of surgery (D 0) and post-operatively on days (D 1, 3, 5, 7 and 14). Blood samples were collected on eight different days (D -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 18). CRP was significantly elevated in the PAPU group (P<0.05) on days 2 and 4, when compared with patients receiving placebo. The serum levels of cytokines believed to induce hepatic APRs, were also measured. RESULTS: The serum concentration of IL-6 was elevated on days 1, 2, 4 and 6 (P<0.05), TNF- alpha and IL-1 beta levels were increased on days 1 and 2 (P<0.05), respectively, while the serum level of soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) was elevated above the baseline on days 0, 2, 4, 6 and 18 in the PAPU group, when compared with the baseline. CONCLUSIONS: This modulation of acute phase response may have important implications for patients with cancer undergoing surgery.",0
Cyclophosphamide-metabolizing enzyme polymorphisms and survival outcomes after adjuvant chemotherapy for node-positive breast cancer: a retrospective cohort study.,"INTRODUCTION: Cyclophosphamide-based adjuvant chemotherapy is a mainstay of treatment for women with node-positive breast cancer, but is not universally effective in preventing recurrence. Pharmacogenetic variability in drug metabolism is one possible mechanism of treatment failure. We hypothesize that functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in drug metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) that activate (CYPs) or metabolize (GSTs) cyclophosphamide account for some of the observed variability in disease outcomes.METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 350 women enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, adjuvant breast cancer chemotherapy trial (ECOG-2190/INT-0121). Subjects in this trial received standard-dose cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and fluorouracil (CAF), followed by either observation or high-dose cyclophosphamide and thiotepa with stem cell rescue. We used bone marrow stem cell-derived genomic DNA from archival specimens to genotype CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1. Cox regression models were computed to determine associations between genotypes (individually or in combination) and disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS), adjusting for confounding clinical variables.RESULTS: In the full multivariable analysis, women with at least one CYP3A4 *1B variant allele had significantly worse DFS than those who were wild-type *1A/*1A (multivariate hazard ratio 2.79; 95% CI 1.52, 5.14). CYP2D6 genotype did not impact this association among patients with estrogen receptor (ER) -positive tumors scheduled to receive tamoxifen.CONCLUSIONS: These data support the hypothesis that genetic variability in cyclophosphamide metabolism independently impacts outcome from adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.",0
Effects of low dose tamoxifen on normal breast tissue from premenopausal women.,"The aim of this study was to determine the effects of low doses of tamoxifen (5 and 10mg/day) for 50 days compared with the standard dose (20 mg/day) on breast biomarkers measured in normal breast tissue from premenopausal patients. A randomised double-blind study was performed using tissue from 56 premenopausal women with a diagnosis of fibroadenoma of the breast. Excisional biopsy was performed on the 50th day of therapy. Normal breast tissue samples were collected during surgery. The patients were divided in groups: A (placebo, n=11); group B (5 mg, n=16), group C (10 mg, n=14) and group D (20 mg, n=15). In this cross-sectional study, differences in the expression of Oestrogen Receptor alpha (ERalpha), Progesterone Receptor (PR), Ki-67, apoptotic bodies and mitotic index between the different groups after treatment can be seen on the normal breast tissue. We believe that a lower dose of tamoxifen could reduce the side-effects associated with treatment without affecting its chemopreventive activity in the breast.",0
The induction of distinct cytokine cascades correlates with different effects of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor on the lymphocyte compartment in the course of high-dose chemotherapy for breast cancer.,"The availability of the myeloid hemopoietic growth factors (HGF) granulocyte- and granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF and GM-CSF) has enhanced the therapeutic index of high-dose chemotherapeutic antitumoral regimens (HDCT), as well as the rate of severe damage to immune competence. We investigated some immune functions before, during and after one course of HDCT for poor-risk breast cancer and compared the effects of G-CSF and GM-CSF on the immune recovery. They exerted different influences on the functions we examined and showed distinctive patterns of both qualitative and quantitative in vivo activities on the immune system. The main findings were that (a) granulocyte and lymphocyte recovery rates were faster in the patients receiving G-CSF; (b) looking at the lymphocyte compartment, this difference was restricted to the CD3(+)/CD8(+) and CD56(+) lymphocyte subsets; (c) the reconstitution rate of CD19(+) lymphocytes was slow in both groups; (d) at the end of follow-up HLA-DR expression by CD3(+) lymphocytes was higher in the GM-CSF group; (e) the lymphocyte proliferative capacity was restored at a faster rate in the GM-CSF group, whereas cytotoxic activities recovered better in the G-CSF group; (f) the early repopulating phase was characterized by higher interleukin-6 serum levels in the GM-CSF group. Overall, GM-CSF seemed to exert an earlier effect on all T lymphocyte subsets, preventing them from a complete drop during the long-lasting ""nadir"" of the cell count, whereas G-CSF appeared to boost them strongly, though a few days later, hastening their final recovery. The distinct pattern of the cytokine cascade induced by each factor, consistent with the different functional changes, seemed to account for the peculiarities of their immune modulations.",0
Efficacy and safety of trastuzumab as a single agent in first-line treatment of HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of first-line, single-agent trastuzumab in women with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred fourteen women with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive first-line treatment with trastuzumab 4 mg/kg loading dose, followed by 2 mg/kg weekly, or a higher 8 mg/kg loading dose, followed by 4 mg/kg weekly. RESULTS: The objective response rate was 26% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18.2% to 34.4%), with seven complete and 23 partial responses. Response rates in 111 assessable patients with 3+ and 2+ HER2 overexpression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) were 35% (95% CI, 24.4% to 44.7%) and none (95% CI, 0% to 15.5%), respectively. The clinical benefit rates in assessable patients with 3+ and 2+ HER2 overexpression were 48% and 7%, respectively. The response rates in 108 assessable patients with and without HER2 gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis were 34% (95% CI, 23.9% to 45.7%) and 7% (95% CI, 0.8% to 22.8%), respectively. Seventeen (57%) of 30 patients with an objective response and 22 (51%) of 43 patients with clinical benefit had not experienced disease progression at follow-up at 12 months or later. The most common treatment-related adverse events were chills (25% of patients), asthenia (23%), fever (22%), pain (18%), and nausea (14%). Cardiac dysfunction occurred in two patients (2%); both had histories of cardiac disease and did not require additional intervention after discontinuation of trastuzumab. There was no clear evidence of a dose-response relationship for response, survival, or adverse events. CONCLUSION: Single-agent trastuzumab is active and well tolerated as first-line treatment of women with metastatic breast cancer with HER2 3+ overexpression by IHC or gene amplification by FISH.",1
Levamisole in the treatment of stage II breast cancer. Five-year follow-up of a randomized double-blind study.,"The effect of levamisole combined with postoperative radiotherapy in Stage II breast cancer was investigated in a double-blind randomized study comprising 72 patients. All patients were followed for at least 5 years. Disease-free survival was slightly prolonged in the levamisole group as a whole. Among postmenopausal patients, levamisole significantly increased both disease-free and total survival (P = 0.003) and P = 0.008, respectively). The levamisole group also showed fewer distant metastases as the first sign of recurrence. Levamisole treatment was associated with a risk of granulocytopenia and agranulocytosis (10%), but, as in the authors' previous studies, this seemed to be totally reversible and did not worsen the prognosis.",1
Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy for liver metastases from breast cancer.,"Between 1985 and 1992, 56 patients with unresectable liver metastases from breast cancer were treated by repeated hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy employing an implantable port system. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) at 330 mg/m2 per week. Adriamycin (ADR) at 20 mg/m2 every 4 weeks, and mitomycin C (MMC) at 2.7 mg/m2 every 2 weeks were given to 42 patients. The remaining 14 patients received 5-FU at 330 mg/m2 per week and epirubicin (EPIR) at 20 mg/m2 every 2 weeks. As a rule, the treatment was performed on an outpatient basis. The side effects and complications observed included myelosuppression (41%), hepatic arterial occlusion (23%), and gastric mucositis (20%), but no major toxicity was encountered. The response rate (CR+PR) of the evaluated patients as determined from CT scans was 81%. The overall median survival period was 12.5 months. Only 14% of the patients died due to regrowth of liver metastases, and in 70% of the total cases, death due to liver metastases was avoided by this treatment. Thus, repeated hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy for liver metastases from breast cancer might be capable of prolonging the survival of patients via avoidance of death due to the liver metastases.",1
Impact of alopecia and scalp cooling on the well-being of breast cancer patients.,"OBJECTIVE: Chemotherapy-induced alopecia, a common and distressing side effect of chemotherapy, may be prevented by scalp cooling, which reduces toxicity of cytostatics in hair root cells. This is the first study designed to assess the effect of scalp cooling on well-being. METHODS: A prospective multi-centre study was performed in 13 hospitals. Breast cancer patients treated with (N=98) and without (N=168) scalp cooling completed questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC-QLQ-BR23, BIS, MBA, HADS) before chemotherapy, and three weeks and six months after the last chemotherapy cycle. RESULTS: Scalp cooling was effective in 52% of the cases. Alopecia was considered among the most distressing problems at all three moments of measurement. A trend towards higher well-being was found in successfully scalp-cooled patients, as indicated by a general better health-related quality of life and better body image, whereas unsuccessfully scalp-cooled patients reported lowest well-being. CONCLUSIONS: Scalp cooling contributes not only to the well-being of successfully scalp-cooled patients but also seems to cause additional distress when patients lose their hair despite scalp cooling. This might be related to disappointment due to alopecia despite scalp cooling or possibly to a general higher biological availability of cytostatics. We recommend additional support for patients when scalp cooling is not successful and to spend more effort to maximise the effectiveness of scalp cooling.",0
Advanced breast cancer: a randomized study of doxorubicin or mitoxantrone in combination with cyclophosphamide and vincristine.,"BACKGROUND: Drug selection for the treatment of advanced breast cancer is based on both efficacy and toxicity. Combination chemotherapy produces higher response rates than single agents, of which doxorubicin is the most active. This study compares efficacy and toxicity of the drugs doxorubicin and mitoxantrone when used as part of a 3 drug combination. Doxorubicin is the most active agent, but also one of the most toxic, and in this study was compared, in a 3-drug combination, with mitoxantrone with the aim of achieving comparable efficancy with reduced toxicity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 110 patients with advanced breast cancer previously untreated by chemotherapy were randomized to receive cyclophosphamide and vincristine, together with either doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 i.v. (VAC) or mitoxantrone 10 mg/m2 (VNC) for up to 6 cycles. RESULTS: Of 53 eligible patients randomized to VAC, the overall response rate was 55% (CR rate 17%), while of 55 patients randomized to VNC the overall response rate was 42% (CR rate 7%). The difference is not statistically significant (p = 0.07), but there was a trend towards a higher response rate to VAC in patients aged less than 60, those with nodal and soft tissue disease, and those with 2 or more sites of disease. The principal difference in toxicity was reduced alopecia in favour of VNC. However there was also an increased number of deaths within the first cycle in patients randomized to VAC. There were no differences in survival, relapse free interval, or freedom from progression between the two arms. CONCLUSIONS: Both VAC and VNC are effective regimens in advanced breast cancer. While the confidence limits in this study mean the response rate advantages of VAC could have arisen by chance, younger patients with adverse prognostic factors may warrant consideration of the VAC regimen.",1
"Phase I study of mitozantrone, methotrexate and mitomycin with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (filgrastim) in patients with advanced breast cancer.","The combination of mitozantrone, methotrexate and mitomycin (3M) gives a response rate of around 50% in patients with advanced breast cancer. The predominant toxicity is haematological. In this study, previously untreated patients were given 3M with increasing doses of mitozantrone (7-14 mg m-2) with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (metHuG-CSF) (filgrastim) to prevent marrow toxicity. Doses administered were 7 mg m-2 mitomycin i.v. 6 weekly, methotrexate i.v. 35 mg m-2 (maximum 50 mg) 3 weekly and mitozantrone i.v. 3 weekly as follows: 7 mg m-2, six patients (group 1); 10 mg m-2, six patients (group 2); 12 mg m-2, six patients (group 3); 14 mg m-2, six patients (group 4); all on day 1 for six cycles at the assigned dose. All patients received filgrastim (Amgen 0.3 mg ml-1) at a dose of 5 micrograms kg-1 subcutaneously daily on days 4-17 of each cycle. All treatment was given on an out-patient basis. A total of 24 patients were entered into the study. The median age was 63 years (range 48-75). ECOG performance status was 0 in ten, 1 in 11 patients and 2 in three patients. Locoregional disease alone was present in seven patients. The remainder had one or more sites of metastases. The actual dose administered to the 24 patients was as follows. The six patients in group 1 all completed six courses of treatment as per protocol. In group 2, three patients completed six courses, two stopped because of toxicity after one and four courses and one had progressive disease after one course. In group 3, three patients completed and three stopped early because of progressive disease. In group 4, two patients completed, one progressed after four courses and three responding patients stopped treatment because of toxicity. The maximum tolerated dose of mitozantrone in the 3M combination was 12 mg m-2. The use of filgrastim with increasing doses of chemotherapy prevents neutropenia, but other toxicities, namely thrombocytopenia and lethargy, then become dose limiting.",1
21-Gene expression profile assay on core needle biopsies predicts responses to neoadjuvant endocrine therapy in breast cancer patients.,"This study examined postmenopausal estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients who received prospective neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NAET) with tamoxifen or anastrozole to determine if the 21-gene recurrence score (RS) predicts NAET responses. RS scores were determined from pretreatment core biopsy specimens. Although half of the specimens yielded insufficient RNA, the remaining samples were highly representative. Patients with a low RS tended to respond better than those with an intermediate or high RS (n=43). Response rates by RS were similar between the tamoxifen and anastrozole groups. Patients with a low RS tended to have better relapse-free survival (RFS) than those with an intermediate or high RS (5y-RFS; 100% vs. 84% and 73%, respectively). These results suggest that RS predicts responses to NAET with tamoxifen or anastrozole. Because this pilot study examined a small sample size, these results should be validated in larger studies.",0
Weight change in women treated with adjuvant therapy or observed following mastectomy for node-positive breast cancer.,"Six hundred forty-six women with node-positive breast cancer from two prospective, randomized, adjuvant breast cancer trials were evaluated for changes in weight during and after receiving 60 weeks of chemotherapy, chemohormonal therapy, or observation. The median weight change in the 545 patients remaining on protocol at 60 weeks for observed postmenopausal patients was +1.8 kg, for treated postmenopausal patients +3.6 kg, and for treated premenopausal patients +5.9 kg (P less than .001). After a median follow-up of 6.6 years, premenopausal women who gained more than the median weight at 60 weeks had a risk of relapse 1.5 times greater (covariate P = .17) and a risk of death 1.6 times greater (covariate P = .04) than premenopausal women who had gained less than the median weight. In the postmenopausal patients, the trend for inferior relapse-free and overall survival in those who gained more than the median weight at 60 weeks was not significant (P = .05). We conclude that, relative to observation, adjuvant chemotherapy is associated with greater weight gain in node-positive, postmenopausal breast cancer patients; the amount of weight gain appears greater for premenopausal than postmenopausal women, and in premenopausal women, excessive weight gain may be associated with an increase in relapse and cancer-related deaths in the selected patients who show no evidence of recurrence during 60 weeks of adjuvant chemotherapy. This last point must be interpreted with caution because of the exploratory nature of the analyses.",0
Significantly longer progression-free survival with nab-paclitaxel compared with docetaxel as first-line therapy for metastatic breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: In patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC), nab-paclitaxel produced significantly higher antitumor activity compared with patients who received solvent-based paclitaxel. This phase II study examined the antitumor activity and safety of weekly and every 3 week (q3w) nab-paclitaxel compared with docetaxel as first-line treatment in patients with MBC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this randomized, multicenter study, patients (N = 302) with previously untreated MBC received nab-paclitaxel 300 mg/m(2) q3w, 100 mg/m(2) weekly, or 150 mg/m(2) weekly or docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) q3w.RESULTS: nab-Paclitaxel 150 mg/m(2) weekly demonstrated significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) than docetaxel by both independent radiologist assessment (12.9 v 7.5 months, respectively; P = .0065) and investigator assessment (14.6 v 7.8 months, respectively; P = .012). On the basis of independent radiologist review, both 150 mg/m(2) (49%) and 100 mg/m(2) (45%) weekly of nab-paclitaxel demonstrated a higher overall response rate (ORR) than docetaxel (35%), but this did not reach statistical significance. This trend was supported by statistically significant investigator ORR for both weekly nab-paclitaxel doses versus docetaxel. nab-Paclitaxel q3w versus docetaxel was not different for PFS or ORR. On the basis of both the independent radiologist and investigator review, disease control rate was significantly higher for patients receiving either dose of weekly nab-paclitaxel compared with docetaxel. Grade 3 or 4 fatigue, neutropenia, and febrile neutropenia were less frequent in all nab-paclitaxel arms. The frequency and grade of peripheral neuropathy were similar in all arms.CONCLUSION: This randomized study in first-line MBC demonstrated superior efficacy and safety of weekly nab-paclitaxel compared with docetaxel, with a statistically and clinically significant prolongation of PFS (> 5 months) in patients receiving nab-paclitaxel 150 mg/m(2) weekly compared with docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) q3w.",1
Trastuzumab beyond progression in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive advanced breast cancer: a german breast group 26/breast international group 03-05 study.,"PURPOSE: Trastuzumab shows clinical activity in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2)-positive early and advanced breast cancer. In the German Breast Group 26/Breast International Group 03-05 trial, we investigated if trastuzumab treatment should be continued beyond progression. METHODS: Patients with HER-2-positive breast cancer that progresses during treatment with trastuzumab were randomly assigned to receive capecitabine (2,500 mg/m(2) body-surface area on days 1 through 14 [1,250 mg/m(2) semi-daily]) alone or with continuation of trastuzumab (6 mg/kg body weight) in 3-week cycles. The primary end point was time to progression. RESULTS: We randomly assigned 78 patients to capecitabine and 78 patients to capecitabine plus trastuzumab. Sixty-five events and 38 deaths in the capecitabine group and 62 events and 33 deaths in the capecitabine-plus-trastuzumab group occurred during 15.6 months of follow-up. Median times to progression were 5.6 months in the capecitabine group and 8.2 months in the capecitabine-plus-trastuzumab group with an unadjusted hazard ratio of 0.69 (95% CI, 0.48 to 0.97; two-sided log-rank P = .0338). Overall survival rates were 20.4 months (95% CI, 17.8 to 24.7) in the capecitabine group and 25.5 months (95% CI, 19.0 to 30.7) in the capecitabine-plus-trastuzumab group (P = .257). Overall response rates were 27.0% with capecitabine and 48.1% with capecitabine plus trastuzumab (odds ratio, 2.50; P = .0115). Continuation of trastuzumab beyond progression was not associated with increased toxicity. CONCLUSION: Continuation of trastuzumab plus capecitabine showed a significant improvement in overall response and time to progression compared with capecitabine alone in women with HER-2-positive breast cancer who experienced progression during trastuzumab treatment.",1
HER-2/neu as a predictive marker in a population of advanced breast cancer patients randomly treated either with single-agent doxorubicin or single-agent docetaxel.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the predictive value of HER-2 in a population of advanced breast cancer patients randomly treated either with single-agent doxorubicin (A) or with single-agent docetaxel (T). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients from this study participated in a phase III clinical trial in which doxorubicin or docetaxel was administered for advanced disease. HER-2 was evaluated by IHC. In all positive cases, FISH was used to confirm the HER-2 positive status. The different cohorts of patients identified by HER-2 were examined to assess a possible relationship between HER-2 status and treatment effect. RESULTS: Tumor samples were available for 176 of the 326 patients entered in the clinical trial (54%). HER-2 positivity was observed in 20% of the study population. A statistically significant interaction was found between response rates to the study drugs and HER-2 status, with HER-2 positive patients deriving the highest benefit from the use of T (odds ratio for HER-2 positive patients treated with T = 3.12 (95% CI 1.11-8.80), p = 0.03). The interaction between HER-2 and response rates to A and T was also confirmed by a multivariate analysis. No statistically significant interaction was found between HER-2 and drugs efficacy evaluated in terms of time to progression and overall survival, although in the HER-2 negative cohort A was at least as effective as T in term of overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that in HER-2 positive breast cancer patients docetaxel might be more active than doxorubicin, while in HER-2 negative patients doxorubicin might be at least as effective as docetaxel. Although the present results cannot have an impact on current practice, they allow us to formulate the hypothesis that HER-2 positive breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with regard to sensitivity to anthracyclines and taxanes, and that this might be dependent upon other molecular markers including the p-53 and topoisomerase II alpha genes. This hypothesis is currently being tested prospectively in two different 'bench to bed-side' clinical trials.",0
Moderators of the effects of exercise training in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy: a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Exercise training improves supportive care outcomes in patients with breast cancer who are receiving adjuvant therapy, but the responses are heterogeneous. In this study, the authors examined personal and clinical factors that may predict exercise training responses. METHODS: Breast cancer patients who were initiating adjuvant chemotherapy (N=242) were assigned randomly to receive usual care (UC) (n=82), resistance exercise training (RET) (n=82), or aerobic exercise training (AET) (n=78) for the duration of chemotherapy. Endpoints were quality of life (QoL), aerobic fitness, muscular strength, lean body mass, and body fat. Moderators were patient preference for group assignment, marital status, age, disease stage, and chemotherapy regimen. RESULTS: Adjusted linear mixed-model analyses demonstrated that patient preference moderated QoL response (P= .005). Patients who preferred RET improved QoL when they were assigned to receive RET compared with UC (mean difference, 16.5; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 4.3-28.7; P= .008) or AET (mean difference, 11; 95% CI, -1.1-23.4; P= .076). Patients who had no preference had improved QoL when they were assigned to receive AET compared with RET (mean difference, 23; 95% CI, 4.9-41; P= .014). Marital status also moderated QoL response (P= .026), age moderated aerobic fitness response (P= .029), chemotherapy regimen moderated strength gain (P= .009), and disease stage moderated both lean body mass gain (P< .001) and fat loss (P= .059). Unmarried, younger patients who were receiving nontaxane-based therapies and had more advanced disease stage experienced better outcomes. The findings were not explained by differences in adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Patient preference, demographic variables, and medical variables moderated the effects of exercise training in breast cancer patients who were receiving chemotherapy. If replicated, these results may inform clinical practice.",0
West Midlands Oncology Association trial of adjuvant chemotherapy in node-negative breast cancer.,"Between 1976 and 1984, 574 patients with operable breast cancer and histologically negative axillary lymph nodes were randomly assigned after mastectomy to receive either no further treatment or chemotherapy with oral LMF (fluorouracil, 500 mg, methotrexate, 25 mg, and chlorambucil, 10 mg, on day 1; fluorouracil, 500 mg, and chlorambucil, 10 mg, on day 2). There is no overall survival or relapse-free survival benefit at a median follow-up of 10 years and 8 years, respectively. There are significantly more local relapses in the control group (P less than .01), but an excess of distant relapses in the treated group is not statistically significant (P = .24). A positive treatment effect in small tumors (relapse-free survival, odds ratio = 0.55, P = .01) and a negative effect in progesterone receptor-positive tumors (survival, odds ratios = 2.04, P = .04) is probably ascribable to chance. Analysis of various prognostic factors shows that tumor size and histological grade have a clear effect on both relapse-free interval and survival.",1
"Gene expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and microtubule-associated protein Tau in high-risk early breast cancer: a quest for molecular predictors of treatment benefit in the context of a Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group trial.","BACKGROUND: Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) protein expression carry weak prognostic and moderate predictive utility for the outcome of early breast cancer patients on adjuvant chemohormonotherapy. We sought to study the predictive significance and correlations of transcriptional profiling of the ER, PgR and microtubule-associated protein Tau (MAP-Tau) genes in early breast cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Messenger RNA (mRNA) was extracted from 279 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded breast carcinomas (T1-3N0-1M0) of patients enrolled in the Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group (HeCOG) trial HE 10/97, evaluating epirubicin-alkylator based adjuvant chemotherapy with or without paclitaxel (E-T-CMF versus E-CMF). Kinetic reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (kRT-PCR) was applied for assessment of the expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and MAP-Tau genes in 274 evaluable patients. Cohort-based cut-offs were defined at the 25th percentile mRNA value for ER and PgR and the median for MAP-Tau.RESULTS: Two hundred and ten patients (77%) were ER and/or PgR-positive by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Positive ER and MAP-Tau mRNA status was significantly associated with administration of hormonal therapy and low grade, while MAP-Tau mRNA status correlated with premenopausal patient status. MAP-Tau strongly correlated with ER and PgR mRNA status (Spearmann r = 0.52 and 0.64, P < 0.001). The observed chance corrected agreement between determination of hormonal receptor status by kRT-PCR and IHC was moderate (Kappa = 0.41) for ER and fair (Kappa = 0.33) for PgR. At a median follow-up of 8 years, univariate analysis adjusted for treatment showed positive ER mRNA status to be of borderline significance for reduced risk of relapse (HR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.41-1.01, P = 0.055) and death (HR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.36-1.05, P = 0.077), while positive MAP-Tau mRNA status was significantly associated with reduced risk of relapse (HR = 0.50, 95% CI 0.32-0.78, P = 0.002) and death (HR = 0.49, 95% CI 0.29-0.83, P = 0.008). In multivariate analysis, only axillary nodal metastases (HR = 2.33, 95% CI 1.05-5.16, P = 0.04) and MAP-Tau mRNA status (HR = 0.46, 95% CI 0.25-0.85, P = 0.01) independently predicted patient outcome. However, MAP-Tau mRNA levels did not predict enhanced benefit from inclusion of paclitaxel in the adjuvant chemotherapy regimen (test for interaction P = 0.99). No correlation was evident between increasing ER and PgR mRNA transcription and increasing benefit from endocrine therapy in 203 ER and/or PgR IHC-positive patients receiving adjuvant hormone therapy (Wald P = 0.54 for ER, 0.51 for PR).CONCLUSIONS: ER gene transcription carries weak predictive significance for benefit from endocrine therapy or for outcome, with no apparent dose-response association. The predictive significance is possibly exerted via MAP-Tau gene expression, an ER-inducible tubulin modulator with strong predictive significance for patient outcome. However, MAP-Tau mRNA did not predict benefit from the addition of a taxane to adjuvant chemotherapy. Further study of the biologic function and utility of MAP-Tau for individualising adjuvant therapy is warranted.",0
Approval summary for zoledronic acid for treatment of multiple myeloma and cancer bone metastases.,"PURPOSE: This article summarizes data submitted to the United States Food and Drug Administration for marketing approval of zoledronic acid (Zol; Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, NJ), a bisphosphonate drug for treating patients with bone metastases. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We review the chemistry, toxicology, pharmacology, and clinical study results submitted to support the supplemental New Drug Application for Zol for treatment of patients with bone metastases. Four- and 8-mg Zol doses were selected for Phase III trials based on bone resorption markers and clinical efficacy parameters. Patients with bone metastases were randomized in three Phase III studies (prostate cancer, solid tumors, and multiple myeloma or breast cancer) to receive 4 or 8 mg of Zol or to a control arm. The control was a placebo in the prostate cancer study and the other solid tumor study and was 90 mg of pamidronate (Pam) in the study of breast cancer and multiple myeloma. Studies were amended twice because of renal toxicity, initially to increase Zol infusion time from 5 to 15 min and later to decrease the dose in the Zol 8-mg arm to 4 mg. The efficacy end point was skeletal-related events (SREs), a composite end point consisting of pathologic fracture, radiation therapy to bone, changes in antineoplastic therapy for bone pain (prostate cancer only), surgery to bone, or spinal cord compression. This end point was analyzed either as the proportion of patients with SRE or time to first SRE. The breast cancer and myeloma study used a noninferiority statistical analysis methods to determine efficacy. RESULTS: In prostate cancer, both the proportions analysis and time-to-SRE analysis showed significantly less bone morbidity on Zol (4 mg) than placebo, but no significant difference between Zol (8 mg) and placebo in either analysis. In the solid tumor study, the time to SRE analysis but not the proportions analysis showed significantly less skeletal morbidity on Zol (4 mg) than placebo, and Zol (8 mg) was significantly better than placebo in both analyses. The breast cancer and myeloma study demonstrated noninferiority of Zol compared with Pam, with Zol retaining at least 49.3% of the Pam treatment effect previously demonstrated in placebo-controlled trials. Zol was approved on February 22, 2002, by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the ""treatment of patients with multiple myeloma and documented bone metastases from solid tumors, in conjunction with standard antineoplastic therapy. Prostate cancer should have progressed after treatment with at least one hormonal therapy."" The recommended dose and schedule is 4 mg of Zol infused over 15 min every 3-4 weeks. Increased Zol doses and shorter infusions are not recommended because of potential renal toxicity.",0
Impact of body mass index on the efficacy of endocrine therapy in premenopausal patients with breast cancer: an analysis of the prospective ABCSG-12 trial.,"PURPOSE: Aromatase inhibitors are effective as endocrine treatment for patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. According to the hypothesis that overweight patients have higher levels of aromatase enzyme availability, we investigated the influence of body mass index (BMI) on the efficacy of adjuvant endocrine therapy in premenopausal patients in a retrospective analysis of the Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group (ABCSG) 12 trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: ABCSG-12 examined the efficacy of ovarian suppression using goserelin (3.6 mg subcutaneously every 28 days) in combination with anastrozole or tamoxifen with or without zoledronic acid (4 mg intravenously every 6 months) in premenopausal women with endocrine-responsive breast cancer. BMI was calculated using the prospectively collected data on patients' height and weight at study entry. BMI categories have been differentiated according to the WHO definition. RESULTS: Overweight patients treated with anastrozole had a 60% increase in the risk of disease recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 1.60; 95% CI, 1.06 to 2.41; P = .02) and more than a doubling in the risk of death (HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.17 to 3.92; P = .01) compared with normal weight patients treated with anastrozole. In the overweight group, patients treated with anastrozole had a nearly 50% increase in the risk of disease recurrence (HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 0.93 to 2.38; P = .08) and a three-fold increase in the risk of death (HR, 3.03; 95% CI, 1.35 to 6.82; P = .004) compared with patients treated with tamoxifen. CONCLUSION: BMI significantly impacts on the efficacy of anastrozole plus goserelin in premenopausal patients with breast cancer, probably through influencing aromatase availability and/or ovarian suppression by goserelin.",0

Endocrine response after prior treatment with fulvestrant in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer: experience from a single centre.,"The pure anti-oestrogen fulvestrant has now been licensed for use in advanced breast cancer which has progressed on an anti-oestrogen. Optimal sequencing of various endocrine agents becomes very important in the therapeutic strategy. We report our experience of further endocrine response with another endocrine agent after prior fulvestrant treatment. Among all patients with advanced breast cancer who had been entered into five phase II/III trials using fulvestrant as first- to ninth-line endocrine therapy in our Unit since 1993, 54 patients who fulfilled the following criteria were studied for their subsequent endocrine response: (i) oestrogen receptor positive or unknown; (ii) having been on a subsequent endocrine therapy for > or =6 months unless the disease progressed before; and (iii) with disease assessable for response according to International Union Against Cancer criteria. Eleven patients had received an aromatase inhibitor prior to fulvestrant, which resulted in five CBs (clinical benefit = objective remission/stable disease (SD)) for > or =6 months). Twenty-eight patients achieved CB on fulvestrant. They went on subsequent endocrine therapy with two partial responses, 11 SDs and 15 PDs (progressive disease) at 6 months. The median survival from starting fulvestrant and subsequent endocrine therapy was respectively 46.6 and 18.2 months. Among the remaining 26 patients who progressed at 6 months on fulvestrant, there were three SDs and 23 PDs at 6 months on subsequent endocrine therapy. The median survival from starting fulvestrant and subsequent endocrine therapy was respectively 12.5 and 9.3 months. Of all these 54 patients, 30% (n = 16) therefore achieved CB using another (second- to tenth-line) endocrine agent (anastrozole = 26; tamoxifen = 12; megestrol acetate = 11; others = 5). It would thus appear that further endocrine response can be induced in a reasonable proportion of patients after failing fulvestrant.",0
CLEOPATRA: a phase III evaluation of pertuzumab and trastuzumab for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.,"INTRODUCTION: Patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer have a poor prognosis. Despite proven efficacy with the standard of care, trastuzumab, most patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) will eventually progress, requiring further intervention to prolong life. Pertuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, is the first HER2 dimerization inhibitor. It binds to the dimerization site on the HER2 domain and prevents ligand-driven pairing of HER2 with other HER receptors, thus inhibiting tumor cell growth and survival. Combining trastuzumab and pertuzumab therefore provides a more comprehensive blockade of the HER signaling pathways, resulting in greater antitumor efficacy. STUDY DESIGN: CLEOPATRA (CLinical Evaluation Of Pertuzumab And TRAstuzumab) is an international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial that aims to recruit approximately 800 patients from around 250 centers worldwide. Adults with HER2-positive adenocarcinoma of the breast with locally recurrent or metastatic disease will be randomized (1:1) to receive docetaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab or docetaxel, trastuzumab, and placebo. The primary endpoint of the study is progression-free survival (PFS), based on tumor assessments conducted by an independent review facility. Secondary endpoints include PFS evaluated by investigator assessment, overall survival, objective response rate, duration of response, time to symptom progression, and safety. Data will also be collected to identify biomarkers that may correlate with clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION: The CLEOPATRA study will provide important information about the efficacy and safety of adding pertuzumab to one current standard of care in patients with HER2-positive MBC.",0
Trastuzumab beyond progression: overall survival analysis of the GBG 26/BIG 3-05 phase III study in HER2-positive breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Continuation of trastuzumab plus capecitabine (XH) showed a significantly improved overall response rate and time to progression compared with capecitabine (X) alone in women with HER2-positive breast cancer progressing during trastuzumab treatment. Here, we report the final analysis on overall survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with HER2-positive, advanced breast cancer who progressed during treatment with trastuzumab with or without 1st-line metastatic chemotherapy were prospectively randomised to X (2500mg/m(2) on days 1-14, q3w) or XH (6 (8)mg/kg, q3w). Overall survival was a pre-specified secondary end-point. RESULTS: Median follow-up at June 2010 was 20.7months. Fifty nine of 74 and 60 of 77 patients died in the X and XH arm, respectively. Median overall survival was 20.6 and 24.9months with X and XH, respectively (HR=0.94 [0.65-1.35]; p=0.73). Performance status and metastatic site were independent prognosticators for overall survival. No difference between treatment arms was observed for patients who achieved clinical response or clinical benefit, respectively. Patients who continued/restarted anti-HER2 treatment (trastuzumab or lapatinib) after 2nd progression (N=52) had a post-progression survival of 18.8 compared with 13.3months for those who did not receive 3rd line treatment with anti-HER2 agents (N=88) (HR 0.63; p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Final overall survival analysis of the GBG-26 study did not demonstrate a significant survival benefit for treatment beyond progression with trastuzumab. However, in a post-hoc analysis, patients receiving anti-HER2 treatment as 3rd line therapy showed a better post-progression survival than those not receiving this targeted treatment.",1
Changes in the circulating plasma levels of VEGF and VEGF-D after adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer and 1 to 3 positive lymph nodes.,"BACKGROUND: The goal of the present study was to investigate the changes in concentration of the important lymph-angiogenesis factors vascular endothelium-derived growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF-D under adjuvant chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The blood plasma of a total of 142 patients with breast carcinoma and with 1 to 3 affected lymph nodes was investigated, using the quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique, prior to and following chemotherapy, within the framework of a randomized phase III study: the patients received either conventional or dose-intensified chemotherapy. RESULTS: In general, there was a significant reduction in VEGF levels after chemotherapy only in patients with large tumors (T3) (p = 0.043). There was also an almost significant reduction in patients with an overexpression of c-erbB-2 (Dako Score +3, p = 0.052). In contrast, the clearest reduction in VEGF-D occurred in patients with a positive hormone receptor status (p = 0.04) or in patients with a low expression of c-erbB-2 (Dako Score +1, p = 0.05). A significant effect of chemotherapy on VEGF-D was determined only in patients who had a baseline level that was above the normal (conventionel treatment p = 0.005; dose-intensified treatment p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: Both VEGF and VEGF-D levels changed after chemotherapy, depending on the patient and tumor characteristics. With respect to changes in the plasma levels of VEGF and VEGF-D, there were no significant differences between dose-intensified and conventional chemotherapy.",0
Randomized trial of radiotherapy versus radiotherapy plus metronidazole for the treatment metastatic cancer to brain. A Southwest Oncology Group study.,"One hundred sixteen eligible patients with metastatic cancer to the brain were randomized to receive either radiotherapy 3000 rad/10 fractions (treatment 1) or the same radiotherapy plus metronidazole 6 gm/m2 (treatment 2). One hundred eleven patients were either fully or partially evaluable. The response rates (CR + PR) and survival showed no significant differences between treatments. Treatment 1: CR + PR 24%, median survival 14 weeks, Treatment 2: CR + PR 27%, median survival 12 weeks. There were no differences observed in response rates based on primary tumor site, neurologic performance status, or extent of metastatic disease. Metronidazole therapy was associated with substantial nausea and vomiting but no neurotoxicity was observed. Oral metronidazole given every other day during radiation therapy provided no clinical benefit for patients with brain metastases compared to radiotherapy alone.",0
An acute toxicity study on the effects of synchronous chemotherapy and radiotherapy in early stage breast cancer after conservative surgery.,"One hundred and ninety-seven patients with early stage breast cancer, who were treated initially with conservative surgery, were evaluated prospectively for acute toxicity after completing post-operative irradiation. Eighty-seven of these patients had synchronous chemotherapy with the 3M regimen (mitoxantrone, methotrexate and Mitomycin-C) during radiotherapy. The results indicate that patients receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy (CRT) showed no significant difference in acute skin toxicity (AST) when compared with those treated with radiotherapy alone (RTO), with an odds ratio (OR = 0.6) and 95% confidence intervals (0.3-1.1) of developing either a moderate or severe, compared with a mild, skin reaction. Even after controlling for other confounding factors, such as treatment technique and beam energy, patients treated with the supine technique using 6-10 MV photons still displayed no significant difference in AST, with 12/74 (16%) patients in the CRT group and 14/66 (21%) in the RTO group developing a moderate or severe skin reaction (OR = 0.7 (95% CI 0.3-1.7)). Four of the 87 patients treated with CRT developed symptomatic acute radiation pneumonitis, three of whom were found to have > 3 cm of lung length on their simulator or check films. The volume of lung included within the treatment field was found to be statistically significant (P = 0.005) in predicting the onset of radiation pneumonitis in the CRT group. None of these patients has suffered any symptomatic late lung toxicity. We conclude that synchronous chemotherapy and radiotherapy, when using the 3M regimen, is feasible for patients having adjuvant treatment for early stage breast carcinoma and there is no significant increase in AST. However, it is associated with an increase in acute radiation pneumonitis when a significant volume of lung is included within the radiation treatment field.",0
The ATAC trial: the vanguard trial for use of aromatase inhibitors in early breast cancer.,"The Anastrozole, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination (ATAC) trial was the first trial to explore the use of aromatase inhibitors in post-menopausal women with early breast cancer and is the largest published cancer treatment trial in breast cancer. The main results have been published at 33-, 47- and 68-month median follow-up, and further analyses are planned for the end of 2007 and in 2010. This trial demonstrated that 5 years of treatment with anastrozole was generally better tolerated than 5 years of treatment with tamoxifen, and led to lower recurrence rates, especially in receptor-positive women (26% reduction). The side-effect profile was different than that for tamoxifen, with fewer hot flushes, gynecologic symptoms, endometrial cancers, strokes and thromboembolic events; however, an increased incidence of fractures, joint symptoms and carpal tunnel syndrome was observed. Future analyses will determine whether benefits and fracture rates persist after stopping treatment, and the extent to which currently marginal benefits on late end points, such as distant recurrence and death after recurrence, are sustained or improved.",0
Sentinel node biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer: results from National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project Protocol B-27.,"PURPOSE: Experience with sentinel node biopsy (SNB) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is limited. We examined the feasibility and accuracy of this procedure within a randomized trial in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: During the conduct of National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project trial B-27, several participating surgeons attempted SNB before the required axillary dissection in 428 patients. All underwent lymphatic mapping and an attempt to identify and remove a sentinel node. Lymphatic mapping was performed with radioactive colloid (14.7%), with lymphazurin blue dye alone (29.9%), or with both (54.7%). RESULTS: Success rate for the identification and removal of a sentinel node was 84.8%. Success rate increased significantly with the use of radioisotope (87.6% to 88.9%) versus with the use of lymphazurin alone (78.1%, P = .03). There were no significant differences in success rate according to clinical tumor size, clinical nodal status, age, or calendar year of random assignment. Of 343 patients who had SNB and axillary dissection, the sentinel nodes were positive in 125 patients and were the only positive nodes in 70 patients (56.0%). Of the 218 patients with negative sentinel nodes, nonsentinel nodes were positive in 15 (false-negative rate, 10.7%; 15 of 140 patients). There were no significant differences in false-negative rate according to clinical patient and tumor characteristics, method of lymphatic mapping, or breast tumor response to chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: These results are comparable to those obtained from multicenter studies evaluating SNB before systemic therapy and suggest that the sentinel node concept is applicable following neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",0
"Monitoring the response of large (>3 cm) and locally advanced (T3-4, N0-2) breast cancer to neoadjuvant chemotherapy using (99m)Tc-Sestamibi uptake.","BACKGROUND AND AIM: (99m)Tc-Sestamibi (MIBI) scintimammography has an established role in the diagnosis of breast cancer. As a functional imaging technique, it may also be useful in assessing the response to chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of the technique for this purpose. METHODS: Twenty-six patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for large or locally advanced breast cancer were monitored using the tumour to background ratio measured on MIBI scintimammograms. Patients were assessed and the size of the tumour was measured by callipers and ultrasonography before and at the end of treatment. Patients were assessed as complete, partial or non-responders. Following chemotherapy, patients proceeded to surgery with pathological evaluation of the operative specimen. RESULTS: Twenty-four of the 26 patients showed a reduction in MIBI uptake on completion of chemotherapy. Residual tumour was demonstrated on the scintimammogram in four patients and all had significant residual disease on histology. In the remaining 22 patients, the final scintimammogram was negative, although three patients were assessed as non-responders and had large residual tumours on histology. CONCLUSION: A positive MIBI scan is highly predictive of the presence of significant residual disease on completion of chemotherapy. However, a negative MIBI scan does not rule out the presence of considerable residual tumour. Whereas ultrasound and clinical assessment may underestimate the response to chemotherapy, MIBI imaging tends to overestimate the response.",0
"Natural history of more than 20 years of node-positive primary breast carcinoma treated with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy: a study by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B.","PURPOSE: Breast cancer heterogeneity dictates lengthy follow-up to assess outcomes. Efficacy differences for three regimens that are based on adjuvant cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) are presented in this article, but cancer recurrence sites, time of relapse, subsequent primary cancers, and causes of death in the natural history of node-positive breast cancer are emphasized. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Beginning in 1975, 905 patients with node-positive cancer were randomly assigned to receive CMF or two regimens of CMF plus other agents. Median follow-up is 22.6 years. The natural-history analysis was performed on a subset of 814 patients. RESULTS: Eighty percent of the 599 women known to have died, died of metastatic breast cancer. Only 8.5% of the deceased women died of a cause other than breast cancer, a second or third cancer, or adjuvant chemotherapy toxicity. One hundred five women (12.8%) developed other primary cancers, with 49 (46.6%) occurring in the contralateral breast. Therapeutic efficacy differences of the CMF regimens reported earlier have been maintained more than 20 years later. For certain subsets, the five-drug regimen had advantages over CMF. Bone was the most common recurrence site. The longest interval to relapse has been 23.5 years, and 18% of those who relapsed did so more than 10 years later. CONCLUSION: Despite adjuvant chemotherapy, a large majority (80%) of women with node-positive breast cancer die of the disease, and many recurrences develop more than 10 years later. CMF plus vincristine and prednisone provides a benefit compared with CMF, but the magnitude varies with the number of involved nodes. Outcome trends in earlier analyses of this study were maintained even years later.",0
Regional and seasonal influence in patient's toxicity to adjuvant chemotherapy for early breast cancer.,"Results from multinational clinical trials are globally adopted into the routine clinical practice in most countries. Changes in the natural history and incidence of certain diseases as well as in drugs toxicities related to yearly seasons have been reported, however, variations related to climate have never been described. In our study, we assessed whether yearly seasons and climate could influence the chemotherapy toxicity profile. We analyzed the toxicities recorded in the phase III GEICAM 9906 study which was run in different geographically and climatically/seasonally regions in Spain. In this trial 1246 patients were randomized and eligible to receive FEC90 ×6 cycles or FEC90 ×4 cycles followed by eight doses of weekly paclitaxel (T). The results showed differences in hematological and non-hematological toxicities in relation to the season of the year and the climate of the area in which the treatment was administered. We found a higher hematological toxicity in warm seasons (spring and summer) and in Oceanic climate regions (Neutropenia G4: 7.8 vs. 1.0 vs. 1.0%, P < 0.0001). Asthenia was greater frequency in the summer period (FEC90: 21.1%, T: 15.3%) as well as in the Mediterranean areas (FEC: 28% T: 27.2%). Also we observed liver transaminase elevations were more frequent in the summer and in the Oceanic areas. Myalgias and secondary sensory neuropathy to paclitaxel were recorded more frequently during autumn. Climate should be considered a significant variable in toxicity to chemotherapy.",0
"The effect of tibolone in postmenopausal women receiving tamoxifen after surgery for breast cancer: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.","OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of tibolone on climacteric symptoms, endometrium and serum lipid/lipoproteins in postmenopausal women receiving tamoxifen after surgery for breast cancer. DESIGN: Double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre pilot study. SETTING: Hospital outpatient clinic. SAMPLE: Seventy postmenopausal women receiving tamoxifen following surgery for early breast cancer. METHODS: Women received 20 mg/day oral tamoxifen plus either 2.5 mg/day oral tibolone or placebo for 12 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency and severity of hot flushes (diary cards); intensity of hot flushes and sweats (Landgren scale); interference of hot flushes and sweats with normal life; frequency and intensity of other climacteric symptoms; endometrial thickness and histology; vaginal bleeding; breast cancer recurrence and serum lipid/lipoproteins. RESULTS: Daily card data showed no change in the daily number of hot flushes with either tibolone or placebo (P= 0.219) after three months. There was a significant reduction in the severity of flushes with tibolone compared with placebo (-0.4 vs 0.2, P= 0.031). The Landgren scale showed a mean change in the number of hot flushes of -0.6 with tibolone and +1.1 with placebo after 12 months (P= 0.022). Endometrial biopsies were normal and vaginal bleeding was similar in both groups. A significant decrease in triglycerides (-23% vs 1.4%) and HDL (-12% vs 19%) was seen with tibolone compared with placebo after 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Tibolone prevented an increase in hot flushes in postmenopausal women given tamoxifen following surgery for breast cancer without untoward effects on the endometrium. Beneficial effects on serum lipid profile were noted.",1
Fitting new modalities into practice guidelines.,"At M. D. Anderson, the use of the recently approved bisphosphonate pamidronate (Aredia) became a part of the standard of care pathway for the treatment of osteolytic metastases from breast cancer. How any agent achieves that status involves the long process of completing clinical trials and resolving many practical and ethical dilemmas. What criteria determine the standard of care and who decides what those criteria should be are two of the many questions that need to be answered before a treatment modality or specific agent becomes part of the standard of care. This article describes how pamidronate achieved that status at M. D. Anderson.",0
Comparative study of dose escalation versus interval reduction to obtain dose-intensification of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in advanced breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: A potential application of hematopoietic growth factors is to obtain an increased dose-intensity. This can be achieved by either higher doses of chemotherapy with standard intervals, or by standard doses with shorter intervals. The potential of these approaches has not been investigated systematically. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a randomized, multicenter study, 49 advanced breast cancer patients were treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and either increasing doses of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide with fixed intervals (arm one) or progressively shorter intervals with fixed doses of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (arm two). A cohort of at least six patients was studied at each interval/dose. A more intensified interval/dose was given if less than 50% of patients encountered a dose-intensity limiting criterium (DILC) in the first three courses. RESULTS: In arm one, epirubicin 140 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 800 mg/m2 every 21 days was too toxic. Subsequently, epirubicin 120 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 700 mg/m2 was tested with two of 10 patients encountering a DILC. All initial DILCs consisted of febrile neutropenia. In arm two, epirubicin 75 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 could be administered safely with 14- and 12-day intervals. In the 10-day interval, eight of 12 patients completed the first three cycles without a DILC. In the 8-day interval, seven of eight patients encountered a DILC. Incomplete neutrophil recovery, and to a lesser extent stomatitis, were dose-limiting. CONCLUSION: In combination with G-CSF, epirubicin 120 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 700 mg/m2 every 21 days was feasible (projected dose-intensity, 40 mg/m2/wk and 233 mg/m2/wk, respectively). Epirubicin 75 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 could be administered safely every 10 days, allowing a projected dose-intensity of 52.5 mg/m2/wk and 350 mg/m2/wk, respectively.",1
Effects of stellate-ganglion block on hot flushes and night awakenings in survivors of breast cancer: a pilot study.,"BACKGROUND: Debilitating hot flushes and sleep dysfunction often affect survivors of breast cancer, most notably in those taking anti-oestrogen medications. Conventional treatments have been only partially effective in diminishing these issues, and some have serious risks. We did a pilot study to investigate our hypothesis that stellate-ganglion block can be a safe and effective treatment for hot flushes and sleep dysfunction in this patient population. METHODS: 13 survivors of breast cancer (in remission) with severe hot flushes and night awakenings were treated with stellate-ganglion block at the anterolateral aspect of the C6 vertebra on the right side under fluoroscopy. Patients recorded hot flushes in a daily diary by use of the Hot-Flash Score, devised by Sloan and colleagues, and night awakenings by use of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Both instruments were used 1 week before the procedure [A40] and then weekly after the procedure for 12 weeks. We used the generalised-estimating-equations method to analyse the longitudinal measurements of the number of hot flushes and night awakenings over time. This method is a popular approach to analysing datasets that have repeated measures from the same person, and is robust because it does not need the complete distribution of the outcomes to be specified. This trial is registered on the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number register (ISRCTN14318565). FINDINGS: There were no adverse events resulting from the stellate-ganglion block, although patients had temporary Horner's syndrome indicating the effectiveness of the block. Five patients had only one stellate-ganglion block and eight had two stellate-ganglion blocks. The total number of hot flushes decreased from a mean of 79.4 (SD 37.4) per week before the procedure to a mean of 49.9 (SD 39.9) per week during the first 2 weeks after the procedure (p=0.0002). The total number of hot flushes continued to decrease over the remaining follow-up period (weeks 3-12), and stabilised at a mean of 8.1 (SD 5.6) per week (p<0.0001). The number of very severe hot flushes was decreased to near zero by the end of the follow-up period (week 12; p<0.0001). Night awakenings decreased from a mean of 19.5 (SD 14.8) per week before the procedure to a mean of 7.3 (SD 7.1) per week during the first 2 weeks after the procedure (p<0.0001). The total number of night awakenings continued to decrease over the remaining follow-up period (weeks 3-12) and stabilised at a mean of 1.4 (SD 1.2) per week (p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION: The findings of this study suggest that stellate-ganglion block can provide survivors of breast cancer with relief from hot flushes and sleep dysfunction with few or no side-effects. Long-term relief of symptoms has the potential to improve overall quality of life and increase compliance with anti-oestrogen medications for breast cancer.",0
Efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy in high-risk node-negative breast cancer. An intergroup study.,"We randomly assigned 536 women who had undergone either a modified radical mastectomy or a total mastectomy with low axillary-node dissection for potentially curable breast carcinoma to receive adjuvant chemotherapy or no-treatment observation. The patients were considered at high risk for recurrence because they had either an estrogen-receptor-negative tumor of any size or an estrogen-receptor-positive tumor at least 3 cm in diameter with no histopathological evidence of axillary-node involvement. The chemotherapy consisted of six four-week cycles of cyclophosphamide (100 mg per square meter of body-surface area orally on days 1 through 14), methotrexate (40 mg per square meter intravenously on days 1 and 8), fluorouracil (600 mg per square meter intravenously on days 1 and 8), and prednisone (40 mg per square meter orally on days 1 through 14). Treatments were balanced with respect to patients' characteristics. The analysis included 406 eligible patients who were entered in the study before October 1, 1987. The overall disease-free survival among patients treated with the four-drug regimen was 84 percent, as compared with 69 percent for the control group, at a median follow-up of three years (P = 0.0001). A treatment benefit was also observed in premenopausal and postmenopausal patients as well as in patients with estrogen-receptor-positive or with estrogen-receptor-negative tumors. Severe or life-threatening hematologic toxicity was encountered in 33 percent of the treated patients, with one death. Our results indicate that adjuvant chemotherapy with six cycles of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil, and prednisone is effective in improving three-year disease-free survival among high-risk patients with axillary-node-negative, operable breast cancer. An analysis of the effect of treatment on survival awaits a longer follow-up.",1
"Patterns of tumor relapse following mastectomy and adjuvant systemic therapy in patients with axillary lymph node-positive breast cancer. Impact of clinical, histopathologic, and flow cytometric factors.","BACKGROUND: This analysis was conducted to evaluate the impact of selected clinical, histopathologic, and flow cytometric factors on sites of initial tumor relapse after postmastectomy adjuvant systemic therapy. METHODS: Five hundred sixty-four patients with axillary node-positive breast cancer were entered in two prospectively randomized trials and received cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil and prednisone with or without tamoxifen as sole adjuvant therapy. These patients were studied to assess the risk of locoregional recurrence and to identify factors that might predict tumor relapse site. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 9.3 years, the 8-year cumulative incidences of initial locoregional or distant relapse were 20% and 35%, respectively. Pathologic tumor stage, estrogen receptor content, and number of involved axillary nodes were independent predictive factors for an increased risk of locoregional recurrence. With the exception of tumor stage, these factors also were associated with an increased risk of distant relapse so that tumor stage (T3a) remained the sole factor predictive of increased relative risk for initial locoregional (versus distant) recurrence in patients with tumor progression. Clinical and flow cytometric factors were not predictive of initial locoregional or distant relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Exploratory data analysis of two prospective trials of postmastectomy adjuvant systemic therapy has demonstrated a significant risk for initial isolated locoregional recurrence in certain patients with node-positive breast cancer. The benefit of improved locoregional tumor control in appropriately selected patients with axillary node-positive breast cancer who receive adjuvant systemic therapy requires additional investigation.",0
Predicting early failure after adjuvant chemotherapy in high-risk breast cancer patients with extensive lymph node involvement.,"PURPOSE: There is limited knowledge of risk factors for breast cancer recurrence within 2 years. This study aimed to predict early failure and identify high-risk patients for prognostic and therapeutic purposes. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We studied 739 patients from a randomized trial who were <56 years of age and had >/=4 or more positive lymph nodes, no distant metastases, and no previous other malignancies. After complete surgical treatment, patients received conventional-dose anthracycline-based chemotherapy or a high-dose scheme of anthracycline-based plus alkylating chemotherapy. We assessed clinical and (immuno)histological parameters to predict recurrence within 2 years. RESULTS: Early failure occurred in 19% (n = 137). Median survival after early failure was limited to 0.7 year. Estrogen and progesterone receptor negativity and visceral relapse predicted poor prognosis. Early failure was associated with young age, large tumors, high histological grade, angio-invasion, apical node metastasis, and >/=10 involved nodes. Estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and p27 negativity; HER2 overexpression; and p53 positivity also predicted early failure. The surgical or chemotherapy regimen and histological type did not. The same parameters except tumor size were associated with early death. Grade III, >/=10 involved nodes, and estrogen receptor negativity were independently associated with early failure and together identified a subset of patients (7%) with 3-fold increased early failure and 5-fold increased early death. CONCLUSIONS: Early failure is associated with poor survival. The combination of three commonly determined parameters constitutes a strong predictive model for early failure and death.",0
Long-term outcomes of invasive ipsilateral breast tumor recurrences after lumpectomy in NSABP B-17 and B-24 randomized clinical trials for DCIS.,"BACKGROUND: Ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) is the most common failure event after lumpectomy for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). We evaluated invasive IBTR (I-IBTR) and its influence on survival among participants in two National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) randomized trials for DCIS.METHODS: In the NSABP B-17 trial (accrual period: October 1, 1985, to December 31, 1990), patients with localized DCIS were randomly assigned to the lumpectomy only (LO, n = 403) group or to the lumpectomy followed by radiotherapy (LRT, n = 410) group. In the NSABP B-24 double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial (accrual period: May 9, 1991, to April 13, 1994), all accrued patients were randomly assigned to LRT+ placebo, (n=900) or LRT + tamoxifen (LRT + TAM, n = 899). Endpoints included I-IBTR, DCIS-IBTR, contralateral breast cancers (CBC), overall and breast cancer-specific survival, and survival after I-IBTR. Median follow-up was 207 months for the B-17 trial (N = 813 patients) and 163 months for the B-24 trial (N = 1799 patients).RESULTS: Of 490 IBTR events, 263 (53.7%) were invasive. Radiation reduced I-IBTR by 52% in the LRT group compared with LO (B-17, hazard ratio [HR] of risk of I-IBTR = 0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.33 to 0.69, P < .001). LRT + TAM reduced I-IBTR by 32% compared with LRT + placebo (B-24, HR of risk of I-IBTR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.49 to 0.95, P = .025). The 15-year cumulative incidence of I-IBTR was 19.4% for LO, 8.9% for LRT (B-17), 10.0% for LRT + placebo (B-24), and 8.5% for LRT + TAM. The 15-year cumulative incidence of all contralateral breast cancers was 10.3% for LO, 10.2% for LRT (B-17), 10.8% for LRT + placebo (B-24), and 7.3% for LRT + TAM. I-IBTR was associated with increased mortality risk (HR of death = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.45 to 2.96, P < .001), whereas recurrence of DCIS was not. Twenty-two of 39 deaths after I-IBTR were attributed to breast cancer. Among all patients (with or without I-IBTR), the 15-year cumulative incidence of breast cancer death was 3.1% for LO, 4.7% for LRT (B-17), 2.7% for LRT + placebo (B-24), and 2.3% for LRT + TAM.CONCLUSIONS: Although I-IBTR increased the risk for breast cancer-related death, radiation therapy and tamoxifen reduced I-IBTR, and long-term prognosis remained excellent after breast-conserving surgery for DCIS.",0
Y-box-binding protein YB-1 identifies high-risk patients with primary breast cancer benefiting from rapidly cycled tandem high-dose adjuvant chemotherapy.,"PURPOSE: To investigate the potential of Y-box-binding protein YB-1, a multifunctional protein linked to tumor aggressiveness and multidrug resistance, to identify patients with breast cancer likely to benefit from dose-intensified chemotherapy regimens. PATIENTS AND METHODS: YB-1 was immunohistochemically determined in 211 primary tumors from the prospective, randomized West German Study Group WSG-AM-01 trial in high-risk (> or = 10 involved lymph-nodes) breast cancer (HRBC). Predictive impact of YB-1 was assessed by multivariate survival analysis, including time-varying factor-therapy interactions. RESULTS: At median follow-up of 61.7 months, patients receiving rapidly cycled tandem high-dose therapy (HD; two cycles [2x] epirubicin 90 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) every 14 days, followed by 2x epirubicin 90 mg/m(2), cyclophosphamide 3,000 mg/m(2), and thiotepa 400 mg/m(2) every 21 days) had better disease-free survival (DFS; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.62; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.89) and overall survival (OS; HR = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.4 to 0.89) than those receiving conventional dose-dense chemotherapy (DD; 4x epirubicin 90 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2), followed by 3x cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2), methotrexate 40 mg/m(2), and fluorouracil 600 mg/m(2) every 14 days). High YB-1 was associated with aggressive tumor phenotype (negative steroid hormone receptor status, positive human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 and p53 status, high MIB-1, unfavorable tumor grade) and poor OS (median 78 v 97 months; P = .01). In patients with high YB-1, HD yielded a 63-month median DFS (P = .001) and a 46-month median OS advantage (P = .002) versus DD. In multivariate models, patients with high B-1 receiving HD (v DD) had one third the hazard rate after 20 months for DFS and one sixth after 40 months for OS. CONCLUSION: In a randomized prospective cancer therapy trial, for the first time, a strong predictive impact of YB-1 on survival has been demonstrated: enhanced benefit from HD (v DD) therapy occurs in HRBC with high YB-1. Future trials could therefore address optimal chemotherapeutic strategies,taking YB-1 into account.",0
Doxorubicin-paclitaxel: a safe regimen in terms of cardiac toxicity in metastatic breast carcinoma patients. Results from a European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer multicenter trial.,"BACKGROUND: The potential cardiotoxicity of the doxorubicin-paclitaxel regimen, when paclitaxel is given shortly after the end of the anthracycline infusion, is an issue of concern, as suggested by small single institution Phase II studies. METHODS: In a large multicenter Phase III trial, 275 anthracycline naive metastatic breast carcinoma patients were randomized to receive either doxorubicin (60 mg/m(2)) followed 30 minutes later by paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2) 3-hour infusion; AT) or a standard doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide regimen (AC; 60/600 mg/m(2)). Both treatments were given once every 3 weeks for a maximum of six cycles. Close cardiac monitoring was implemented in the study design. RESULTS: Congestive heart failure (CHF) occurred in three patients in the AT arm and in one patient in the AC arm (P = 0.62). Decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction to below the limit of normal were documented in 33% AT and 19% AC patients and were not predictive of CHF development. CONCLUSIONS: AT is devoid of excessive cardiac risk among metastatic breast carcinoma patients, when the maximum planned cumulative dose of doxorubicin does not exceed 360 mg/m(2).",0
"Endometrial changes with tamoxifen: comparison between tamoxifen-treated and nontreated asymptomatic, postmenopausal breast cancer patients.","Endometrial thickness, as evaluated by vaginal ultrasonography, and endometrial histologic findings, as well as demographic characteristics, health habits, and risk factors for endometrial cancer, were compared between 93 asymptomatic postmenopausal breast cancer patients who had been on tamoxifen treatment and 20 patients who had not. The mean ultrasonographic endometrial thickness in the women on tamoxifen treatment was 13.1 +/- 10.4 mm, which was significantly thicker than the 4.0 +/- 3.2 mm found in the nontreated women (P = 0.001). The frequency of endometrial pathological findings was remarkably high (35.5%) among the tamoxifen-treated patients, compared with nontreated patients (20.0%), with a P value of 0.058 and an odd ratio of 4.6. Thus, it is suggested that the remarkably high prevalence of pathological endometrial changes was due to the continuous and unopposed exposure of the endometrium to tamoxifen.",0
"Adjuvant cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil versus fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy in premenopausal women with axillary node-positive operable breast cancer: results of a randomized trial. The International Collaborative Cancer Group.","PURPOSE: To determine whether a combination chemotherapy regimen that contains epirubicin (fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide [FEC]) is superior to the standard cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) combination in premenopausal women with axillary node-positive operable breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The International Collaborative Cancer Group (ICCG) conducted a large randomized trial in which two alternative schedules were used according to participating center: CMF1 versus FEC1 and CMF2 versus FEC2. RESULTS: Seven hundred fifty-nine patients were entered onto the trial. At a median follow-up time of 4.5 years, no significant benefit for the anthracycline-containing regimen was observed in terms of relapse-free (P = .61) or overall survival (P = .13). FEC1 and CMF1 appear to be of similar efficacy, but there is a suggestion that FEC2 may be superior to CMF2, since patients who received FEC2 had improved overall (P = .02) and relapse-free survival (P = .03) rates. Nausea and vomiting and alopecia were more common in the epirubicin-containing regimen (P = .001). CONCLUSION: We conclude that the FEC2 regimen, in which epirubicin replaced the methotrexate in CMF, is the preferable adjuvant chemotherapy regimen for premenopausal patients with operable axillary node-positive breast cancer.",1

Comparison of EQ-5D scores among anthracycline-containing regimens followed by taxane and taxane-only regimens for node-positive breast cancer patients after surgery: the N-SAS BC 02 trial.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine health-related quality of life, we investigated the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy regimens on utility scores assessed by the EuroQoL-5D (EQ-5D) instrument in a randomized, controlled trial for breast cancer patients after surgery. We also investigated the relationship between Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) scale scores and EQ-5D utilities. METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to the following four chemotherapy regimens: four cycles of anthracycline followed by paclitaxel (ACP), four cycles of anthracycline-containing regimens followed by docetaxel (ACD), eight cycles of paclitaxel (PTX), and eight cycles of docetaxel (DTX). Of 1060 registered, the first 300 consecutive patients were included in the current utility study. Utility scores were assessed using the EQ-5D instrument at baseline; cycles 3, 5, and 7; 7 months; and 1 year. We also evaluated the correlation between these scores and FACT-G, -B, and -Taxane scores at each time point. RESULTS: Utility scores were significantly lower in the DTX group than in the ACP and ACD groups. Mean utility scores in the DTX group were lowest at 7 months and tended to remain low for a long time. The combined anthracycline followed by taxane group had significantly higher utility scores that the taxane-alone group, with no significant difference depending on the type of taxane. Only the FACT-G social/family well-being subscale had no relationship with EQ-5D responses and utility scores. CONCLUSIONS: Although the regimens in this study were similar in that they included taxane, the mean utility scores and longitudinal patterns of utility scores were different among regimens.",0
Prospective randomized study of surgical morbidity following primary systemic therapy for breast cancer.,"The influence of primary systemic therapy in treating operable breast cancer on postmastectomy morbidity rates was investigated. The contribution of other risk factors was assessed by multiple logistic regression. Seventy-nine eligible patients were randomly allocated, 39 to undergo immediate modified radical mastectomy, and 40 to receive initial cytotoxic or endocrine treatment followed by mastectomy. Postoperative wound seroma, infection and necrosis were recorded prospectively. Fourteen minor and six major complications occurred in 17 patients treated conventionally, while 14 patients developed 11 minor and six major complications after systemic therapy (P > 0.4). Median hospital stay was 8 days for both groups. Age, smoking, immediate breast reconstruction and the type of primary systemic treatment given were not independent predictors of complication risk. Obesity emerged as a significant risk factor for postmastectomy complications (P = 0.015). Primary systemic therapy does not increase the rate of morbidity after mastectomy.",0
Patterns of care in Dutch postmenopausal patients with hormone-sensitive early breast cancer participating in the Tamoxifen Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational (TEAM) trial.,"BACKGROUND: The Tamoxifen and Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational (TEAM) trial investigates the efficacy and safety of adjuvant exemestane alone and in sequence after tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with hormone-sensitive early breast cancer. As there was a nationwide participation in The Netherlands, we studied the variations in patterns of care in the Comprehensive Cancer Centre Regions (CCCRs) and compliance with national guidelines. METHODS: Clinicopathological characteristics, carried out local treatment strategies and adjuvant chemotherapy data were collected. RESULTS: From 2001 to January 2006, 2754 Dutch patients were randomised to the study. Mean age of patients was 65 years (standard deviation 9). Tumours were < or =2 cm in 46% (within CCCRs 39%-50%), node-negative disease varied from 25% to 45%, and PgR status was determined in 75%-100% of patients. Mastectomy was carried out in 55% (45%-70%), sentinel lymph node procedure in 68% (42%-79%) and axillary lymph node dissections in 77% (67%-83%) of patients, all different between CCCRs (P < 0.0001). Adjuvant chemotherapy was given in 15%-70% of eligible patients (P < 0.001). DISCUSSION: In spite of national guidelines, breast cancer treatment on specific issues widely varied between the various Dutch regions. These data provide valuable information for breast cancer organisations indicating (lack of) guideline adherence and areas for breast cancer care improvement.",0
Dexrazoxane cardioprotection for patients receiving FAC chemotherapy: a pharmacoeconomic evaluation.,"Anthracyclines are among the most effective and commonly-prescribed antitumor agents but have dose-limiting cumulative cardiotoxicity. We performed a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of the ability of dexrazoxane to prevent cardiac-related adverse events in patients with Stage IIIB or IV metastatic breast cancer who were treated with a median of 10 cycles of intravenous FAC (5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide) at doses of 500/50/500 mg/m2 respectively. Dexrazoxane was given at 500 mg/m2 commencing at the seventh cycle of treatment. We determined the cost of each cardiac event prevented and the cost of each additional life-year saved by dexrazoxane use. The cost per cardiac event prevented was CDN $5745 and the cost per additional life-year saved was CDN $2856. With the increasing use of anthracyclines in Stages I and II breast cancer, these favorable clinical and economic results may broaden the range of therapeutic possibilities for anthracyclines in adjuvant and metastatic therapy of breast cancer.",0
Zoledronic acid is superior to pamidronate for the treatment of bone metastases in breast carcinoma patients with at least one osteolytic lesion.,"BACKGROUND: Treatment with zoledronic acid (Zol) was compared with a dose of 90 mg of pamidronate (Pam) in breast carcinoma (BC) patients with at least 1 osteolytic lesion based on data from a Phase III, randomized trial. METHODS: Overall, 1130 patients with breast carcinoma who had all types of bone metastases (osteolytic, mixed, or osteoblastic by radiology) were randomized to receive treatment with either 4 mg of Zol or 8 mg of Zol as a 15-minute infusion or 90 mg of Pam as a 2-hour infusion every 3-4 weeks for 12 months. A skeletal-related event (SRE) was defined as a pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, radiotherapy, or surgery to bone. RESULTS: Among all patients with BC, the proportion of those who had an SRE (primary endpoint) was comparable between treatment groups (43% of patients who received 4 mg of Zol vs. 45% of patients who received Pam). Among patients who had breast carcinoma with at least 1 osteolytic lesion (n = 528 patients), the proportion with an SRE was lower in the 4-mg Zol group compared with the Pam group (48% vs. 58%), but this did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.058). The time to first SRE was significantly longer in the 4-mg Zol group compared with the Pam group (median, 310 vs. 174 days; P = 0.013). Moreover, multiple-event analysis demonstrated significant further reductions in the risk of developing SREs over the reduction achieved with Pam (30% in the osteolytic subset [P = 0.010] and 20% for all patients with BC [P = 0.037]). CONCLUSIONS: The current data indicate that treatment with 4 mg of Zol was more effective than 90 mg of Pam in reducing skeletal complications in a subset of patients with breast carcinoma who had at least 1 osteolytic lesion at study entry.",0
A double-blind study of the efficacy of metronidazole gel in the treatment of malodorous fungating tumours.,"A double-blind placebo-controlled trial was undertaken to assess the value of topical metronidazole gel preparation in the palliation of the offensive odour of fungating tumours. This 5 day trial was followed by a 6 day period during which all patients received the active gel. Subjective odour assessments were performed by both patients and medical staff. 11 patients were entered and the randomisation was then halted because of an obvious overall benefit over the whole 11 days. There was a non-significant trend in favour of the active treatment during the initial double-blind placebo-controlled phase of the trial, and no side-effects were observed.",0
"Chemoendocrine therapy for premenopausal women with axillary lymph node-positive, steroid hormone receptor-positive breast cancer: results from INT 0101 (E5188).","PURPOSE: Chemotherapy, tamoxifen, and ovarian ablation/suppression (OA/OS) are effective adjuvant approaches for premenopausal, steroid hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. The value of combined therapy has not been clearly established. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Premenopausal women with axillary lymph node-positive, steroid hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (1,503 eligible patients) were randomly assigned to six cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF), CAF followed by 5 years of monthly goserelin (CAF-Z), or CAF followed by 5 years of monthly goserelin and daily tamoxifen (CAF-ZT). The primary end points were time to recurrence (TTR), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) for CAF-Z versus CAF, and CAF-ZT versus CAF-Z. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 9.6 years, the addition of tamoxifen to CAF-Z improved TTR and DFS but not OS. There was no overall advantage for addition of goserelin to CAF. CONCLUSION: Addition of tamoxifen to CAF-Z improves outcome for premenopausal node-positive, receptor-positive breast cancer. The role of OA/OS alone or with other endocrine agents should be studied more intensely.",1
Randomized phase III study of docetaxel compared with paclitaxel in metastatic breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: This randomized, controlled, multicenter, open-label, phase III study compared docetaxel versus paclitaxel in patients with advanced breast cancer that had progressed after an anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (n = 449) were randomly assigned to receive either docetaxel 100 mg/m2 (n = 225) or paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 (n = 224) on day 1, every 21 days until tumor progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. RESULTS: In the intent-to-treat population, both the median overall survival (OS, 15.4 v 12.7 months; hazard ratio [HR], 1.41; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.73; P = .03) and the median time to progression (TTP, 5.7 months v 3.6 months; HR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.33 to 2.02; P < .0001) for docetaxel were significantly longer than for paclitaxel, and the overall response rate (ORR, 32% v 25%; P = .10) was higher for docetaxel. These results were confirmed by multivariate analyses. The incidence of treatment-related hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities was greater for docetaxel than for paclitaxel; however, quality-of-life scores were not statistically different between treatment groups over time. CONCLUSION: Docetaxel was superior to paclitaxel in terms of OS and TTP. ORR was higher for docetaxel. Hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities occurred more frequently in the docetaxel group. The global quality-of-life scores were similar for both agents over time.",1
The influence of letrozole on serum lipid concentrations in postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer who have completed 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen (NCIC CTG MA.17L).,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate changes in serum lipid parameters {cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides and lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)]}, in postmenopausal women receiving letrozole or placebo after adjuvant tamoxifen for early stage breast cancer (NCIC CTG MA.17L). PATIENTS AND METHODS: MA.17L is a substudy of MA.17, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of letrozole 2.5 mg taken daily for 5 years in postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer completing approximately 5 years of prior adjuvant tamoxifen. Patients consenting to participate in this companion study had blood drawn and lipid parameters (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, Lp(a), triglycerides) evaluated at baseline, 6 months, 12 months and yearly thereafter until completion of protocol therapy. It was required that women be non-hyperlipidemic and not taking lipid-lowering drugs at time of entry on this trial. RESULTS: Three hundred and forty seven women were enrolled in the study. The letrozole and the placebo groups demonstrated marginally significant differences in the percentage change from baseline in HDL cholesterol at 6 months (P=0.049), in LDL cholesterol at 12 months (P=0.033) and triglycerides at 24 months (P=0.036). All comparisons of lipid parameters at other time points were not significantly different between the two treatment groups. No statistically significant differences in the number of patients exceeding the thresholds defined for the lipid parameters were found between the two treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: The MA.17 trial demonstrated a significant improvement in disease-free survival with the use of letrozole as extended adjuvant therapy post tamoxifen. Results from this study suggests that letrozole does not significantly alter serum cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides or Lp(a) in non-hyperlidiemic postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer treated up to 36 months following at least 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy. These findings further support the tolerability of extended adjuvant letrozole in postmenopausal women following standard tamoxifen therapy.",0
"Trastuzumab plus anastrozole versus anastrozole alone for the treatment of postmenopausal women with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive, hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer: results from the randomized phase III TAnDEM study.","PURPOSE: TAnDEM is the first randomized phase III study to combine a hormonal agent and trastuzumab without chemotherapy as treatment for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/hormone receptor-copositive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Postmenopausal women with HER2/hormone receptor-copositive MBC were randomly assigned to anastrozole (1 mg/d orally) with or without trastuzumab (4 mg/kg intravenous infusion on day 1, then 2 mg/kg every week) until progression. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intent-to-treat population. Results Overall, 103 patients received trastuzumab plus anastrozole; 104 received anastrozole alone. Patients in the trastuzumab plus anastrozole arm experienced significant improvements in PFS compared with patients receiving anastrozole alone (hazard ratio = 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.84; median PFS, 4.8 v 2.4 months; log-rank P = .0016). In patients with centrally confirmed hormone receptor positivity (n = 150), median PFS was 5.6 and 3.8 months in the trastuzumab plus anastrozole and anastrozole alone arms, respectively (log-rank P = .006). Overall survival in the overall and centrally confirmed hormone receptor-positive populations showed no statistically significant treatment difference; however, 70% of patients in the anastrozole alone arm crossed over to receive trastuzumab after progression on anastrozole alone. Incidence of grade 3 and 4 adverse events was 23% and 5%, respectively, in the trastuzumab plus anastrozole arm, and 15% and 1%, respectively, in the anastrozole alone arm; one patient in the combination arm experienced New York Heart Association class II congestive heart failure. CONCLUSION: Trastuzumab plus anastrozole improves outcomes for patients with HER2/hormone receptor-copositive MBC compared with anastrozole alone, although adverse events and serious adverse events were more frequent with the combination.",1
"Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial of 6% miltefosine solution, a topical chemotherapy in cutaneous metastases from breast cancer.","PURPOSE: To compare 6% miltefosine solution (Miltex; Asta Medica, Frankfurt, Germany), a new topical cytostatic drug, with placebo as palliative treatment for cutaneous metastases from breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter phase III study, a total of 52 patients with inoperable progressive skin lesions from histologically or cytologically confirmed breast cancer, not manageable by radiotherapy or systemic treatment, with superficial or flat skin lesions (estimated depth of invasion < or = 1 cm) were randomized to receive either 6% miltefosine solution or placebo. The solution was applied at the dose of 2 drops/10 cm(2), once daily during the first week and twice daily thereafter until treatment failure. RESULTS: Treatment groups were well balanced for patient characteristics at study entry except for a small difference in age. Time to treatment failure (TTF), the primary parameter of this study, showed miltefosine solution to be significantly superior to placebo (P = .007); the median TTF in the miltefosine solution group was nearly three times longer than that in the placebo group (56 days v 21 days). The rate of response based on intention to treat patients was 33.3% for miltefosine solution compared with 3.7% for placebo (P = .006). Cutaneous reactions were seen mainly in the miltefosine group, with the type and frequency similar to those observed in previous studies. CONCLUSION: 6% Miltefosine solution is confirmed as an effective palliative treatment option for cutaneous metastases from breast cancer. Skin reactions, when present, are well tolerated and only occasionally require cessation of treatment.",1
Chemotherapy versus observation in high-risk node-negative breast cancer patients.,"Postoperative women with breast cancer but without histopathological evidence of metastases to the axillary lymph nodes or clinical evidence of metastases were studied. Six hundred fifty-five ""good-risk"" patients who were estrogen receptor positive (ER+) with primary tumors less than 3 cm were registered for observation. Twenty-four of these patients were treated with chemotherapy. Five hundred thirty-six ""poor-risk"" patients who were either ER+ with primary tumors greater than or equal to 3 cm or estrogen receptor negative (ER-) with any primary tumor size were randomly assigned between chemotherapy and observation. Randomization was stratified by type of surgical procedure, number of lymph nodes examined, menopausal status, tumor size, and ER status. The chemotherapy (CMFP) consisted of six 4-week cycles of cyclophosphamide, 100 mg/m2 orally days 1-14; methotrexate, 40 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) days 1 and 8; fluorouracil, 600 mg/m2 IV days 1 and 8; and prednisone, 40 mg/m2 orally days 1-14. Treatment arms in the randomly assigned patients were balanced with respect to pretreatment characteristics. This analysis includes 445 eligible patients entered in the registration arm and 425 eligible patients entered into the randomized treatments. The median follow-up is 4.5 years in the randomly assigned cohort and 4.8 years in the registered cohort. The overall 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) among the randomly assigned patients was 83% with CMFP and 61% with observation (P less than .0001). A DFS treatment benefit was observed in premenopausal and postmenopausal patients as well as in patients with ER+ or ER- tumors. There were fewer local-regional and distant relapses among the CMFP-treated patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1
Preoperative chemotherapy in patients with operable breast cancer: nine-year results from National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-18.,"National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) Protocol B-18 was initiated in 1988 to determine whether four cycles of doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide given preoperatively improve survival and disease-free survival (DFS) when compared with the same chemotherapy given postoperatively. Secondary aims included the evaluation of preoperative chemotherapy in downstaging the primary breast tumor and involved axillary lymph nodes, the comparison of lumpectomy rates and rates of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) in the two treatment groups, and the assessment of the correlation between primary tumor response and outcome. Initially published findings were based on a follow-up of 5 years; this report updates results through 9 years of follow-up. There continue to be no statistically significant overall differences in survival or DFS between the two treatment groups. Survival at 9 years is 70% in the postoperative group and 69% in the preoperative group (P =.80). DFS is 53% in postoperative patients and 55% in preoperative patients (P =.50). A statistically significant correlation persists between primary tumor response and outcome, and this correlation has become statistically stronger with longer follow-up. Patients assigned to preoperative chemotherapy received notably more lumpectomies than postoperative patients, especially among patients with tumors greater than 5 cm at study entry. Although the rate of IBTR was slightly higher in the preoperative group (10.7% versus 7.6%), this difference was not statistically significant. Marginally statistically significant treatment-by-age interactions appear to be emerging for survival and DFS, suggesting that younger patients may benefit from preoperative therapy, whereas the reverse may be true for older patients.",1

Changes in gene expression associated with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: At present, clinically useful markers predicting response of primary breast carcinomas to either doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide (AC) or doxorubicin-docetaxel (AD) are lacking. We investigated whether gene expression profiles of the primary tumor could be used to predict treatment response to either of those chemotherapy regimens. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Within a single-institution, randomized, phase II trial, patients with locally advanced breast cancer received six courses of either AC (n = 24) or AD (n = 24) neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Gene expression profiles were generated from core-needle biopsies obtained before treatment and correlated with the response of the primary tumor to the chemotherapy administered. Additionally, pretreatment gene expression profiles were compared with those in tumors remaining after chemotherapy. RESULTS: Ten (20%) of 48 patients showed a (near) pathologic complete remission of the primary tumor after treatment. No gene expression pattern correlating with response could be identified for all patients or for the AC or AD groups separately. The comparison of the pretreatment biopsy and the tumor excised after chemotherapy revealed differences in gene expression in tumors that showed a partial remission but not in tumors that did not respond to chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: No gene expression profile predicting the response of primary breast carcinomas to AC- or AD-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy could be detected in this interim analysis. More subtle differences in gene expression are likely to be present but can only be reliably identified by studying a larger group of patients. Response of a breast tumor to neoadjuvant chemotherapy results in alterations in gene expression.",0
The effects on lipid serum levels of a 2-year adjuvant treatment with exemestane after tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: The third-generation aromatase inhibitor exemestane represents a new development in the treatment of estrogen-positive breast cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects on lipid profile and body composition of the shift from tamoxifen to exemestane. METHODS: After 2-3 years of tamoxifen adjuvant treatment, 68 postmenopausal women were randomly assigned to either continue tamoxifen 20 mg/day (n = 35) or to switch to exemestane 25 mg/day (n = 33). RESULTS: No significant changes in lipid profile were found in patients continuing on tamoxifen. In the exemestane group, serum HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides (TG) decreased significantly (p < 0.01) and serum LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) increased significantly (p < 0.05) with respect to baseline. The difference between the two groups was significant. Moreover, in the exemestane group, fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) showed an opposite trend, which determined a progressive and significant increase in the FFM/FM ratio. CONCLUSION: This study shows that the choice of first-line treatment or adjuvant therapy for breast cancer should also take the individual lipid and body composition profile into account.",0
Significant survival benefit of node-negative breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy: seven-year results.,,1
Phase II evaluation of thalidomide in patients with metastatic breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: To determine the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and effect on serum angiogenic growth factors of two dose levels of thalidomide in patients with metastatic breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with progressive metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive either daily 200 mg of thalidomide or 800 mg to be escalated to 1,200 mg. Fourteen heavily pretreated patients were assigned to each dose level. Each cycle consisted of 8 weeks of treatment. Pharmacokinetics and growth factor serum levels were evaluated. RESULTS: No patient had a true partial or complete response. On the 800-mg arm, 13 patients had progressive disease at or before 8 weeks of treatment and one refused to continue treatment. The dose was reduced because of somnolence to 600 mg for five patients and to 400 mg for two and was increased for one to 1,000 mg and for four to 1,200 mg. On the 200-mg arm, 12 patients had progressive disease at or before 8 weeks and two had stable disease at 8 weeks, of whom one was removed from study at week 11 because of grade 3 neuropathy and the other had progressive disease at week 16. Dose-limiting toxicities included somnolence and neuropathy. Adverse events that did not require dose or schedule modifications included constipation, fatigue, dry mouth, dizziness, nausea, anorexia, arrhythmia, headaches, skin rash, hypotension, and neutropenia. Evaluation of circulating angiogenic factors and pharmacokinetic studies failed to provide insight into the reason for the lack of efficacy. CONCLUSION: Single-agent thalidomide has little or no activity in patients with heavily pretreated breast cancer. Further studies that include different patient populations and/or combinations with other agents might be performed at the lower dose levels.",1
"A prospective randomized trial comparing epirubicin monochemotherapy to two fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide, and epirubicin regimens differing in epirubicin dose in advanced breast cancer patients. The French Epirubicin Study Group.","The French Epirubicin Study Group carried out a randomized trial comparing epirubicin alone 75 mg/m2 with fluorouracil (5FU) 500 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2, and epirubicin 50 mg/m2 (FEC 50) and 5FU 500 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2, and epirubicin 75 mg/m2 (FEC 75) as first treatment for advanced breast cancer patients. Patients were stratified according to whether or not there were bone metastases only. Four hundred twelve patients entered this trial; 378 were assessable for tolerability and 365 for efficacy. The overall response rates were comparable between FEC 50 (44.6%) and FEC 75 (44.7%), but both were better than the epirubicin alone (30.6%) (P = .04 and P = .0006, respectively). The complete response rate was better in FEC 75 (15.5%) than in FEC 50 (7%) (P = .025) or epirubicin (4%) (P = .002). Similar results were obtained in the group of patients without bone-only metastases. No difference in the three treatments was observed in the patients with bone metastases only. Mean durations of response were similar in the three groups, being 412 days, 440 days, and 350 days for FEC 50, FEC 75, and epirubicin, respectively. Patients without previous adjuvant chemotherapy fared better than those with previous treatment (without anthracyclines). Tolerability was fair in the three groups. Overall, the epirubicin-alone group showed better tolerance than the two other groups, which did not differ significantly. Time to progression and survival were not different among the three groups, but more early relapses occurred in the epirubicin and FEC 50 groups; survival seemed to be better during the first 8 months in the FEC 75 group, and the survival difference between the epirubicin group and the FEC 75 group was of borderline significance. No difference in survival was observed between epirubicin- and FEC 50-group patients, even though the response rate was significantly worse in the monochemotherapy group.",1
Population pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of docetaxel in phase II studies in patients with cancer.,"PURPOSE: The population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) approach was prospectively integrated in the clinical development of docetaxel to assess the PK profile in a large population of patients and investigate systemic exposure as a prognostic factor for clinical outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: PK analysis was performed at first course in 24 phase II studies of docetaxel monotherapy using four randomized limited-sampling schedules. Bayesian estimates of clearance (CL), area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), and peak and duration of plasma levels greater than threshold levels were used as measures of exposure. PD data included for efficacy, response rate, time to first response, and time to progression (TTP) in breast cancer and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and for toxicity, grade 4 neutropenia, and febrile neutropenia at first course and time to onset of fluid retention. PK/PD analysis was conducted using logistic and Cox multivariate regression models. RESULTS: PK protocol implementation was successful. Most of the patients registered (721 of 936, 77%) were sampled and 68% were assessable for PK (640 patients). First-course docetaxel AUC was a significant predictor (P = .0232) of TTP in NSCLC (n = 151). Docetaxel CL was a strong independent predictor (P < .0001) of both grade 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia (n = 582). Cumulative dose was the strongest predictor (P < .0001) of the time to onset of fluid retention (n = 631). However, the duration of exposure over 0.20 micromol/L (0.16 microg/mL) at first course was an independent predictor (P = .0029). Few patients (n = 25, 4%) received the recommended dexamethasone premedication. CONCLUSION: First-course docetaxel PK is a predictor of first-course hematologic toxicity, but also of fluid retention, which is cumulative in nature. Patients with elevated hepatic enzymes have a 27% reduction in docetaxel CL and are at a higher risk of toxicity. A starting dose of 75 mg/m2 is currently being evaluated in this population. Prospective implementation of large-scale population PK/PD evaluation is feasible in early drug development and this approach generates clinically relevant findings.",0
Phase II randomized study of neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole compared with placebo plus letrozole in patients with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: Cross-talk between the estrogen receptor (ER) and the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways is a mechanism of resistance to endocrine therapy, and blockade of both pathways enhances antitumor activity in preclinical models. This study explored whether sensitivity to letrozole was enhanced with the oral mTOR inhibitor, everolimus (RAD001).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred seventy postmenopausal women with operable ER-positive breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive 4 months of neoadjuvant treatment with letrozole (2.5 mg/day) and either everolimus (10 mg/day) or placebo. The primary end point was clinical response by palpation. Mandatory biopsies were obtained at baseline and after 2 weeks of treatment (ie, day 15). Samples were assessed for PI3K mutation status (PIK3CA) and for pharmacodynamic changes of Ki67, phospho-S6, cyclin D1, and progesterone receptor (PgR) by immunohistochemistry.RESULTS: Response rate by clinical palpation in the everolimus arm was higher than that with letrozole alone (ie, placebo; 68.1% v 59.1%), which was statistically significant at the preplanned, one-sided, alpha = 0.1 level (P = .062). Marked reductions in progesterone receptor and cyclin D1 expression occurred in both treatment arms, and dramatic downregulation of phospho-S6 occurred only in the everolimus arm. An antiproliferative response, as defined by a reduction in Ki67 expression to natural logarithm of percentage positive Ki67 of less than 1 at day 15, occurred in 52 (57%) of 91 patients in the everolimus arm and in 25 (30%) of 82 patients in the placebo arm (P < .01). The safety profile was consistent with historical results of everolimus monotherapy; grades 3 to 4 adverse events occurred in 22.6% of patients who received everolimus and in 3.8% of patients who received placebo.CONCLUSION: Everolimus significantly increased letrozole efficacy in neoadjuvant therapy of patients with ER-positive breast cancer.",1
"Relationship between quantitative estrogen and progesterone receptor expression and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) status with recurrence in the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination trial.","PURPOSE: To determine the relationship between quantitative estrogen-receptor (ER) and progesterone-receptor (PgR) expression and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER-2) status with time to recurrence (TTR) in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive primary breast cancer treated with anastrozole or tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor blocks were retrospectively collected from patients in the monotherapy arms of the Arimidex, Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination (ATAC) trial and centrally tested for ER, PgR and HER-2. ER and PgR were scored using continuous scales and HER-2 was scored as 0 to 3+ with 2+ cases being analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. RESULTS: Blocks were collected from 2,006 of 5,880 eligible patients. Tissue was assessable and ER and/or PgR positivity confirmed centrally in 1,782 cases. In these, TTR was longer for anastrozole than for tamoxifen by a similar extent to that in the overall trial. None of the three biomarkers identified a set of patients with differential benefit from anastrozole over tamoxifen. Patients with low ER, low PgR, and high HER-2 expression had a poorer prognosis with either drug. Only 2.6% of patients in the highest quartile of PgR experienced recurrence after 5 years, compared with 13.2% in the lowest quartile. CONCLUSION: Quantitative expression of ER and PgR and HER-2 status did not identify patients with differential relative benefit from anastrozole over tamoxifen: TTR was longer for anastrozole than for tamoxifen in all molecular subgroups. Low ER or PgR or high HER-2 expression are associated with a high risk of recurrence with either anastrozole or tamoxifen.",0
"Randomized trial comparing cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) with rotational CMF, epirubicin and vincristine as primary chemotherapy in operable breast carcinoma.","BACKGROUND: According to the overview of Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group, anthracycline containing regimens are superior to cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) as adjuvant chemotherapy for breast carcinoma, but no comparative information is available in terms of primary chemotherapy. In the current randomized controlled trial, the authors compared CMF with a chemotherapy regimen including CMF, epirubicin, and vincristine (CMFEV). METHODS: Two hundred eleven patients with Stages I and II palpable breast carcinoma and tumor diameter > 2.5 cm or < or = 2.5 cm with cytologically proven axillary lymph node involvement were randomized to receive CMF (arm A) or CMFEV regimen (arm B) for four cycles before surgery. After surgery, patients in both arms received adjuvant CMF for three cycles; the postmenopausal patients also received tamoxifen for two years. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the complete response (CR) and in the CR plus partial response (PR) rates between the two arms. In the subset analysis, among premenopausal patients, significantly higher rates of CR (26% vs 4%, P = 0.004) and of CR + PR rates (80% vs 54%, P = 0.007) were observed in the CMFEV, as compared to the CMF arm. Multivariate analysis confirmed the presence of a significant interaction between menopausal status and type of treatment on the probability of achieving CR (P = 0.02) or CR + PR (P = 0.01). There were no major differences in the side effects of the two treatments, with the exception of more frequent alopecia in the experimental arm. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study are in line with those of previous published randomized clinical trials comparing regimens without and with anthracycline as adjuvant treatment, indicating an agreement between the short term response to primary chemotherapy and the long term results observed in the adjuvant setting.",1
HER-2 and topo-isomerase IIalpha as predictive markers in a population of node-positive breast cancer patients randomly treated with adjuvant CMF or epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide.,"BACKGROUND: The predictive role of HER-2 in node-positive breast cancer patients receiving CMF or an anthracycline-based adjuvant therapy remains unclear. In addition, topo-isomerase II alpha (topo IIalpha), as the cellular target of anthracyclines, might have value as a predictive marker. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred eighty-one archival primary tumor samples were collected among 777 patients entered into a multicenter phase III trial comparing classical CMF with epirubicin cyclophosphamide (HEC) as adjuvant therapy of node-positive breast cancer. HER-2 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using different antibodies (Abs). Topo IIalpha was evaluated by IHC using the Ab KiS 1. In each subgroup of patients identified by HER-2 and topo IIalpha, adjusted hazard ratios for event-free survival (EFS) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals have been calculated for the different study comparisons. An interaction test has been performed to investigate the role of HER-2 and topo IIalpha as predictive markers. RESULTS: When HER-2 was evaluated by CB-11 and 4D5 mAbs, the EFS adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for the main study comparison HEC vs. CMF were: HER-2 positive: 0.33 (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.09 1.27, P = 0.08), HER-2 negative: 1.16 (95%, CI: 0.71-1.90, P = 0.56); the P-value for the interaction test was 0.10. When HER-2 was evaluated by TAB-250 + pAbl Abs, the adjusted HR for the same comparison were: HER-2 positive: 1.06 (95% CI: 0.45-2.52, P = 0.90), HER-2 negative: 0.99 (95% CI: 0.58-1.68, P = 0.97); the P-value for the interaction test was 0.84. With regard to topo IIalpha, the adjusted HR for the EFS comparison HEC vs. CMF were: topo IIalpha positive: 0.66 (95% CI: 0.32-1.36, P = 0.25), topo IIalpha negative: 1.26 (95% CI: 0.63-2.50, P = 0.51); the P-value for the interaction test was 0.13. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that in node-positive breast cancer patients randomly treated with CMF or an epirubicin-based regimen, the predictive value of HER-2 may vary according to the Abs used in the immunohistochemistry assay. In addition, the study supports the concept that topo IIalpha might be involved in the determination of tumor responsiveness to an anthracycline-based adjuvant therapy.",0
Oral glutamine ameliorates chemotherapy-induced changes of intestinal permeability and does not interfere with the antitumor effect of chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer: a prospective randomized trial.,"AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Sixty patients with breast cancer were randomly assigned to oral glutamine or placebo pre-neoadjuvant chemotherapy (CEF regimen). METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Oral glutamine supplementation was continued for at least 12 days. Patients kept a daily record of diarrhea and stomatitis. The plasma glutamine level, intestinal permeability (lactulose-mannitol test), and tumor size were analyzed. The expression of Ki-67 and PCNA antigens in breast carcinoma was assessed. RESULTS: The plasma glutamine level was significantly higher in the glutamine group than in the placebo group (420.39 +/- 52.39 mmol/L vs 309.76 +/- 42.34 mmol/L, P < 0.05). After one cycle of chemotherapy, the lactulose-mannitol ratio was higher in the placebo group than in the glutamine group (0.0630 +/- 0.0091 vs 0.0471 +/- 0.0094, P < 0.05). No differences were observed in the grades of stomatitis and diarrhea, in the changes in tumor size, and in the expression of Ki-67 and PCNA antigens between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic oral glutamine could ameliorate the neoadjuvant chemotherapy-induced increase in intestinal permeability, but had no significant positive clinical effect on stomatitis and diarrhea and did not interfere with the antitumor effect of chemotherapy.",0
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer: significantly enhanced response with docetaxel.,"PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy of neoadjuvant (NA) docetaxel (DOC) with anthracycline-based therapy and determine the efficacy of NA DOC in patients with breast cancer initially failing to respond to anthracycline-based NA chemotherapy (CT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with large or locally advanced breast cancer received four pulses of cyclophosphamide 1,000 mg/m(2), doxorubicin 50 mg/m(2), vincristine 1.5 mg/m(2), and prednisolone 40 mg (4 x CVAP) for 5 days. Clinical tumor response was assessed. Those who responded (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) were randomized to receive further 4 x CVAP or 4 x DOC (100 mg/m(2)). All nonresponders received 4 x DOC. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-two patients were enrolled; 145 patients completed eight cycles of NA CT. One hundred two patients (66%) achieved a clinical response (PR or CR) after 4 x CVAP. After randomization, 50 patients received 4 x CVAP and 47 patients received 4 x DOC. In patients who received eight cycles of CT, the clinical CR (cCR) and clinical PR (cPR) (94% v 66%) and pathologic CR (pCR) (34% v 16%) response rates were higher (P =.001 and P =.04) in those who received further DOC. Intention-to-treat analysis demonstrated cCR and cPR (85% v 64%; P =.03) and pCR (31% v 15%; P =.06). Axillary lymph node examination revealed residual tumor in 33% of patients who received 8 x CVAP and 38% of patients who received further DOC. In patients who failed to respond to the initial CVAP, 4 x DOC resulted in a cCR and cPR rate of 55% and a pCR rate of 2%. Forty-four percent of these patients had residual tumor within axillary lymph nodes. CONCLUSION: NA DOC resulted in substantial improvement in responses to DOC.",1
Vindesine-mitoxantrone (VM) versus vindesine-4'-epidoxorubicin (VE) in metastatic breast cancer: a prospective randomized trial.,"182 patients with metastatic breast cancer were randomized to V (mg/m2 i.v.) and M (10 mg/m2 i.v.) or E (40 mg/m2 i.v.) every 3 weeks x 3 and then every 4 weeks; they were stratified by sites of disease (visceral, bone, or soft-tissue dominant) and by prior chemotherapy. In a preliminary analysis there is a significant difference regarding frequency of alopecia (WHO Grade 3 or 4) favoring regimen VM; gastrointestinal, hematologic and neurotoxic side effects were mild and similar for both groups. Of 114 evaluable women there is a response rate (CR + PR) of 26% and 34% for VM and VE respectively (n.s.), and there is no significant difference between the 2 groups in time to progression and survival. Both regimens are well tolerated and seem to be equally effective. The median follow-up time is too short to draw final conclusions.",1
Cardiovascular risk profile of patients with HER2/neu-positive breast cancer treated with anthracycline-taxane-containing adjuvant chemotherapy and/or trastuzumab.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the cardiovascular risk profile of a subset of patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with adjuvant taxane-anthracycline-containing chemotherapy and/or trastuzumab (Herceptin). Experimental Design: Twenty-six patients with breast cancer (mean, 20 months postchemotherapy) and 10 healthy age-matched women were studied. We measured 14 metabolic and vascular established cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, body mass index, cardiorespiratory fitness, and left ventricular systolic function. All assessments were done within a 14-day period. RESULTS: Cardiac abnormalities were suggested by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <50% in 8% of patients, LVEF remained >10% below pretreatment values in 38%, whereas 50% presented with resting sinus tachycardia. Brain natriuretic peptide was significantly elevated in 40% of patients and was correlated with LVEF (r = -0.72, P =or< 0.001). For the majority of CVD risk factors, similar proportions of patients and controls (35-60%) were classified as ""undesirable."" A significantly higher proportion of patients were classified with low cardiorespiratory fitness (46% versus 0%, P < 0.01), being overweight/obese (72% versus 50%, P < 0.05), and having resting sinus tachycardia (50% versus 0%, P < 0.01) compared with controls. Cardiorespiratory fitness and body mass index were correlated with CVD risk factors (r = -0.64 to 0.63, P < 0.05; r = -0.63 to 0.67, P < 0.05, respectively). Exploratory analyses revealed several differences between CVD risk factors based on chemotherapy regimen. CONCLUSION: Breast cancer survivors treated with adjuvant chemotherapy are at a higher risk of developing late-occurring CVD than age-matched controls due to direct and indirect treatment-related toxicity.",0
Upregulation of HER-2/neu by ovarian ablation: results of a randomized trial comparing leuprorelin to CMF as adjuvant therapy in node-positive breast cancer patients.,"PURPOSE: HER-2/neu oncogene expression is modulated by an estrogen-sensitive binding site in the HER-2/neu promoter. Utilizing the circulating antigen of HER-2/neu in serum (sHER-2/neu) as a surrogate marker we investigated whether ovarian ablation by adjuvant therapy leads to an upregulation of HER-2/neu in breast cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The analysis was done on sera from premenopausal, node-positive, hormone-receptor positive patients randomized in a multi-center trial. The study was designed with patients receiving either 11.25 mg of leuprorelin s.c. every 3 months over 2 years or CMF chemotherapy for 6 cycles. Sera, available from 80 patients in the leuprorelin arm and from 53 patients in the CMF arm, were collected at 0, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 30 months. sHER-2/neu was measured using a standardized ELISA assay that has an upper limit of normal of 15 ng/ml. sHER-2/neu results were correlated to the levels of LH, FSH and estradiol as indicators of ovarian ablation and to the tumor marker, CA 27.29. RESULTS: During estradiol deprivation, sHER-2/neu levels increased significantly by more than one third from 8.1 ng/ml to 11.0 ng/ml (p < 0.0001) in both treatment arms. The most pronounced relative increase occurred within the first 3 months (p < 0.001). In only 2.7% (16/587) of sHER-2/neu measurements, the sHER-2/neu results were elevated above 15 ng/ml, confirming the upper limit of normal for breast cancer patients irrespective of their menopausal status. At month 30, the sHER-2/neu level started to decrease in the leuprorelin arm, reflecting reversible castration and estradiol reconstitution. Conversely, CA 27.29 levels did not show a trend over time, indicating that sHER-2/neu changes were of a regulatory nature and were not merely a reflection of increasing residual disease. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates the upregulation of HER-2/neu during ovarian ablation. These results are consistent with data showing that the percentage of HER-2/neu positive tumors, evaluated by standardized immunohistochemistry on the primary tumor, is significantly increased during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle (Balsari et al., Am J Pathol 155: 1543-1547, 1999). Regulatory processes at the HER-2/neu gene should be considered when prescribing specific therapy for breast cancer.",0
Continuous-infusion granisetron compared to ondansetron for the prevention of nausea and vomiting after high-dose chemotherapy.,"PURPOSE: The serotonin receptor antagonists effectively prevent emesis with little toxicity when employed with standard doses of emetogenic chemotherapy. The optimal approach to the prevention of the emesis associated with the high doses of chemotherapy used for autologous stem cell transplantation is not known. A randomized controlled trial was designed to assess the relative efficacy and toxicity of granisetron compared to ondansetron in the setting of autologous stem cell transplantation. METHODS: A group of 48 patients with breast cancer were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive either (1) granisetron as a 0.5-mg i.v. bolus 30 min. before chemotherapy followed by a continuous infusion of 0.04 mg/h (1 mg/day) for 7 days or (2) ondansetron as an 8-mg i.v. bolus 30 min before chemotherapy followed by a continuous infusion of 1 mg/h (24 mg/day) for 7 days. All patients also received 10 mg dexamethasone/day i.v. for 7 days. Chemotherapy consisted of 1500 mg cyclophosphamide per m2/day, 125 mg thiotepa m(-2) day(-1), and 200 mg carboplatin per m2/day all as a continuous infusion for 4 consecutive days. The two study arms were then compared for the incidence and severity of nausea, incidence of emesis, number of salvage anti-emetics required, cost, and toxicity. RESULTS: A total of 46 patients were evaluable. The treatment arms were well-balanced for known risk factors for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Compliance with self-reporting of nausea and vomiting was poor but indicated no difference between the two treatment arms. The average number of anti-emetics required was 15.8 in both treatment arms and the average time to the first dose of a salvage anti-emetic was 2.8 days in the granisetron arm and 2.9 days in the ondansetron arm. The incidence of headache was 36 % in the granisetron arm and 39 % in the ondansetron arm. None of these differences was statistically significant. The use of granisetron resulted in a cost saving of 6.5 %. CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference between granisetron and ondansetron in either efficacy or toxicity. At our institution, the use of granisetron resulted in a moderate cost saving.",0
"Clinical relevance of different sequencing of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and Fluorouracil in operable breast cancer.","PURPOSE: To assess the clinical relevance of different sequences of doxorubicin (DOX) and cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) in patients with operable breast cancer at risk of disease relapse. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two randomized trials were activated in the early 1980s. The first study, in patients with one to three involved nodes, was intended to assess the effectiveness of intravenous (i.v.) CMF given every 3 weeks for 12 courses versus eight courses of the same CMF regimen followed by four courses of full-dose DOX (CMF-->DOX). The second study, in patients with more than three involved nodes, compared four courses of full-dose DOX sequentially followed by eight courses of i.v. CMF (DOX-->CMF) versus alternating two courses of the same CMF regimen with one course of DOX (CMF/DOX) for a total of 12 courses. RESULTS: After a median observation of 210 months, no statistically significant difference was documented in the first study (relapse-free survival hazard rate [HR], 1.06; total survival HR, 1.03). In contrast, the delivery of DOX first, followed by CMF significantly reduced the risk of disease relapse (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.87; P =.0017) and death (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.95; P =.018) compared with the alternating regimen. CONCLUSION: Anthracycline-containing regimens can further reduce the odds of relapse and death compared with CMF. However, the findings observed in our trials emphasize that the relative merits of anthracycline adjuvant programs also can depend on the modality of administration and must be assessed in properly designed trials in which the magnitude of the benefits can be weighed against potential risks.",0
"Serum cytokine levels of interleukin-1beta, -6, -8, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor in breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen and supplemented with co-enzyme Q(10), riboflavin and niacin.","The prognostic significance of supplementing co-enzyme Q(10) (CoQ(10)), riboflavin and niacin (CoRN) along with tamoxifen to breast cancer patients was evaluated by measuring the serum cytokine levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and vascular endothelial growth factor. In the present study, 84 breast cancer patients were randomized to receive a daily supplement of CoQ(10) 100 mg, riboflavin 10 mg and niacin 50 mg, one dosage per day along with tamoxifen 10 mg twice a day. Serum cytokine levels were elevated in untreated breast cancer patients (Group II) and significantly reduced after tamoxifen therapy for more than 1 year (Group III). When group III breast cancer patients were supplemented with CoRN for 45 days (Group IV) and 90 days (Group V) along with tamoxifen, a significant reduction in cytokine levels were observed (P < 0.05). Such a decrease in serum cytokine levels after CoRN supplementation in breast cancer patients may suggest good prognosis and efficacy of the treatment, and might even offer protection from metastases and recurrence of cancer.",0
Prospective study of long-term impact of adjuvant high-dose and conventional-dose chemotherapy on health-related quality of life.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate and compare health-related quality of life (HRQOL) after conventional- and high-dose adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with high-risk breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to either a conventional or high-dose chemotherapy regimen; both regimens were followed by radiotherapy and tamoxifen. HRQOL was evaluated until disease progression using the Short Form-36 (SF-36), Visual Analog Scale, and Rotterdam Symptom Checklist and assessed every 6 months for 5 years after random assignment. For the SF-36, data from healthy Dutch women with the same age distribution served as reference values. RESULTS: Eight hundred four patients (conventional-dose chemotherapy, n = 405; high-dose chemotherapy, n = 399) were included. Median follow-up time was 57 months. Directly after high-dose chemotherapy, HRQOL decreased more compared with conventional chemotherapy for all SF-36 subscales. After 1 year, the reference value of healthy women was reached in both groups. Small differences were observed between the two groups in the role-physical and role-emotional subscales, but 1 year after treatment, these differences were minor and not clinically relevant. During follow-up, patients with a lower educational level and many complaints before chemotherapy experienced a worse HRQOL. CONCLUSION: Shortly after high-dose chemotherapy, HRQOL was more affected than after conventional-dose chemotherapy. One year after random assignment, differences were negligible. Identifying patients who have a higher chance of persistent impaired quality of life after treatment (which, in the present study, included patients with a lower educational level and many complaints before chemotherapy) is important and may open the way for better patient-tailored prevention strategies.",0
T cell infiltration of the prostate induced by androgen withdrawal in patients with prostate cancer.,"Manipulations capable of breaking host tolerance to induce tissue-specific T cell-mediated inflammation are of central importance to tumor immunotherapy and our understanding of autoimmunity. We demonstrate that androgen ablative therapy induces profuse T cell infiltration of benign glands and tumors in human prostates. T cell infiltration is readily apparent after 7-28 days of therapy and is comprised predominantly of a response by CD4+ T cells and comparatively fewer CD8+ T cells. Also, T cells within the treated prostate exhibit restricted TCR Vbeta gene usage, consistent with a local oligoclonal response. Recruitment/activation of antigen-presenting cells in treated prostate tissues may contribute to local T cell activation. The induction of T cell infiltration in prostate tissues treated with androgen ablation may have implications for the immunotherapeutic treatment of prostate cancer as well as other hormone-sensitive malignancies, including breast carcinoma.",0
Radiological measurement of breast cancer metastases to lung and liver: comparison between WHO (bidimensional) and RECIST (unidimensional) guidelines.,"PURPOSE: Radiologic assessment of ""response-to-treatment"" during clinical trials of anticancer drugs has been conventionally based on bidirectional tumor measurement. Recently, the revised guidelines were published, which recommended unidirectional tumor measurements. The purpose of this study was to compare response to treatment between the two measurement techniques in breast cancer patients with lung and liver metastases. METHOD: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography studies of 86 breast cancer patients who had lung (n = 27) and liver (n = 59) metastases and who were enrolled in a phase-III oncology trial were evaluated before initiation of treatment and at 6 months after treatment. Lesions were measured by subspecialist radiologists on digitized images using electronic calipers. The largest diameter of the lesions was extracted from bidimensional measurements. Response to treatment was categorized into one of four categories: complete response indicating lesion disappearance, partial response indicating >30% decrease in tumor diameter, or >50% reduction in tumor area, disease progression indicating >20% increase in tumor diameter, or >25% increase in tumor area, and stable disease (neither complete response, partial response, nor disease progression). Response to treatment between the two measurement techniques was compared statistically using the chi2 test. RESULTS: Response to treatment was concordant in 76 patients between unidimensional and bidimensional measurement techniques. In 5 patients (2 lung and 3 liver metastases) the response assessment was improved using unidimensional criteria and in 5 patients (2 lung and 3 liver metastases) the response was worse using unidimensional guidelines. Thus, the overall response rate was 50% for both unidimensional and bidimensional measurement techniques. There was no statistical difference between the two techniques. CONCLUSION: Unidimensional measurements are appropriate for measuring the size of liver and lung metastases for determining response to treatment during clinical testing of oncologic drugs.",0
"Paclitaxel, UFT, and calcium folinate in metastatic breast cancer.","This is a phase I dose-escalation study of uracil and tegafur (in a molar ratio of 4:1 [UFT]) administered in combination with calcium folinate and paclitaxel in metastatic breast cancer. This trial was initiated to 1) determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicities of UFT plus calcium folinate (Orzel) administered three times per day for 21 days in combination with paclitaxel; and 2) define the appropriate dose for phase II testing. Thus far, 14 patients have been accrued to three dose levels. Two patients developed dose-limiting toxicities at dose level 3. One patient experienced grade 3 hypotension. A second patient experienced grade 3 vomiting, grade 4 diarrhea, and severe hand-foot syndrome. Two partial responses and one complete response have been observed. Early trends suggest that this regimen is active in metastatic breast cancer and is well tolerated. Completion of this study is anticipated in 1999.",1
A randomised study to compare the effect of the luteinising hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue goserelin with or without tamoxifen in pre- and perimenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer.,"The use of goserelin with or without tamoxifen was investigated in a randomised multicentre study involving 318 pre- and perimenopausal advanced breast cancer patients. With a median follow-up of 93 weeks, 31% of goserelin-treated patients had objective responses (UICC criteria) compared with 38% of goserelin plus tamoxifen-treated patients (P = 0.24). There was a modest benefit in favour of combination therapy in time to progression (P = 0.03) but not in survival (P = 0.25). Median follow-up for survival was 117.5 weeks. Median times for disease progression and survival were 23 and 127 weeks in the goserelin alone group and 28 and 140 weeks in the combination group, respectively. In 115 patients with skeletal metastases only, significant differences in favour of combination therapy were seen in response rate, time to progression and survival. Both treatments were well tolerated and no additional safety issues were associated with combination therapy.",1
Immunochemotherapies versus chemotherapy as adjuvant treatment after curative resection of operable breast cancer.,"In our previous study, oral adjuvant combination chemotherapy of 5-fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide, mitomycin C, and predonisolone (FEMP) after curative resection of operable breast cancer with vascular invasion in the tumor and/or in the metastatic lymph node was found to be more effective than one course of mitomycin C or cyclic course of mitomycin C. In the present study, we have assessed the efficacy of protein-bound polysaccharide (PSK) or levamisole (LMS) in addition to FEMP. Between January 1980 and December 1990, 227 operable breast cancer patients with vascular invasion in the tumor and/or in the metastatic lymph node were randomized into FEMP, FEMP + LMS, or FEMP + PSK. The risk ratio was lower in the FEMP + PSK group compared to the FEMP group. In disease-free survival or overall survival, there was no significant difference between the three groups, however, the survival curve of the FEMP + PSK group tended to be better than that of the FEMP group(logrank, P = 0.0706; generalized Wilcoxon, P = 0.0739). Side effects were observed at a low incidence, but they were mild and tolerable. Immunochemotherapy using PSK improved the prognosis of patients with operable breast cancer with vascular invasion.",0
"Randomized, placebo-controlled trial of clodronate in patients with primary operable breast cancer.","PURPOSE: The development of bone metastases depends on tumor-induced osteoclastic resorption of bone, which may be inhibited by the antiosteolytic bisphosphonate clodronate. Given to patients with primary breast cancer, clodronate might reduce the subsequent incidence of bone metastases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This double-blind, multicenter trial accrued 1,069 assessable patients with operable breast cancer between 1989 and 1995. All patients received surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and tamoxifen as required. Patients were randomized to receive oral clodronate 1,600 mg/d or a placebo for 2 years starting within 6 months of primary treatment. The primary end point was relapse in bone, analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis, during the medication period and during the total follow-up period (median follow-up, 2,007 days). Secondary end points were relapse in other sites, mortality, and toxicity. RESULTS: During the total follow-up period, there was a nonsignificant reduction in occurrence of bone metastases (clodronate, n = 63; placebo, n = 80; hazards ratio [HR], 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56 to 1.08; P =.127). During the medication period there was a significant reduction in the occurrence of bone metastases (clodronate, n = 12; placebo, n = 28; HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.86; P =.016). The occurrence of nonosseous metastases was similar (clodronate, n = 112; placebo, n = 128; P =.257), but there was a significant reduction in mortality (clodronate, n = 98; placebo, n = 129; P =.047) during the total follow-up period. CONCLUSION: Clodronate, given to patients with primary operable breast cancer, may reduce the occurrence of bone metastases, although this reduction was only significant during this medication period. There was a significant reduction in mortality.",1
Retrospective analysis of time to recurrence in the ATAC trial according to hormone receptor status: an hypothesis-generating study.,"PURPOSE: Arimidex, tamoxifen alone, or in combination (ATAC) trial of anastrozole (Arimidex) versus tamoxifen or a combination of the two in 9,366 postmenopausal patients with primary breast cancer found a significant improvement in disease-free survival and time to recurrence (TTR) for anastrozole compared with tamoxifen, that was restricted to patients with hormone receptor-positive (ie, estrogen receptor-positive [ER+] and/or progesterone receptor-positive [PgR+]) disease, the target population for these therapies. We retrospectively tested the hypothesis that this benefit might differ according to PgR status. PATIENTS AND METHODS: TTR was compared between the three treatment groups for subgroups defined by ER and PgR status using Cox's proportional hazards model, with and without adjustment for baseline variables. RESULTS: The unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) for anastrozole versus tamoxifen for TTR was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.64 to 0.87) for women with either ER+ or PgR+ tumors. In the ER+/PgR+ subgroup (n = 3,834) the HR was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.69 to 1.02) compared with 0.43 (95% CI, 0.31 to 0.61) in the ER+/PgR-negative (PgR-) subgroup (n = 880). In the adjusted model the HRs were 0.83 and 0.45, respectively. CONCLUSION: Time to recurrence was longer for anastrozole- than tamoxifen-treated patients in both ER+/PgR+ and ER+/PgR- subgroups, but the benefit was substantially greater in the PgR- subgroup. As this was an ""exploratory"" analysis, this effect should be considered as hypothesis generating and assessed prospectively in other trials comparing the adjuvant use of an aromatase inhibitor with tamoxifen.",0
Comparison of short-term and continuous chemotherapy (mitozantrone) for advanced breast cancer.,"132 patients with advanced recurrent breast cancer were treated with four courses of mitozantrone 14 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks (9 weeks). Patients showing disease stabilisation or objective response were randomised to stop chemotherapy or to continue until disease progression. At that stage 27% showed partial responses, 3% complete responses, and 10% disease stabilisation. 22 patients were randomised to continue chemotherapy and 21 to stop. There was no difference in time to disease progression, response duration, or survival between the two groups. Toxicity was mild during the first four courses of therapy. Thus, short courses of single-agent chemotherapy can produce similar therapeutic results to long-term chemotherapy, which has major implications for cost, resource allocation, and toxicity of therapy. Stopping chemotherapy early in responders did not cause rapid relapse. Since drug resistance apparently develops early during therapy, new approaches to modify resistance should be more useful than continuous chemotherapy.",1
Radiotherapy and tamoxifen after mastectomy in postmenopausal women -- 20 year follow-up of the South Sweden Breast Cancer Group randomised trial SSBCG II:I.,"AIMS: To evaluate long-term effects of radiotherapy and tamoxifen after mastectomy on recurrence and survival in stage II breast cancer. METHODS: A randomised phase III study with three treatment alternatives. (1) Radiotherapy 50 Gy/25 fractions to chest wall and regional lymph nodes (RT). (2) Radiotherapy and tamoxifen 30 mg/day for one year (RT+tam) and 3. Tamoxifen (tam). RESULTS: 724 postmenopausal women were included between 1978 and 1985 and the trial was close to population based. Follow-up for survival was 23 years. Locoregional recurrences were reduced from 18.5% in the tam arm to 5.3% in the RT+tam arm. Overall mortality at 20 years was 71% in the RT arm, 68% in the RT+tam arm and 62% in the tam arm. The difference between RT+tam and tam was not significant except in the receptor positive subgroup in favour of non-irradiated patients (p=0.047). The cumulative incidence of systemic disease at 20 years was lower in the RT+Tam arm than in the RT arm, 40% versus 50% (p=0.047). CONCLUSION: Postmastectomy radiotherapy significantly reduced loco-regional recurrences, but overall survival was not improved. At 20 years, a lower mortality was recorded for non-irradiated patients treated with tam.",0
p53 immunohistochemical staining and survival after adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.,"We have investigated the relationship between immunohistochemically determined p53 status and outcome in 277 women with node-positive primary breast cancer who, following tumour excision and axillary clearance, were randomised to receive either 6 cycles of cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/S-fluorouracil (CMF) (n = 130) or no such post-operative treatment (n = 147). Follow-up data (median = 9 years) were available on all patients. A significant association was found between p53 status and survival. Patients with p53-positive tumours had a less favourable outcome than those with p53-negative disease. Women receiving adjuvant CMF chemotherapy had a significantly more favourable outcome compared to those who did not. The effect was seen both in women with p53-positive and p53-negative tumours; multivariate analysis showed relative risks for overall survival attributable to chemotherapy of 2.3 (95% CI 1.2-4.3) for women with p53-positive tumours and of 2.1 (95% CI 1.4-3.0) for those with p53-negative tumours. Thus, adjuvant chemotherapy with CMF is associated with a survival benefit in women with node-positive breast cancer irrespective of immunohistochemically determined p53 status.",0
Lack of benefit of maintenance paclitaxel in first-line chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: This randomized study compared maintenance paclitaxel with control in metastatic breast cancer patients not experiencing progression after first-line anthracycline/paclitaxel combination chemotherapy. METHODS: Between April 1998 and October 2003, 459 metastatic breast cancer patients received first-line combination chemotherapy with epirubicin or doxorubicin plus paclitaxel. Of these, 255 who had a response or stable disease were then randomly assigned onto the Maintenance Paclitaxel 1 (MANTA1) study, comparing eight courses of maintenance paclitaxel versus control (ie, no additional chemotherapy administration). The primary end point was progression-free survival. RESULTS: The study was prematurely concluded after a futility analysis, which was performed on 215 of the 238 patients randomly assigned within December 2002. Of these, 109 patients were assigned to maintenance paclitaxel and 106 were assigned to stopping chemotherapy. No significant difference in median progression-free survival was observed (8.0 months for maintenance paclitaxel and 9.0 months for control). There was no significant difference in median survival time (28.0 v 29.0 months). When the Bayesian method for monitoring clinical trials was applied to these data, even under an enthusiastic prior distribution, in the posterior distribution there was only an 8.6% chance of observing a 3-month improvement in median progression-free survival in the group receiving maintenance paclitaxel. After these results study accrual was closed. CONCLUSION: Compared with control, the administration of additional courses of paclitaxel in patients who achieve disease control after six to eight courses of first-line anthracycline plus paclitaxel combination chemotherapy does not improve progression-free survival.",1
Activity of fulvestrant versus exemestane in advanced breast cancer patients with or without visceral metastases: data from the EFECT trial.,"PURPOSE: Patients with visceral metastases (VM: lung and/or liver metastases) are generally regarded as being less responsive to hormonal therapy, and chemotherapy often becomes the default treatment. This paper reports a subgroup analysis from EFECT (The Evaluation of Faslodex versus Exemestane Clinical Trial) examining the efficacy of fulvestrant and exemestane in patients with or without VM.METHODS: EFECT is a randomised, double-blind, multicentre, Phase III trial in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer progressing or recurring after prior non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor therapy.RESULTS: Overall, approximately 57% of patients in EFECT had visceral involvement. Fulvestrant and exemestane demonstrated clinical benefit in 29.1% and 27.2% of patients with VM, respectively. Median duration of response was 13.5 vs 10.8 months and median duration of clinical benefit was 9.9 vs 8.1 months, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: These results encourage the use of endocrine agents such as fulvestrant in treating patients with advanced breast cancer and VM.",0
Premenopausal breast cancer patients treated with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog alone or in combination with an aromatase inhibitor: a comparative endocrine study.,"BACKGROUND: The combination of a GnRH analogue and an aromatase inhibitor can induce a complete estrogen blockade in premenopausal breast cancer patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-one premenopausal women with advanced breast cancer were randomised to receive the GnRH analog triptorelin (3.75 mg i.m. monthly; n = 10) alone or in combination with the aromatase inhibitor formestane (4-OHA, 500 mg i.m. fortnightly; n = 11) to compare the effect of both treatments on the patients' estrogenic milieu. Therefore, serum estrogen, gonadotropin and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels were investigated before the start of treatment and subsequently over a three-month period. RESULTS: There was a significant between-group difference in estrogen suppression during therapy. In comparison with baseline values, after four weeks of treatment the estradiol levels decreased by an average of 86.9% (95% CI, 70.5-94.2%) in the group treated with triptorelin alone and by 97.3% (95% CI, 94.1-98.8%; P = 0.0422) in the combination group; the respective figures for estrone were 48.5% (95% CI, 27.5-63.5%) and 70.4% (95% CI, 52.3-81.6%; P = 0.0007) and for estrone sulfate 56.7% (95% CI, 40-68.8%) and 80.5% (95% CI, 69.4-87.6%; P = 0.0055). No difference was observed between the groups in terms of gonadotropin suppression; both treatment modalities led to a slight but delayed decrease in SHBG levels. Three of the patients treated with triptorelin alone experienced tumor regression compared with four patients in the combination group. No appreciable side effects of the combination therapy were observed. CONCLUSION: The treatment of premenopausal patients with triptorelin plus 4-OHA is feasible and leads to a much greater inhibition of main circulating estrogens than treatment with the analog alone. Since the combination of a GnRH analog and an aromatase inhibitor might potentially enhance the anti-tumor efficacy of the analog alone owing to more favorable endocrine effects, such a therapeutic approach deserves more extensive evaluation in the clinical setting.",0

Topoisomerase II alpha protein and responsiveness of breast cancer to adjuvant chemotherapy with CEF compared to CMF in the NCIC CTG randomized MA.5 adjuvant trial.,"Overexpression of topoisomerase II protein (topo 2α) is postulated to be more closely associated with responsiveness to anthracycline-containing chemotherapy than human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) gene amplification or alterations in the topoisomerase II alpha gene (TOP2A). The authors used tissue microarrays from 477 of 710 premenopausal women with node-positive breast cancer randomized to CEF or CMF adjuvant chemotherapy in the NCIC Clinical Trials Group Mammary 5 (MA.5) trial. No significant interaction was found between treatment and continuous topo 2α level in either relapse-free (RFS) or overall survival (OS). In 136 patients (28.5%) whose tumors showed topo 2α overexpression by immunohistochemistry based on a cut-off of 13%, CEF was superior to CMF for RFS (adjusted HR 0.45; 95% CI 0.25-0.82; P = 0.009) and OS (adjusted HR 0.50; 95% CI 0.26-0.96; P = 0.04). When tumors lacked topo 2α overexpression, CEF was not superior for RFS (adjusted HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.64-1.22; P = 0.46) or OS (adjusted HR 0.95; 95% CI 0.66-1.38; P = 0.80). Interaction between topo 2α and treatment was borderline significant for RFS (P = 0.04) and OS (P = 0.05) and not substantially more significant than between TOP2A gene alteration (P (interaction) = 0.09 for RFS and 0.02 for OS) or HER2 overexpression (P (interaction) = 0.002 for RFS and 0.009 for OS). Topo 2α protein overexpression based on the cut-off identified in this study, TOP2A gene alterations and HER2 protein overexpression were each associated with responsiveness to anthracycline-containing chemotherapy. The topo 2α protein analysis was exploratory and will require further validation.",0
Prospective multicenter trial to determine the feasibility of collection and predictive ability of breast fluid analysis in postmenopausal women receiving SERMs.,"We conducted a prospective ancillary study to the study of tamoxifen and raloxifene (STAR) trial involving 4 institutions to determine: (1) our ability to collect nipple aspirate fluid (NAF) in postmenopausal women taking medication to decrease breast proliferation and (2) NAF biomarkers associated with breast cancer. NAF was collected before and 6 months after starting treatment. Three biomarkers, cytology, fluid volume, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), were analyzed. NAF was collected from 26 of 33 (79%) enrolled subjects at baseline. We were able to collect fluid in 84% of the subjects who produced NAF at baseline and returned for second aspiration after 6 months of treatment. In these women, cytology was unchanged in 85%, improved in 11%, and worsened in 4% of breasts. Median PSA increased from 37.5 to 112 ng/L after treatment. NAF volume did not significantly change. In conclusion, after treatment with tamoxifen or raloxifene, changes in both NAF cytology and PSA were generally favorable, consistent with their expected antiproliferative effective effect on the breast. Multiinstitutional clinical trials in postmenopausal women using NAF biomarkers as the primary endpoints are feasible.",0
Postmenopausal patients with node-positive resectable breast cancer. Tamoxifen vs FEC 50 (6 cycles) vs FEC 50 (6 cycles) plus tamoxifen vs control--preliminary results of a 4-arm randomised trial. The French Adjuvant Study Group.,"In 1986 the true benefit of adjuvant medical treatment in postmenopausal patients with pathological node-positive breast adenocarcinoma was still controversial. The French Adjuvant Study Group (FASG) initiated a randomised trial to elucidate the respective roles of adjuvant chemo-and/or hormonotherapy in this group of patients. Of the 776 patients who have been included between 1986 and 1990, 741 were fully eligible for evaluation. Inclusion criteria were postmenopausal patients aged between 50 and 70 years with adenocarcinoma of the breast, positive pathological nodes and no distant metastasis. Patients were randomised to 1 of 4 treatment arms: Group A (n = 192) received tamoxifen 30 mg/day orally for 3 years; Group B (n = 183) received FEC 50 (fluorouracil 500 mg/m2, epirubicin 50 mg/m2 plus cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2) for 6 cycles; Group C (n = 182) received tamoxifen 30 mg/day orally for 3 years plus FEC 50 for 6 cycles; Group D (n = 184) received no medical adjuvant treatment. Surgery was either modified radical mastectomy (n = 363) or tumorectomy (n = 378), and postoperative irradiation was given to all patients. All major prognostic factors were well balanced between the 4 patient groups. Toxicity was evaluated in 348 patients in Groups B and C who received a total of 1983 chemotherapy cycles. Median epirubicin dose intensity (mg/m2/week) was 15.8 in Group B and 15.7 in Group C. Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia was observed in 4.7% of cycles for Group B and 3.7% for Group C. Grade 3 to 4 nausea/vomiting were seen in 18% of treatment cycles in Group B and 15% in Group C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1
"Evaluation of a mobile phone-based, advanced symptom management system (ASyMS) in the management of chemotherapy-related toxicity.","OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of a mobile phone-based, remote monitoring, advanced symptom management system (ASyMS) on the incidence, severity and distress of six chemotherapy-related symptoms (nausea, vomiting, fatigue, mucositis, hand-foot syndrome and diarrhoea) in patients with lung, breast or colorectal cancer. DESIGN: A two group (intervention and control) by five time points (baseline, pre-cycle 2, pre-cycle 3, pre-cycle 4 and pre-cycle 5) randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Seven clinical sites in the UK; five specialist cancer centres and two local district hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and twelve people with breast, lung or colorectal cancer receiving outpatient chemotherapy. INTERVENTIONS: A mobile phone-based, remote monitoring, advanced symptom management system (ASyMS). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Chemotherapy-related morbidity of six common chemotherapy-related symptoms (nausea, vomiting, fatigue, mucositis, hand-foot syndrome and diarrhoea). RESULTS: There were significantly higher reports of fatigue in the control group compared to the intervention group (odds ratio = 2.29, 95%CI = 1.04 to 5.05, P = 0.040) and reports of hand-foot syndrome were on average lower in the control group (odds ratio control/intervention = 0.39, 95%CI = 0.17 to 0.92, P = 0.031). CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates that ASyMS can support the management of symptoms in patients with lung, breast and colorectal cancer receiving chemotherapy.",0

Biomarker alterations with metronomic use of low-dose zoledronic acid for breast cancer patients with bone metastases and potential clinical significance.,"Zoledronic acid has direct and indirect antitumor effects. However, the optimal regimen for breast cancer patients remains to be determined. This study aimed to compare biomarker changes between a weekly low dose (metronomic arm) and a conventional dosage of zoledronic acid (conventional arm), and to explore correlations between biomarkers and progression-free survival (PFS). Sixty breast cancer patients with bone metastases were randomized to receive either zoledronic acid 1 mg IV weekly for 4 doses or a single dose of zoledronic acid 4 mg IV. Administration of other treatments was delayed for 1 month. Serial blood samples were collected on days 1, 15, 29, and at 3 months. Serum VEGF alteration was the primary endpoint. Compared to the conventional arm, the metronomic arm resulted in a significantly greater reduction in serum levels of VEGF and N-telopeptide of type I collagen (NTx) over time during the first month of treatment. Serum CA 15-3 level stabilized over time in the metronomic arm, but increased in the conventional arm. Independent prognostic factors for PFS included chemotherapy received (HR, 8.042; P = 0.000), estrogen receptor status (HR, 2.837; P = 0.020), VEGF levels at 3 months after intervention (HR, 2.026; P = 0.045), and baseline NTx (HR, 1.051; P = 0.001). Metronomic low-dose zoledronic acid is more effective than the conventional regimen and generates sustained reductions in circulating VEGF and NTx levels, as well as stabilization of serum CA 15-3 levels (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00524849).",0

Breast tumour response to primary chemotherapy predicts local and distant control as well as survival.,"The purpose of the present paper was to evaluate correlations between clinical response to chemotherapy and outcome in a subgroup analysis of premenopausal patients with tumours considered too large for breast conserving surgery, treated with primary chemotherapy (n = 200) from a previously published trial (Scholl S.M., Fourquet A., Asselain B, et al. Eur J Cancer 1994, 30A, 645-652). Objective response rates amounted to 65% following four courses. In a multivariate Cox regression analysis, comparing seven parameters, the following variables were associated with poor survival: clinically involved nodes [N1b:RR: 2.7 (95% CI 1.3-5.3)], the failure to respond to chemotherapy [D:RR: 2.62 (95% CI 1.3-5)] and a raised S phase fraction [SPF > 5%: RR: 2.4 (95% CI 1.2-5)]. Parameters associated with increased metastatic recurrence rates, by order of entry in the model, were: young age [< 35: RR: 2.46 (95% CI 1.2-5)], large clinical tumour size [T3: RR: 2.02 (95% CI 1.2-3.4)], poor histological grade (SBR III: RR: 1.93 (95% CI 1.1-3.3)] and the failure to respond to chemotherapy [D: RR: 1.91 (95% CI 1-3.4)]. The assessment of both tumour cell proliferation rates as well as possibly drug resistance markers (although not available in the present study) should be helpful in selecting patients likely to benefit from intensified chemotherapy regimens. The most accurate predictor of response in the present study appeared to be the response to chemotherapy treatment itself.",0
Ex vivo expanded peripheral blood progenitor cells provide rapid neutrophil recovery after high-dose chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer.,"Ex vivo expanded peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) have been proposed as a source of hematopoietic support to decrease or eliminate the period of neutropenia after high-dose chemotherapy. CD34 cells were selected from rhG-CSF mobilized PBPCs from patients with breast cancer and were cultured for 10 days in defined media containing 100 ng/mL each of rhSCF, rhG-CSF, and PEG-rhMGDF in 1 L Teflon bags at 20 000 cells/mL. After culture the cells were washed and reinfused on day 0 of transplantation. On day +1, cohort 1 patients (n = 10) also received an unexpanded CD34-selected PBPC product. These patients engrafted neutrophils (absolute neutrophil count, >500/microL) in a median of 6 (range, 5-14) days. Cohort 2 patients (n = 11), who received expanded PBPCs only, engrafted neutrophils in a median of 8 (range, 4-16) days. In comparison, the median time to neutrophil engraftment in a historical control group of patients (n = 100) was 9 days (range, 7-30 days). All surviving patients are now past the 15-month posttransplantation stage with no evidence of late graft failure. The total number of nucleated cells harvested after expansion culture was shown to be the best predictor of time to neutrophil engraftment, with all patients receiving more than 4 x 10(7) cells/kg, engrafting neutrophils by day 8. No significant effect on platelet recovery was observed in any patient. These data demonstrate that PBPCs expanded under the conditions defined can shorten the time to engraftment of neutrophils compared with historical controls and that the rate of engraftment is related to the dose of expanded cells transplanted.",0
"Pamidronate prevents skeletal complications and is effective palliative treatment in women with breast carcinoma and osteolytic bone metastases: long term follow-up of two randomized, placebo-controlled trials.","BACKGROUND: Pamidronate therapy previously has been shown to reduce skeletal complications effectively for up to 12 months in breast carcinoma patients with bone metastases. The current study data provide further follow-up results regarding the effects of long term (up to 24 months) pamidronate treatment in women with breast carcinoma and osteolytic metastases. METHODS: Follow-up results from two prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention trials conducted at academic and community oncology centers were combined to provide a large data set with which to evaluate the long term efficacy and safety of pamidronate therapy. Seven hundred fifty-four women with Stage IV breast carcinoma and osteolytic metastases were randomized to the 2 treatment arms of the trial. Three patients were excluded from the intent-to-treat population for the analysis. A total of 751 evaluable patients were randomized to receive either a 90-mg intravenous pamidronate infusion (367 patients) or a placebo infusion (384 patients) every 3-4 weeks. The primary outcome measures were skeletal morbidity rate (events/year), proportion of patients developing a skeletal complication, and time to first skeletal complication. RESULTS: Of the 367 women receiving pamidronate, 115 (31.3%) completed the trial and 81 (22.1%) discontinued the study due to adverse events. Of the 384 women who received placebo, 100 (26.0%) completed the study and 76 (19.8%) discontinued the study due to adverse events. The skeletal morbidity rate was 2.4 in the pamidronate group and 3.7 in the placebo group (P < 0.001). In the pamidronate group, 186 of the 367 patients (51%) had skeletal complications compared with 246 of the 384 patients in the placebo group (64%) (P < 0.001). The median time to first skeletal complication was 12.7 months in the pamidronate group and 7 months in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Six patients treated with pamidronate discontinued treatment due to drug-related adverse events. Pain and analgesic scores were significantly worse in the placebo group compared with those patients in the pamidronate group. CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, monthly infusions of 90 mg of pamidronate as a supplement to antineoplastic therapy were found to be well tolerated and superior to antineoplastic therapy alone in preventing skeletal complications and palliating symptoms for at least 24 months in breast carcinoma patients with osteolytic bone metastases.",0

Conservative treatment vs. mastectomy without radiotherapy in aged women with breast cancer--a prospective and randomized trial.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether tumorectomy with tamoxifen in women over 70 years achieves the same treatment results as mastectomy plus tamoxifen. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective randomized analysis of 121 patients over 70 with breast cancer clinically negative axilla and tumor up to 4 cm diameter. Randomization was according to even or odd birth month. Branch A: Madden operation + tamoxifen 20 mg OD (once/day). Branch B: Tumorectomy to disease free margins + tamoxifen 20 mg OD. RESULTS: Survival rate of five years for the Madden operation was 69% and for tumorectomy 71.4% with a mortality from other causes of 23.1%. Survival probability (specific death) at 5 years was of 93.4% for the Madden group and 95.2% for tumorectomy. A significant increase of the mortality was observed in those patients that had recurrences, no matter of treatment given. Specific death cause did not vary with age, but did for other causes, this being significant. CONCLUSIONS: Tumorectomy plus tamoxifen demonstrated to be as effective as Madden Op. plus tamoxifen in women over 70 years with T1-T2-N0 disease.",0
Is transdermal nitroglycerin application effective in preventing and healing flap ischaemia after modified radical mastectomy?,"OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the efficacy of local nitroglycerin application in preventing and treating flap complications after modified radical mastectomy in a large patient cohort.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1993 and 2008, 6426 patients undergoing surgery for stage II breast cancer were enrolled in this prospective study. Patients were randomised into treatment and control groups. In the treatment group a nitroglycerin preparation (Nitroderm) was applied to the flap area. Major complications, recovery periods, menopausal status, additional diseases (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atherosclerotic heart disease) and adverse effects related to nitroglycerin use were recorded.RESULTS: The recovery rate without major complications was statistically significantly higher in the nitroglycerin-treated group than in the controls (p < 0.001).CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that topical nitroglycerin reduces flap complications after breast surgery.",0
"Gemcitabine, epirubicin and paclitaxel: pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions in advanced breast cancer.","BACKGROUND: The objectives of this study were to investigate the disposition of gemcitabine, epirubicin, paclitaxel, 2',2'-difluorodeoxyuridine and epirubicinol, and characterize the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of treatment in patients with breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The drug dispostion in 15 patients who received gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2, epirubicin 90 mg/m2 and paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 (GEP) on day 1 of a 21-day cycle, was compared with that of patients treated with epirubicin 90 mg/m2 and paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 (EP, n = 6) and epirubicin 90 mg/m2 alone (n = 6). Drug and metabolite levels in plasma and urine were assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography and parameters of drug exposure were related to hematological toxicity by a sigmoid-maximum effect (Emax) model. RESULTS: Paclitaxel administration significantly increased the epirubicinol area under the concentration-time curve, from 357+/-146 (epirubicin) to 603+/-107 (EP) and 640+/-81 h x ng/ml (GEP), and reduced the renal clearance of epirubicin and epirubicinol by 38 and 52.2% and 34.5 and 53% in GEP- and EP-treated patients, respectively, compared with epirubicin alone. Gemcitabine had no apparent effect on paclitaxel and epirubicin pharmacokinetics, and renal clearance of epirubicin and epirubicinol. The only pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship observed was between neutropenia and the time spent above the threshold plasma level of 0.1 micromol/l (tC0.1) of paclitaxel, with the time required to obtain a 50% decrease in neutrophil count (Et50) of GEP being 7.8 h, similar to that of EP. CONCLUSIONS: Paclitaxel and/or its vehicle, Cremophor EL, interferes with the disposition and renal excretion of epirubicin and epirubicinol; gemcitabine has no affect on epirubicin and paclitaxel plasma pharmacokinetics and renal excretion of epirubicin, while neutropenia is not enhanced by gemcitabine.",1
Management of the axilla in operable breast cancer treated by breast conservation: a randomized clinical trial. Edinburgh Breast Unit.,"BACKGROUND: In the treatment of operable breast cancer by breast conservation, the extent of axillary dissection, the need for radiotherapy to the axilla and the morbidity associated with these procedures have not been assessed adequately. METHODS: Patients with operable breast cancer were randomized to have level III axillary node clearance (232 patients) or axillary node sample (234 patients). Radiotherapy to the axilla was given selectively. Radiotherapy was not given to those who had an axillary clearance. In the early part of the study all patients who had node sample were treated by radiotherapy (54 patients); subsequently this was modified to include only those who were node positive. The morbidity to the shoulder and arm was assessed before and after operation by measuring upper limb volume and circumference, and combined glenohumeral and scapular movement and muscle power. RESULTS: Comparing the two surgical policies, no difference was found in local (axillary clearance 14 versus sample 15), axillary (eight versus seven) or distant (29 versus 29) recurrence. There was no statistically significant difference in 5-year survival rate (clearance 82.1 versus sample 88.6 per cent). Morbidity was least in those who had a node sample and no radiotherapy to the axilla. Radiotherapy to the axilla in patients who had a node sample resulted in a significant reduction in range of movement of the shoulder, e.g. mean(s.e.) 2.2(0.6) cm reduction in lateral rotation at 3 years. Surgical axillary clearance was associated with significant lymphoedema of the upper limb, e.g. 4.1(0.7) per cent increase in arm volume at 3 years. CONCLUSION: A selective policy for the management of the axilla is associated with no increase in axillary recurrence or mortality rate compared with routine axillary node clearance. Patients who are node negative after axillary sample can avoid radiotherapy or axillary clearance.",0
Immunohistochemistry compared to cytosol assays for determination of estrogen receptor and prediction of the long-term effect of adjuvant tamoxifen.,"The purpose of this study is to compare immunohistochemistry (IHC) and cytosol-based assays for determination of estrogen receptor (ER) and prediction of response to adjuvant tamoxifen treatment in postmenopausal women with early-stage invasive breast cancer. The Stockholm Breast Cancer Study Group conducted a randomized trial during 1976 through 1990 comparing adjuvant tamoxifen versus control. The patients were stratified according to tumor size and lymph node status in high-risk and low-risk groups. In this study we evaluated 683 patients with ""low risk"" breast cancer (size ≤30 mm, lymph node-negative) for whom ER status had been determined by both the cytosol assays and IHC at one pathology laboratory. The median follow-up was 17 years. Six hundred eighty-three patients had tumors with ER determined by both methods, 536 (78.5%) were ER-positive by cytosol assays using the cutoff level at ≥0.05 fmol/μg DNA and 539 patients were ER-positive (79%) by IHC using the cutoff level at ≥10% cell stained. Thirty-nine tumors (5.7%) were ER-positive by cytosol but not by IHC, whereas the opposite pattern was found for 42 cases (6.1%). Only seven tumors had stained cells between 0 and 9% by IHC. The concordance between IHC and cytosol assays was high (88%). The kappa statistic was 0.65, 95% CI 0.58-0.72. Among patients classified as ER-negative no therapeutic benefit from tamoxifen was observed. Among patients with ER-expressing tumors, tamoxifen resulted in significantly better recurrence-free survival irrespective of the method (IHC: HR, 0.53, P < 0.001; cytosol: HR, 0.53, P < 0.001). The effect on overall survival was not statistically significant probably due to the limited sample size. Both IHC and cytosol assay accurately predict long-term response to adjuvant tamoxifen.",0
Effect of megestrol acetate on quality of life in a dose-response trial in women with advanced breast cancer. The Cancer and Leukemia Group B.,"PURPOSE: The impact of the side effects of megestrol acetate on the quality of life of noncachectic women with advanced breast cancer was studied in a dose-response clinical trial of the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB 8741). Side effects of appetite increase and weight gain at higher doses were predicted to have a negative effect on quality of life. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Stage IV breast cancer patients were randomized to receive either 160, 800, or 1,600 mg/d of megestrol acetate. Quality of life was assessed in 131 patients at trial entry and at 1 and 3 months while on treatment, by telephone interview, using the following measures: the Functional Living Index-Cancer (FLIC), Rand Functional Limitations Scale, Rand Mental Health Inventory (MHI), the Body Image Subscale, and linear analog scales of drug side effects. RESULTS: At 3 months, women treated with 160 mg/d reported less severe side effects (P < .0005), better physical functioning (FLS, P < .0005), less psychologic distress (MHI, P = .008), and an improvement in overall quality of life (FLIC, P = .003) from the time of study entry as compared with those treated with 1,600 mg/d. Patients who received the 800-mg/d dose fell between the low- and high-dose arms in reported intensity of drug side effects, but responded similarly to those in the 160-mg/d group in terms of physical functioning, psychologic distress, and overall quality of life. CONCLUSION: Unless additional follow-up data demonstrate a survival advantage at higher doses, the 160-mg/d dose is optimal, achieving maximal treatment effect with the fewest side effects and better quality of life.",0
Survival analyses from the ZEBRA study. goserelin (Zoladex) versus CMF in premenopausal women with node-positive breast cancer.,"The Zoladex Early Breast Cancer Research Association (ZEBRA) trial compared the efficacy and tolerability of goserelin (Zoladex) with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) chemotherapy in pre-/perimenopausal women with node-positive early breast cancer. The results of disease-free survival (DFS) analyses have already been published. Here we present an update including data on overall survival (OS) from the ZEBRA trial at a median follow-up of 7.3 years. In patients with oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumours, non-inferiority of goserelin versus CMF for OS was shown; goserelin was again shown to be equivalent to CMF for DFS. This updated analysis has demonstrated that the two treatments are also equivalent for distant disease-free survival (DDFS). In patients with ER-negative disease, goserelin was inferior to CMF for DFS, DDFS and OS. This follow-up analysis confirms the previously reported outcomes from the ZEBRA trial and demonstrates that goserelin offers an effective alternative to CMF chemotherapy for adjuvant therapy of premenopausal patients with ER-positive, node-positive early breast cancer.",0
A randomised phase II study of conventional versus accelerated infusional chemotherapy with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support in advanced breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) allows cycles of conventional bolus chemotherapy to be accelerated with reduction in treatment time and a boost in dose intensity. Theoretically, this approach could be hazardous with infusional 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) chemotherapy, since G-CSF-stimulated neutrophil proliferation would be occurring in the face of continuous S-phase active 5-FU. We performed this phase II randomised study to compare the safety, tolerability and efficacy of conventional 3-weekly epirubicin, cyclophosphamide and continuous infusional 5-FU (infusional ECF) to an accelerated 2-weekly schedule with G-CSF support, in patients with advanced breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven patients were randomised. with 14 in the accelerated arm. Patients received bolus epirubicin 60 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 every 3 weeks (conventional arm) or every 2 weeks (accelerated arm) and 5-FU 200 mg/m2/day continuous infusion throughout. G-CSF 300 microg/day s.c. on days 10-12 was given each accelerated cycle. RESULTS: There were no treatment delays secondary to inadequate neutrophil or platelet recovery in either arm, with higher median day 1 neutrophil counts for each cycle in the accelerated arm compared with the conventional arm. Eighty-six per cent of the planned conventional chemotherapy cycles and 82% of the planned accelerated cycles were given. There were no major differences in toxicity between the arms, with the most common grade 3 toxicities being alopecia and stomatitis. Eight patients developed neutropenic sepsis (five in the accelerated arm and three in the conventional arm). Ten patients (77%) responded in the conventional arm and nine (64%) in the accelerated arm. CONCLUSIONS: Accelerated infusional ECF with limited G-CSF support is a feasible and well-tolerated regimen with rapid haematological recovery. A 50% increase in relative dose intensity of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide is achieved, while overall treatment time is reduced by 33%.",1
"UFT and mitomycin plus tamoxifen for stage II, ER-positive breast cancer. Hokkaido ACETBC Study Group.","A trial was designed to examine the combination of UFT and mitomycin (Mutamycin) plus tamoxifen (Nolvadex) as postoperative adjuvant therapy in the treatment of patients with stage II, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive primary breast cancer. Mitomycin was administered intravenously at 13 mg/m2 on the day of surgery. Patients judged to be ER-positive were randomly allocated to either group A, which received oral tamoxifen 20 mg/day 14 days after surgery for 2 years, or group B, receiving oral UFT 400 mg/day plus tamoxifen 20 mg/day. A total of 219 patients were enrolled in group A, of which 213 (97.3%) were determined to be eligible; 225 patients enrolled in group B and 223 (99.1%) were eligible. The 5-year survival rates were 93.0% for group A and 95.4% for group B, with no significant difference between groups. The 5-year relapse-free survival rates were 83.1% for group A and 90.7% for group B, a significant advantage (P = .020) for the UFT plus tamoxifen group. Combination therapy with mitomycin, tamoxifen, and UFT proved to be an effective postoperative chemoendocrine therapy for stage II, ER-positive breast cancer.",1
Evaluation of paclitaxel in adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with operable breast cancer: preliminary data of a prospective randomized trial.,"PURPOSE: Paclitaxel has significant antitumor activity in patients with metastaticbreast cancer who have been previously treated with or exposed to anthracycline-containing chemotherapy. In this prospective randomized trial, the role of paclitaxel was evaluated in an adjuvant setting to determine its impact on reducing the risk of recurrence in patients with operable breast cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Five hundred twenty-four patients were randomized to be treated either with 4 cycles of paclitaxel followed by 4 cycles of combination therapy with 5-fluorouracil, Adriamycin, and cyclophosphamide (Pac/FAC) or with 8 cycles of FAC alone. Patients with intact primary breast cancer received the initial 4 cycles of paclitaxel or 4 cycles of FAC in a neoadjuvant setting. Planned duration of therapy was the same in all patients. After completion of 8 cycles of chemotherapy, those patients who were > or =50 years and whose tumors were positive for estrogen receptors received tamoxifen for 5 years. RESULTS: Ninety-two patients have had a recurrence after a median follow-up of 60 months with a range of 5-89 months. Estimated disease-free survival at 48 months was 0.83 for FAC and 0.86 for Pac/FAC group. The difference between the two groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.09). The overall estimated hazard ratio for Pac/FAC compared with FAC derived by fitting the Cox regression model and incorporating terms for prognostic factors was 0.66. CONCLUSION: Preliminary results suggest that the addition of paclitaxel to a FAC regimen of adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy may further reduce the risk of disease recurrence; however, differences were not statistically significant. At the time of this analysis, there have been 47 deaths. The survival data are too preliminary to permit meaningful evaluation of the impact of paclitaxel on mortality.",1
Ten year follow-up results of patients with carcinoma of the breast in a co-operative clinical trial evaluating surgical adjuvant chemotherapy.,"In 1958, a co-operative clinical trial, involving 23 institutions, was begun to evaluate the efficacy of a short course of triethylenethiophosphoramide as an adjuvant to radical mastectomy in the treatment of patients with primary carcinoma of the breast. Of 826 women prospectively randomized so that they received either a placebo or triethylenethiophosphoramide, 99.3 per cent were available for five years of follow-up study, and 95.3 per cent have been observed for ten or more years. Results have indicated the inadequacy of standard operative therapy in effecting a permanent tumor-free state in a majority of patients. Particularly distressing was the finding that 76 per cent of all patients with positive axillary nodes--65 per cent with one to three and 86 per cent of those with more than or equal to four positive--demonstrated a treatment failure by ten years and that only 24.9 per cent survived. The survival rate of those with one to three positive nodes was 37.5 per cent and only 13.4 per cent if more than or equal to four nodes contained tumor. Also disturbing was the observation that one of four patients with negative axillary nodes displayed a treatment failure by ten years. Such findings mandate the urgency for immediate evaluation of available systemic therapeutic agents postoperatively. That systemic chemotherapy can enhance the disease-free state as well as survival rate of at least some patients with carcinoma of the breast is supported by the finding that the original observation at 18 months indicating an advantage for premenopausal women with more than or equal to four positive nodes who received triethylenethiophosphoramide persisted for as long as ten years. At that time, 21 per cent fewer patients in the triethylenethiophosphoramide group had treatment failures and 21 per cent more survived, an indication that the initial delay in treatment failure was reflected in patient survival rate. Data suggesting that the limited chemotherapy used was more effective in patients having smaller tumors are in keeping with the concept that adjuvant therapy is likely to be most effective in a host with minimal residual tumor burden. Of importance was the observation that 80 per cent of treatment failures occurring in ten years were apparent by five years of observation. Strikingly, 86 per cent of ten year treatment failures in patients with positive nodes occurred by five years. In patients with more than or equal to four positive nodes, this was so in 92 per cent of the instances. Such findings tend to discredit the claim that the worth of an alternative treatment for carcinoma of the breast can be ascertained only by a period of observation much longer than five years.",0
Phase II study of weekly docetaxel alone or in combination with trastuzumab in patients with metastatic breast cancer.,"This study was designed to determine the efficacy and toxicity of weekly docetaxel in metastatic breast cancer when given alone (for HER2/neu negative disease) or with trastuzumab (for HER2/neu overexpressing disease). Patients with metastatic breast carcinoma received docetaxel given on 2 different schedules (group 1A, 33 mg/m2 weekly [n = 21]; group 1B, 40 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks with 1 week off [n = 14]). Patients with HER2/neu overexpressing disease also received trastuzumab 4 mg/kg on day 1, then 2 mg/kg on days 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle (group 2). Fifty-two patients were treated with docetaxel alone (group 1A/B, n = 35) or in combination with trastuzumab (group 2, n = 17). Prior taxane therapy given every 3 weeks had been used for metastatic disease in 19 of 35 patients (54%) in group 1A/B and in 2 of 17 patients (12%) in group 2. The mean delivered dose intensity of docetaxel was 29 mg/m2 per week. Partial response occurred in 7 of 35 patients (21%; 95% exact binomial confidence interval [CI], 9%-38%) treated with docetaxel alone, including 3 of 19 taxane-pretreated patients (16%) and 4 of 16 taxane-naive patients (25%). Partial response occurred in 10 of 17 patients (59%; 95% CI, 34%-82%) treated with docetaxel/trastuzumab. The most common grade 3/4 toxicities, occurring in more than or equal to 10% of patients, included neutropenia (21%), pulmonary toxicity (12%), and hyperglycemia (10%). The median times to disease progression were 4.5 months (95% CI, 2.5-6.5 months) in the docetaxel group and 8.5 months (95% CI, 4.5-12.5 months) in the docetaxel/trastuzumab group. Weekly docetaxel/trastuzumab is an effective regimen for patients with HER2/neu overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. Weekly docetaxel may be effective in as many as 20% of patients who had progressive disease after treatment with taxanes given every 3 weeks.",1
Value of estrogenic recruitment before chemotherapy: first randomized trial in primary breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: Several preclinical studies showed that short-term pretreatment of breast cancer cells with estrogens can increase the antitumor efficacy of different cytotoxic drugs. Some early clinical studies in patients with advanced breast cancer did seem to support these findings. Therefore, the efficacy of estrogenic recruitment followed by chemotherapy was compared with that of chemotherapy alone in a randomized phase III study in women with lymph node-positive primary breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred twenty-eight patients with stage II/IIIA breast cancer who were younger than 66 years of age were randomly allocated to chemotherapy with fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) or FAC plus pretreatment with ethinyl estradiol (EE(2)). FAC (500, 50, and 500 mg/m(2), respectively) was administered intravenously once every 4 weeks for four cycles. EE(2) (0.5 mg) was administered orally, both 24 hours and immediately preceding FAC chemotherapy. RESULTS: Patient and tumor characteristics and chemotherapy dosages were comparable in both treatment groups. Of 318 assessable patients, with a median follow-up of 6.8 years, 177 patients had a relapse and 127 died. No significant differences were observed between the two treatment groups with respect to relapse-free, local recurrence-free, and overall survival according to univariate and multivariate analyses adjusted for age, menopausal status, tumor size, grade, number of positive nodes, and steroid-receptor status. The power for the detection of an increase of 50% in the median relapse-free survival was 80%. CONCLUSION: Estrogenic recruitment of breast cancer cells before FAC chemotherapy did not influence the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy in stage II/IIIA breast cancer patients after a follow-up of 6.8 years.",0
Elevated serum Her-2/neu level predicts decreased response to hormone therapy in metastatic breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: To determine the effect of elevation of serum HER-2/neu on response to hormone therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seven hundred nineteen metastatic patients with estrogen receptor-positive (ER(+)), progesterone receptor-positive, or both or ER status unknown breast cancer were randomized in three independent clinical trials to receive second-line hormone therapy with either megestrol acetate or an aromatase inhibitor (fadrozole or letrozole). An automated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay specific for the extracellular domain of the HER-2/neu (c-erbB-2) oncoprotein product was used to detect serum levels. RESULTS: Two hundred nineteen patients (30%) had elevated serum HER-2/neu protein levels, using the mean + 2 SD (15 ng/mL) from the serum of healthy women as an upper limit. Response to treatment was available for 711 patients. The response rate (complete responses plus partial responses plus stable disease) to endocrine therapy was 45% in 494 patients with non-elevated and 23% in 217 patients with elevated serum HER-2/neu levels (P <.0001). Median duration of treatment response (using the time to progression [TTP] variable for patients who responded) was shorter in the group with elevated serum HER-2/neu levels (11.7 months) compared with the patient group with non-elevated levels (17.4 months). TTP, time to treatment failure, and median survival (17.2 months v 29.6 months) were also significantly shorter in the patients with elevated serum HER-2/neu levels (P <.0001). CONCLUSION: Patients with ER(+) and serum HER-2/neu-positive metastatic breast cancer are less likely to respond to hormone treatment and have a shorter duration of response than ER(+) and serum HER-2/neu-negative patients. Their survival duration is also shorter.",0
Predicting survival and early clinical response to primary chemotherapy for patients with locally advanced breast cancer using DCE-MRI.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) as a tool for early prediction of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and 5-year survival in patients with locally advanced breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DCE-MRI was performed in patients scheduled for NAC (n = 24) before and after the first treatment cycle. Clinical response was evaluated after completed NAC. Relative signal intensity (RSI) and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated from the DCE-curves and compared to clinical treatment response. Kohonen and probabilistic neural network (KNN and PNN) analysis were used to predict 5-year survival. RESULTS: RSI and AUC were reduced after only one cycle of NAC in patients with clinical treatment response (P = 0.02 and P = 0.08). The mean and 10th percentile RSI values before NAC were significantly lower in patients surviving more than 5 years compared to nonsurvivors (P = 0.05 and 0.02). This relationship was confirmed using KNN, which demonstrated that patients who remained alive clustered in separate regions from those that died. Calibration of contrast enhancement curves by PNN for patient survival at 5 years yielded sensitivity and specificity for training and testing ranging from 80%-92%. CONCLUSION: DCE-MRI in locally advanced breast cancer has the potential to predict 5-year survival in a small patient cohort. In addition, changes in tumor vascularization after one cycle of NAC can be assessed.",0
Octreotide in the treatment of lymphorrhea after axillary node dissection: a prospective randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Axillary lymph node dissection for staging and local control of nodal disease is an integral part of breast cancer therapy. Lymphorrea is a serious and disabling complication of axillary lymphadenectomy, but no effective therapy is currently available. Octreotide is a hormone with general antisecretory effects that has been used to control lymphorrhea in thoracic duct injury and after radical neck dissection. The aim of the study we describe in this article was to determine whether octreotide has a role in the treatment of post axillary lymphadenectomy lymphorrhea. STUDY DESIGN: This is a prospective randomized controlled trial. Two hundred sixty-one consecutive patients with various stages of breast cancer who underwent axillary lymph node dissection were randomized and followed for 7 years. The treatment group received 0.1 mg octreotide subcutaneously three times a day for 5 days, starting on the first postoperative day, while the control group received no treatment. Of the 261 patients undergoing axillary node dissection, 136 were assigned to the control group and 125 composed the treatment group. The control group and the treatment group were evaluated for amount and duration of lymphorrhea as well as inflammatory and infectious complications. RESULTS: In the control group, the mean quantity (+/- standard deviation) of lymphorrhea was 94.6 +/- 19 cc per day and the average duration was 16.7 +/- 3.0 days. In comparison, the mean quantity of lymphorrhea in the treatment group was 65.4 +/- 21.1 cc (p < 0.0001) per day and the average duration was 7.1 +/- 2.9 days (p < 0.0001). We did not find an important difference in the number of infectious complication or hematomas formation between the study groups. CONCLUSIONS: Octreotide can be used successfully for the treatment of post-axillary dissection lymphorrea, and potentially, in the prevention of post-axillary lymph node dissection lymphosarcoma, since the amount and duration of lymphorrhea in this setting are known to be important risk factors for its development. Potentially, octreotide might be used in similar situations where lymphorrhea is detrimental, such as peripheral vascular surgery and regional lymph node dissection for melanoma.",0
"Interleukin-6, multidrug resistance protein-1 expression and response to paclitaxel in women with metastatic breast cancer: results of cancer and leukemia group B trial 159806.","Several reports have suggested that breast cancer patients with elevated serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) have a worse prognosis than patients with lower levels. We have studied IL-6 in breast cancer cell lines and have shown that autocrine production of IL-6 can confer multi-drug resistance in vitro by inducing multidrug resistance gene-1 transcription with subsequent overexpression of P-glycoprotein (PGP). Both IL-6 and PGP expression can be measured in malignant cells using immunohistochemical (IHC) techniques. We hypothesized that patients whose tumors expressed higher amounts of IL-6 or PGP would be less likely to respond to paclitaxel, an agent affected by the PGP pathway. If so, then IL-6 could serve as a predictive factor for paclitaxel sensitivity. Both IL-6 and PGP expression were measured in patients treated in a randomized trial that compared three doses of single agent paclitaxel (175, 210, and 250 mg/m(2) over 3 h every 3 weeks) in 469 women with metastatic breast cancer (CALGB 9342). No difference in complete and partial response was found among the three treatment arms. Tissue blocks in this trial were analyzed for IL-6 (154 patients) and PGP (149 patients) in paraffin-embedded sections from tumor samples; clinical characteristics of these patients were similar to the total sample of 469 patients. There were no significant differences among IL-6 or PGP scores whether measured as continuous or dichotomous variables, or by other scoring, and response to paclitaxel. In multivariate analysis neither IL-6 nor PGP was a significant predictor of time to progression or overall survival. IHC expression of IL-6 and PGP levels in tumor cells is not a predictive marker for response to paclitaxel in women with metastatic breast cancer.",0
Efficacy of high-dose alkylating chemotherapy in HER2/neu-negative breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: High-dose chemotherapy in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer has been abandoned by many. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 885 patients with stage III primary breast cancer and four or more axillary lymph node metastases were randomised to receive either five courses of FEC (fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide) followed by radiation therapy and tamoxifen, or the same treatment but with high-dose alkylating chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, thiotepa and carboplatin) replacing the fifth course of FEC. Of these patients, 621 had HER2/neu-negative disease, as determined by immunohistochemistry and chromogenic in situ hybridisation. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 84 months, a trend for a better relapse-free survival was observed in the high-dose arm: (hazard ratio (HR) 0.84, P = 0.076, two-sided). The 621 patients with HER2/neu-negative disease benefited from high-dose therapy, while patients with HER2/neu-positive disease did not (test for interaction, P = 0.006). There was a marked relapse-free survival benefit for patients with HER2/neu-negative disease (71.5% versus 59.1%, 5 years after randomisation; HR 0.68, P = 0.002) and also a survival benefit (78.2% versus 71.0% at 5 years; HR 0.72, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this subgroup analysis provide additional evidence that HER2/neu-positive breast cancer is relatively resistant to alkylating agents. For HER2/neu-negative tumours, however, high-dose chemotherapy should remain the subject of clinical studies.",1
Tolerability of the synthetic retinoid Fenretinide (HPR).,"Fenretinide, N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (HPR), is a synthetic retinoid which has been proven effective in inducing cell differentiation and in inhibiting carcinogen induced mammary tumors in rodents. Because of its efficacy and low toxicity in animals, HPR has been proposed for chemopreventive evaluation in humans. Thus, a randomized trial has been conducted to select a dose which can be administered over a lengthy period of time and with acceptable toxicity. The retinoid was administered orally to patients already operated on for breast cancer in daily doses of 100, 200 and 300 mg for 6 months and subsequently at 200 mg for another 6 months. No acute toxicity was found. Dermatological toxicity was minimal and no liver function abnormalities were observed. Nausea and headaches were infrequent and always mild. Menstrual irregularities were recorded with similar frequency in the treatment and placebo groups and appeared to be more age related than drug dependent. After 6 months of treatment one of 25 patients taking 300 mg HPR daily experienced impaired night vision, confirmed by the electroretinogram, and resolved by interruption of treatment. Because the 300 mg daily dose is possibly associated with impaired dark adaptation, the recommended dose for chemoprevention trials of HPR is 200 mg per day.",1
Medroxyprogesterone acetate addition or substitution for tamoxifen in advanced tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer: a phase III randomized trial. Australian-New Zealand Breast Cancer Trials Group.,"PURPOSE: To determine whether a strategy of adding medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) to tamoxifen (TAM) is superior to the substitution of MPA for TAM among women with advanced breast cancer and disease progressing on TAM. To assess the patterns or response and subsequent progression in sites and tissues according to prior involvement and treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two-hundred-fifteen postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer progressing on TAM after receiving TAM for at least six months were randomized: 109 to add MPA 500 mg/day orally (TAM + MPA), and 106 to stop TAM and to substitute MPA. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to complete plus partial response rates: TAM + MPA 10%, MPA 9%, median time to progression TAM + MPA 3.0 months, MPA 4.5 months, or median overall survival, TAM + MPA 17.2 months, MPA 18.4 months. In a multivariate model, prognostic factors significant for a shorter time to disease progression were worse for performance status, involvement of more than one tissue, prior radiotherapy, and shorter time from recurrence after primary therapy to randomization. Adjusting for these factors, treatment with TAM + MPA was associated with a higher relative risk for disease progression, with a hazards ratio of 1.31, but this was not significant (95% confidence interval, 0.98 to 1.74; P = .067). However, in an exploratory analysis, the time to disease progression, among patients with progesterone receptor positive (PR+) tumors, was 6.3 months with MPA versus 2.9 months with TAM + MPA, with a hazards ratio of 1.92 (95% confidence interval, 1.12 to 3.32; P = .02). There was a significant interaction, P = .04, between PR status and treatment, indicating an advantage to treatment substitution for those who have PR+ tumors. Tumor response occurred in 14% of assessed metastatic sites. Subsequent progression occurred in a new tissue alone in 13% of patients, in both new and previously involved (old) tissues in 76%, and in old tissues only in 11%. In 23% of patients, progression occurred only at a new site, in 50% at both old and new sites, and in 27% only at old sites. No significant differences in the patterns of response or progression were seen in the different treatment groups. CONCLUSION: Among women with breast cancer whose disease is progressing after at least six months of treatment with TAM, there is no advantage to maintaining TAM when MPA is to be given. An overall effect of treatment on the pattern of failure at old sites or at new sites or tissues cannot be discerned.",1
Improvement of hematological and general tolerance to CMF by high-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate (HD-MPA) adjuvant treatment for primary node positive breast cancer (analysis of 100 patients).,"In a prospective randomized trial comparing CMF to CMF + HD-MPA for primary node positive breast cancer patients, the authors evidenced clear improvement of hematological tolerance (especially of WBC - granulocytes counts) to chemotherapy in the group receiving also hormonotherapy. The design of the trial allowed to give the patients overall high doses of CMF therapy in both arms; in the group receiving HD-MPA significantly higher doses of CMF could be administered (96.3-97.8% for CMF + HD-MPA treated patients vs 89.7-91.1% for CMF alone treated patients). The menopausal status did not influence the results.",0
"A randomized comparison of every-2-week darbepoetin alfa and weekly epoetin alfa for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia in patients with breast, lung, or gynecologic cancer.","An important clinical question is the relative efficacy of the most common dosages of darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp; Amgen Inc.; Thousand Oaks, CA) 200 microg every 2 weeks (Q2W) and epoetin alfa (Procrit; Ortho Biotech Products, LP; Raritan, NJ) 40,000 U weekly (QW) for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia. We designed three concurrent randomized, open-label, multicenter, identical trials (with the exception of tumor type criteria of breast, gynecologic, or lung cancer) of darbepoetin alfa and epoetin alfa in patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia to validate the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire for Anemia (PSQ-An) treatment tool and to compare the efficacies and safety profiles of these two agents. In each trial, patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either darbepoetin alfa at a dose of 200 microg Q2W or epoetin alfa at a dose of 40,000 U QW for up to 16 weeks. The PSQ-An was assessed for validity, feasibility, and reliability. Secondary clinical endpoints were analyzed using the primary analysis set. Both individual trial analyses and a protocol-specified combined analysis of data from all three trials were conducted. Overall, 312 patients (157 darbepoetin alfa; 155 epoetin alfa) were randomized and received study drug. Baseline characteristics were similar in both treatment groups in each trial and overall. The PSQ-An was valid, feasible, and reliable. In general, no difference between treatment groups was observed for hemoglobin- and transfusion-based endpoints in each individual trial or in the combined analysis. From exploratory analyses, achievement and maintenance of a hemoglobin target range (11-13 g/dl) were similar in both groups. No differences in safety were observed. With the PSQ-An, formal comparisons of the impact of anemia therapies on patients and caregivers can be made in future prospective studies. Further, darbepoetin alfa (200 microg Q2W) and epoetin alfa (40,000 U QW) appear to achieve comparable clinical and hematologic outcomes.",0
"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with trastuzumab followed by adjuvant trastuzumab versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone, in patients with HER2-positive locally advanced breast cancer (the NOAH trial): a randomised controlled superiority trial with a parallel HER2-negative cohort.","BACKGROUND: The monoclonal antibody trastuzumab has survival benefit when given with chemotherapy to patients with early, operable, and metastatic breast cancer that has HER2 (also known as ERBB2) overexpression or amplification. We aimed to assess event-free survival in patients with HER2-positive locally advanced or inflammatory breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without 1 year of trastuzumab. METHODS: We compared 1 year of treatment with trastuzumab (given as neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment; n=117) with no trastuzumab (118), in women with HER2-positive locally advanced or inflammatory breast cancer treated with a neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen consisting of doxorubicin, paclitaxel, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil. Randomisation was done with a computer program and minimisation technique, taking account of geographical area, disease stage, and hormone receptor status. Investigators were informed of treatment allocation. A parallel cohort of 99 patients with HER2-negative disease was included and treated with the same chemotherapy regimen. Primary endpoint was event-free survival. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered, number ISRCTN86043495. FINDINGS: Trastuzumab significantly improved event-free survival in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer (3-year event-free survival, 71% [95% CI 61-78; n=36 events] with trastuzumab, vs 56% [46-65; n=51 events] without; hazard ratio 0.59 [95% CI 0.38-0.90]; p=0.013). Trastuzumab was well tolerated and, despite concurrent administration with doxorubicin, only two patients (2%) developed symptomatic cardiac failure. Both responded to cardiac drugs. INTERPRETATION: The addition of neoadjuvant and adjuvant trastuzumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be considered for women with HER2-positive locally advanced or inflammatory breast cancer to improve event-free survival, survival, and clinical and pathological tumour responses.

Long-term efficacy and toxicity of the FEC100 regimen.,"Adjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to be beneficial in patients with breast cancer, and anthracycline-containing regimens are more effective than non-anthracycline-containing ones. The French Adjuvant Study Group (FASG) compared FEC100 and FEC50 (fluorouracil [5-FU]/epirubicin [Ellence]/cyclophosphamide [Cytoxan, Neosar]) in patients with node-positive breast cancer, with an endpoint of overall survival. After a median follow-up of 10 years, the benefit/risk ratio of the FEC100 regimen in patients with positive axillary nodes is strongly positive. Furthermore, a medicoeconomic study showed that the cost per year of life saved was very low--approximately 1000 Euros.",1
Survival of premenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer. Long-term follow-up of Eastern Cooperative Group and Cancer and Leukemia Group B studies.,"In premenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer, differences in survival curves early during follow-up can be misleading. The authors therefore analyzed long-term survival in 378 patients, entered in three randomized trials, started between 1973 and 1978. Combined data from the three trials were used to increase the power for identifying prognostic variables. Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) trial 7382 randomized patients to oophorectomy plus either cyclophosphamide or combination chemotherapy or observation. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 2174 randomized patients who had not progressed 3 months after oophorectomy to combination chemotherapy or combination chemotherapy or observation. Trial ECOG 2177 randomized estrogen receptor (ER) positive or ER-unknown patients to oophorectomy plus combination chemotherapy or immediate combination chemotherapy, and ER-negative patients were directly assigned to combination chemotherapy. Hence ER-negative patients need not have been healthy enough to be randomized to oophorectomy. With only 14% of the patients still alive, median survival on the three studies was 30, 24, and 28 months. The median survival of individual treatments changed noticeably in ECOG 2174 and ECOG 2177 with long-term follow-up. At this time there are no differences in survival between randomized regimens in any of the three trials. In a multivariate model, factors associated with significantly poorer survival were visceral-dominant disease, nodal metastases, breast metastases, age younger than 45 years, ER negativity, and not receiving chemotherapy immediately after oophorectomy. This treatment difference was thus not due to imbalances in the prognostic variables used in the model, but it may be due to imbalances of unknown prognostic factors or differences in patient selection.",0
Telomere length in breast cancer patients before and after chemotherapy with or without stem cell transplantation.,"High-dose chemotherapy and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) may accelerate telomere length loss in haematopoietic stem cells. As data including pre-and post-treatment samples are lacking, we studied leukocyte telomere length and telomerase activity before and after treatment in breast cancer patients randomized to receive 5 adjuvant courses FEC (5-FU, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide) (n = 17), or 4 x FEC followed by high-dose cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, carboplatin and autologous PBSCT (n = 16). Haemoglobin, MCV, leukocyte-and platelet numbers were assessed prior to (t(0)), 5 months after (t(1)) and 9 months after chemotherapy (t(2)); these parameters were decreased at t(1)and t(2)compared to t(0)(high-dose: all parameters; standard-dose: leukocytes and platelets), and all parameters were lower after high-dose than standard-dose treatment at t(1). Paired individual leukocyte samples of t(0)and t(1)showed telomere length change (determined by telomere restricted fragment (TRF) assay) ranging from +0.8 to -2.2 kb, with a decreased TRF length in 9 patients of both groups. Telomerase activity (determined by TRAP assay) was below detection limit in leukocyte samples of t(0)and t(1). Thus, standard-and high-dose chemotherapy negatively affect haematological reconstitution in this setting. In individual patients, telomere length can be remarkably changed following haematological proliferative stress after treatment.",0
"5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid excretion following combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, epirubicin and 5-fluorouracil plus ondansetron compared to ondansetron alone.","The aim of the work was to evaluate the impact of cyclophosphamide and ondansetron on serotonin metabolism measured by urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) excretion. The pattern of urinary 5-HIAA excretion was analysed within 24 h following cyclophosphamide, epirubicin and 5-fluorouracil (FEC) chemotherapy (n = 14), ondansetron as single agent (n = 31), and in a control group (n = 62). 5-HIAA was measured by a fluorescence/polarisation immunoassay. Both FEC and ondansetron alone induced a significantly higher 5-HIAA increase following the first 12 h after drug administration when compared to the control group. The comparison of quantitative variables of 5-HIAA excretion between FEC and ondansetron failed to reveal any statistical differences. Cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy is associated with only minor increases of 5-HIAA excretion. Analysis of 5-HIAA excretion does not help in the description of the pathophysiology of cyclophosphamide-induced emesis. In contrast to experimental data, serotonin 3 receptor antagonism with ondansetron induces an increase of 5-HIAA excretion in humans.",0
Italian randomized trial among women with hysterectomy: tamoxifen and hormone-dependent breast cancer in high-risk women.,"Tamoxifen improves outcome in women with breast cancer and reduces the incidence of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast tumors in prevention trials. Tamoxifen use is associated with an increased risk of potentially serious adverse events, principally endometrial cancer and venous thromboembolic events and, therefore, detailed knowledge of the effects of tamoxifen is important. With more cases of breast cancer being found as the follow-up time increases, it is now possible to perform more detailed analysis of the Italian Randomized Trial of Tamoxifen. Women with hysterectomy (N = 5408) were randomly assigned to receive 20 mg tamoxifen per day (N = 2700) or placebo (N = 2708). After a median of 81.2 months of follow-up, 79 case subjects (34 in the tamoxifen arm and 45 in the placebo arm) were diagnosed with breast cancer. We were able to identify a group of women at increased risk of ER+ breast cancers (high-risk group) on the basis of baseline as well as reproductive and hormonal characteristics (height, age at menarche, parity, age at first birth, and oophorectomy). Tamoxifen administered to women in the high-risk group showed statistically significantly reduced incidence of breast cancer (tamoxifen, 3 and placebo, 15; P =.003), but no such effect was seen in the low-risk group (tamoxifen, 31 and placebo, 30; P =.89). The positive effect of tamoxifen on breast cancer among high-risk women is most marked for ER+ tumors (tamoxifen, 1 and placebo, 11; P =.002). Chemoprevention of breast cancer with tamoxifen appears to be effective in women at high risk of ER+ tumors but not among women at low risk, who may well be protected naturally by late age at menarche or early first pregnancy, or artificially by removal of the ovaries. Tamoxifen could be offered as a preventive agent to women identified at high-risk of breast cancer because of hormone-related risk factors. Such a strategy would greatly reduce the numbers of women who would need to take tamoxifen to obtain the same absolute reduction in breast cancer. These findings are exploratory and need to be confirmed in other randomized trials.",0
"Phase II, randomized trial to compare anastrozole combined with gefitinib or placebo in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer.","PURPOSE: This phase II randomized trial evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of anastrozole combined with gefitinib or anastrozole with placebo in women with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive measurable or evaluable MBC who had not received prior endocrine therapy for this disease stage or who developed metastatic disease during/after adjuvant tamoxifen were eligible. The primary response variable was progression-free survival (PFS) and secondary response variables included clinical benefit rate, objective response rate, overall survival, safety and tolerability, and pharmacokinetics. Tumor biomarker evaluation was an exploratory objective. RESULTS: Forty-three patients were randomized to anastrozole plus gefitinib and 50 patients were randomized to anastrozole plus placebo of a planned total of 174 patients (enrollment was prematurely discontinued due to slow recruitment). PFS for patients receiving the combination of anastrozole and gefitinib was longer than for patients receiving anastrozole plus placebo [hazard ratio (gefitinib/placebo), 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.32-0.94; median PFS, 14.7 versus 8.4 months]. The clinical benefit rate was 49% versus 34%, and the objective response rate was 2% versus 12% with anastrozole plus gefitinib and anastrozole plus placebo, respectively. No evidence of interaction between baseline biomarker levels and relative treatment effect was found. No unexpected adverse events were observed. CONCLUSION: This small randomized study showed that anastrozole in combination with gefitinib is associated with a marked advantage in PFS compared with anastrozole plus placebo, and that the combination was tolerated in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive MBC. Further investigation of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition in combination with endocrine therapy may be warranted.",1
Up-regulation of estrogen receptor by tamoxifen in human breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Influence of tamoxifen treatment on estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) levels in human breast cancer has not been fully elucidated in vivo. This problem was studied in 20 postmenopausal patients with ER-positive and PR-positive primary breast cancer. METHODS: Each patient underwent two fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies. Between two FNA, 10 patients received no treatment (control group) and the other 10 patients were given tamoxifen (20 mg/day) for an average of 8 days (range, 6-10 days) (TAM group). Total ER and PR values (cytosolic plus nuclear fraction) in FNA samples were determined by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for detecting ER and PR regardless of their occupancy with corresponding ligands. RESULTS: In the control group, no significant difference was found in ER and PR values between the first and second FNA samples. In the TAM group, ER and PR values (mean +/- standard error of the mean [SEM] fmol/mg DNA) in the second FNA samples were 605 +/- 186 and 1130 +/- 344, respectively, and were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than ER and PR values in the first FNA samples, which were 312 +/- 74 and 639 +/- 159, respectively. ER and PR values increased by 201 +/- 27% and 163 +/- 23%, respectively, on an individual basis after tamoxifen treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated that tamoxifen up-regulates ER and PR in human breast cancer.",0
Long-term safety of intravenous ibandronic acid for up to 4 years in metastatic breast cancer: an open-label trial.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Despite their widespread use in metastatic bone disease, some bisphosphonate drugs are associated with adverse events (AEs), particularly renal toxicity, adding to treatment burdens and increasing healthcare costs. Ibandronic acid is a single-nitrogen bisphosphonate with high efficacy against bone events and metastatic bone pain, and a renal safety profile compar- able to that of placebo. In this study, the safety of ibandronic acid was examined over a period of 4 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: During an initial 96-week period, breast cancer patients with bone metastases were randomised in double-blind fashion to placebo or ibandronic acid 6mg administered by intravenous infusion over 1-2 hours every 3-4 weeks as part of a previously reported phase III trial (MF 4265 study). All patients completing the phase III trial were offered open-label active treatment for a further 96 weeks (extension phase). A total of 62 patients received ibandronic acid 6mg in this extension phase and were classified according to their initial treatment (placebo/ibandronic acid 6mg [placebo/6mg] and ibandronic acid 6mg/ibandronic acid 6mg [6mg/6mg] groups). Safety was assessed by AE reports and clinical laboratory evaluations. RESULTS: During the 4-year study, most patients experienced at least one AE, with malignancy progression being most commonly reported. However, fewer treatment-related AEs were reported in the extension phase (placebo/6mg: 6.3% [1/16]; 6mg/6mg: 13.0% [6/46]) than in the initial phase of the study (placebo: 56.3% [9/16]; 6mg: 67.4% [31/46]). Serious AEs were mainly due to malignancy progression. There were no clinically relevant renal AEs, and in both groups, serum creatinine levels were similar for up to 4 years. CONCLUSION: This 96-week open-label safety extension of a phase III, placebo-controlled trial demonstrates that long-term use of intravenous ibandronic acid is well tolerated.",0
Prognostic significance of Ki-67 labeling index after short-term presurgical tamoxifen in women with ER-positive breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that Ki-67 response after short-term neoadjuvant aromatase inhibitors may predict recurrence in postmenopausal breast cancer, whereas its prognostic effect in premenopausal women is unknown.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We compared the prognostic and predictive value of baseline and post-treatment Ki-67 in 120 pre- and postmenopausal women with early-stage estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer who participated in a 4-week presurgical trial of tamoxifen.RESULTS: After 7.2 years of follow-up, women with post-treatment Ki-67 in the second (14%-19%), third (20%-29%) and top (≥30%) quartiles had a recurrence hazard ratio of 2.92 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95-8.96], 4.37 (1.56-12.25) and 6.05 (2.07-17.65), respectively, as compared with those in the bottom quartile (<14%) (P-trend = 0.001). The risk of invasive disease recurrence was 2.2% (95% CI 0.9-5.0) per point increase in baseline Ki-67 (P-trend = 0.076) and 5.0% (95% CI 2.3-7.7) per point increase in post-tamoxifen Ki-67 (P-trend < 0.001). The risk of death was 5.5 (95% CI 1.26-23.16) times higher in patients with post-drug Ki-67 ≥20% than in those with Ki-67 <20% (P-trend = 0.006).CONCLUSIONS: Ki-67 response after short-term neoadjuvant tamoxifen is a good predictor of recurrence-free survival and overall survival, further supporting its use as surrogate biomarker to personalize adjuvant treatment and to screen novel drugs cost-effectively.",0
Evaluation of the prognostic and predictive value of HER-1/EGFR in breast cancer patients participating in a randomized study with dose-dense sequential adjuvant chemotherapy.,"BACKGROUND: To assess the prognostic and predictive significance of HER-1/EGFR protein levels in high-risk patients with breast cancer treated with dose-dense sequential adjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS: 595 high-risk breast cancer patients were treated with adjuvant anthracycline-based dose-dense sequential chemotherapy (E-CMF vs. E-T-CMF). Disease-free survival (DFS) was the primary end point. HER-1/EGFR was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 312 patients. RESULTS: HER-1/EGFR expression was detected in 54 of 312 patients (17%). Positive expression of HER-1/EGFR was significantly associated with negative receptor status (52 vs. 17%, p < 0.001), worse histological grade (70 vs. 45%, p = 0.001), HER-2 overexpression (46 vs. 27%, p = 0.01) and positive p53 expression (48 vs. 19%, p < 0.001). With a median follow-up of 7 years, the total number of relapses was 105 (34%), and the total number of deaths 69 (22%). The analysis for DFS provides significant evidence that the HER-1/EGFR effect on the risk of disease progression was different according to treatment (interaction p = 0.02). Regarding overall survival, a trend towards a significant difference for an interaction of HER-1/EGFR and treatment was found (p = 0.07). CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated a differential effect of positive HER-1/EGFR expression in the two treatment groups, with HER-1/EGFR being a negative prognostic marker in the absence of paclitaxel.",0
Diphosphonates for osteolytic metastases.,,0
Conventional radiograms for assessment of salm-calcitonin therapy for bone metastases from breast carcinoma.,The effects of salm-calcitonin on breast cancer osteolytic skeletal metastases have been studied on conventional radiographs. Radiographic criteria for positive response have been defined. It is concluded that radiographs are inadequate for assessing the effects of salm-calcitonin.,0
A randomized phase II study of paclitaxel and bevacizumab with and without gemcitabine as first-line treatment for metastatic breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: The addition of bevacizumab to paclitaxel improved progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). We examined the efficacy and safety of adding gemcitabine to paclitaxel/bevacizumab (PB). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this multicenter, open-label, randomized phase II trial, women with locally advanced or MBC were randomly assigned to receive paclitaxel 90 mg/m(2) (days 1, 8, 15) and bevacizumab 10 mg/kg (days 1, 15) with or without gemcitabine 1500 mg/m(2) (days 1, 15) in 28-day cycles. Patients with prior cytotoxic therapy for MBC were ineligible. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed overall response rate (ORR); secondary endpoints were PFS, overall survival (OS), safety, and quality of life. RESULTS: Ninety-four patients received PB, and 93 received paclitaxel/bevacizumab/gemcitabine (PB+G). The ORRs were 48.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 38.5%-59.5%) and 58.7% (95% CI, 47.9%-68.9%; P = .117) with PB and PB+G, respectively. The median PFS was 8.8 months (95% CI, 8.1-10.4 months) and 11.3 months (95% CI, 9.7-12.7 months; P = .247; hazard ratio, 0.82); the median OS was 25.0 months (95% CI, 18.8-not assessable [N/A] months) and 24.3 months (95% CI, 20.3-N/A months; P = .475; hazard ratio, 0.84), with PB and PB+G, respectively. There was significantly more grade 3-4 neutropenia (P = .001) and dyspnea (P = .014) with PB+G. Patients treated with PB experienced more improvement in total FACT-B (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast) (P = .021), FACT-B Social/Family Well-being (P = .041), and Breast Cancer-Additional Concerns (P = .008) scores than patients treated with PB+G. CONCLUSION: The addition of gemcitabine to PB was not associated with a statistically significant improvement in ORR. Treatment with PB+G increased the incidence of severe neutropenia and dyspnea, although the regimen generally was well tolerated.",1
"Extracapsular tumor spread and the risk of local, axillary and supraclavicular recurrence in node-positive, premenopausal patients with breast cancer.","BACKGROUND: Extracapsular tumor spread (ECS) has been identified as a possible risk factor for breast cancer recurrence, but controversy exists regarding its role in decision making for regional radiotherapy. This study evaluates ECS as a predictor of local, axillary, and supraclavicular recurrence. PATIENTS AND METHODS: International Breast Cancer Study Group Trial VI accrued 1475 eligible pre- and perimenopausal women with node-positive breast cancer who were randomly assigned to receive three to nine courses of classical combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil. ECS status was determined retrospectively in 933 patients based on review of pathology reports. Cumulative incidence and hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using methods for competing risks analysis. Adjustment factors included treatment group and baseline patient and tumor characteristics. The median follow-up was 14 years. RESULTS: In univariable analysis, ECS was significantly associated with supraclavicular recurrence (HR = 1.96; 95% confidence interval 1.23-3.13; P = 0.005). HRs for local and axillary recurrence were 1.38 (P = 0.06) and 1.81 (P = 0.11), respectively. Following adjustment for number of lymph node metastases and other baseline prognostic factors, ECS was not significantly associated with any of the three recurrence types studied. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the decision for additional regional radiotherapy should not be based solely on the presence of ECS.",0
"PXR, CAR and HNF4alpha genotypes and their association with pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of docetaxel and doxorubicin in Asian patients.","Previously studied candidate genes have failed to account for inter-individual variability of docetaxel and doxorubicin disposition and effects. We genotyped the transcriptional regulators of CYP3A and ABCB1 in 101 breast cancer patients from 3 Asian ethnic groups, that is, Chinese, Malays and Indians, in correlation with the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of docetaxel and doxorubicin. While there was no ethnic difference in docetaxel and doxorubicin pharmacokinetics, ethnic difference in docetaxel- (ANOVA, P=0.001) and doxorubicin-induced (ANOVA, P=0.003) leukocyte suppression was observed, with Chinese and Indians experiencing greater degree of docetaxel-induced myelosuppression than Malays (Bonferroni, P=0.002, P=0.042), and Chinese experiencing greater degree of doxorubicin-induced myelosuppression than Malays and Indians (post hoc Bonferroni, P=0.024 and 0.025). Genotyping revealed both PXR and CAR to be well conserved; only a PXR 5'-untranslated region polymorphism (-24381A>C) and a silent CAR variant (Pro180Pro) were found at allele frequencies of 26 and 53%, respectively. Two non-synonymous variants were identified in HNF4alpha (Met49Val and Thr130Ile) at allele frequencies of 55 and 1%, respectively, with the Met49Val variant associated with slower neutrophil recovery in docetaxel-treated patients (ANOVA, P=0.046). Interactions were observed between HNF4alpha Met49Val and CAR Pro180Pro, with patients who were wild type for both variants experiencing least docetaxel-induced neutropenia (ANOVA, P=0.030). No other significant genotypic associations with pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of either drug were found. The PXR-24381A>C variants were significantly more common in Indians compared to Chinese or Malays (32/18/21%, P=0.035) Inter-individual and inter-ethnic variations of docetaxel and doxorubicin pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics exist, but genotypic variability of the transcriptional regulators PAR, CAR and HNF4alpha cannot account for this variability.",0
Bevacizumab added to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab and the antimetabolites capecitabine and gemcitabine have been shown to improve outcomes when added to taxanes in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The primary aims of this trial were to determine whether the addition of capecitabine or gemcitabine to neoadjuvant chemotherapy with docetaxel, followed by doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide, would increase the rates of pathological complete response in the breast in women with operable, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer and whether adding bevacizumab to these chemotherapy regimens would increase the rates of pathological complete response. METHODS: We randomly assigned 1206 patients to receive neoadjuvant therapy consisting of docetaxel (100 mg per square meter of body-surface area on day 1), docetaxel (75 mg per square meter on day 1) plus capecitabine (825 mg per square meter twice a day on days 1 to 14), or docetaxel (75 mg per square meter on day 1) plus gemcitabine (1000 mg per square meter on days 1 and 8) for four cycles, with all regimens followed by treatment with doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide for four cycles. Patients were also randomly assigned to receive or not to receive bevacizumab (15 mg per kilogram of body weight) for the first six cycles of chemotherapy. RESULTS: The addition of capecitabine or gemcitabine to docetaxel therapy, as compared with docetaxel therapy alone, did not significantly increase the rate of pathological complete response (29.7% and 31.8%, respectively, vs. 32.7%; P=0.69). Both capecitabine and gemcitabine were associated with increased toxic effects--specifically, the hand-foot syndrome, mucositis, and neutropenia. The addition of bevacizumab significantly increased the rate of pathological complete response (28.2% without bevacizumab vs. 34.5% with bevacizumab, P=0.02). The effect of bevacizumab on the rate of pathological complete response was not the same in the hormone-receptor-positive and hormone-receptor-negative subgroups. The addition of bevacizumab increased the rates of hypertension, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, the hand-foot syndrome, and mucositis. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of bevacizumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy significantly increased the rate of pathological complete response, which was the primary end point of this study.

Combination chemotherapy versus single-agent therapy as first- and second-line treatment in metastatic breast cancer: a prospective randomized trial.,"PURPOSE: We report results of a randomized prospective study that compared single agents of low toxicity given both as the first-line and second-line chemotherapy with combination chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer with distant metastases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients in the single-agent arm (n = 153) received weekly epirubicin (E) 20 mg/m2 until progression or until the cumulative dose of 1,000 mg/m2, followed by mitomycin (M) 8 mg/m2 every 4 weeks, and those in the combination chemotherapy arm (n = 150) were first given cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2, E 60 mg/m2, and fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 three times per week (CEF) followed by M 8 mg/m2 plus vinblastine (V) 6 mg/m2 every 4 weeks. Exclusion criteria included age greater than 70 years, World Health Organization (WHO) performance status greater than 2, prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease, and presence of liver metastases in patients younger than 50. RESULTS: An objective response (complete [CR] or partial [PR]) was obtained in 55%, 48%, 16%, and 7% of patients treated with CEF, E, M, and MV, respectively. A response to CEF tended to last longer than a response to E (median, 12 v 10.5 months; P = .07). Treatment-related toxicity was less in the single-agent arm and quality-of-life (QOL) analysis favored the single-agent arm. No significant difference in time to progression or survival was found between the two arms. Similarly, no difference in survival was found when the patients who received both the planned first-and second-line treatments were compared or when survival was calculated from the beginning of the second-line therapy. CONCLUSION: Patients treated with single-agent E followed by single-agent M had similar survival, but less treatment-related toxicity and better QOL as compared with those treated with CEF followed by MV.",1
Sequential assessment of multidrug resistance phenotype and measurement of S-phase fraction as predictive markers of breast cancer response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.,"BACKGROUND: The authors examined the relevance of S-phase fraction (SPF) and multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype as predictive tests of breast cancer response in a series of patients treated by conventional doses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with (FAC) or without (FTC) doxorubicin. METHODS: Fine needle samplings of tumors were used to measure SPF by flow cytometry before treatment (Day 0), and to assess the MDR phenotype using semiquantified reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunocytochemistry, before and after (Days 8 and 28) the first cycle of chemotherapy. RESULTS: Measurement of SPF before treatment was significantly associated with clinical response, but sequential assessment of MDR phenotype identified three groups of tumors with distinct outcomes: (1) tumors with a positive and constant expression of MDR1, in which prediction of resistance was restricted to patients treated by FAC; (2) tumors without any detectable expression, in which resistance to FAC or FTC treatments was rarely observed; and (3) tumors with an early (Day 8) acquired or increased MDR1 gene expression, which were always resistant to therapy to both treatment regimens. These results were confirmed at the protein level. CONCLUSIONS: Sequential assessment of MDR phenotype is a relevant tool for monitoring breast cancer response in neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",0
Phase III study of standard combination versus rotating regimen of induction chemotherapy in patients with hormone insensitive metastatic breast cancer: an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Intergroup Study (E3185).,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this multicenter phase III trial was to study the impact on time to treatment failure (TTF) and survival of cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, and 5-fluorouracil (CAF) versus CAF/thiotepa, Adriamycin, vinblastine, and Halotestin (TsAVbH), a partially noncross-resistant regimen used in a rotating schedule in the treatment of hormone insensitive metastatic breast cancer in accordance with the Goldie and Coldman hypothesis. METHODS: Three hundred forty-three patients received 6 cycles of induction treatment with one of 2 regimens. Patients with estrogen receptor-negative tumors or those with estrogen receptor-positive or estrogen receptor-unknown tumors with demonstrated unresponsiveness to hormone treatment were eligible. Complete responders were randomized to either observation or maintenance therapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, prednisone, tamoxifen, and Halotestin (CMF[P]TH). Patients with partial response or stable disease on completion of induction therapy were maintained on CMF plus Halotestin. RESULTS: There were no differences in the primary end point of TTF (median 7.3 and 7.4 months, respectively). There was a significant difference in TTF and survival by duration of disease-free interval: a median of 8.8 and 21.2 months for those with a disease-free interval of > or =2 years versus 6 to 8 and 13.3 months for those with a disease-free interval <2 years (P = 0.016 and <0.001), respectively. Toxicity of the 2 treatment regimens was similar. CONCLUSION: There were no differences observed in TTF, survival, and toxicities between the 2 treatment arms, both of which contained doxorubicin (Adriamycin) as the most active agent. The results of observation versus maintenance in complete responders were reported separately.",1
Virtual reality as a distraction intervention for women receiving chemotherapy.,"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To explore the use of virtual reality as a distraction intervention to relieve symptom distress in women receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer. DESIGN: Crossover study. SETTING: The outpatient clinic of a midwestern comprehensive cancer center. SAMPLE: 20 women 18-55 years of age. METHODS: Using a crossover design, 20 subjects served as their own controls. For two matched chemotherapy treatments, one pretest and two post-test measures were employed. Participants were assigned randomly to receive the virtual reality distraction intervention during one chemotherapy treatment and received no distraction intervention (control condition) during an alternate chemotherapy treatment. An open-ended questionnaire elicited each subject's evaluation of the intervention. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Symptom distress, fatigue, anxiety. FINDINGS: Significant decreases in symptom distress and fatigue occurred immediately following chemotherapy treatments when women used the virtual reality intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The distraction intervention decreased symptom distress, was well received, and was easy to implement in the clinical setting. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Nursing interventions to manage chemotherapy-related symptom distress can improve patient quality of life and increase chances for survival by reducing treatment-related symptom distress and enhancing patients' ability to adhere to treatment regimens and cope with their disease.",0
Prediction of node-negative breast cancer outcome by histologic grading and S-phase analysis by flow cytometry: an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Study (2192).,"Histologic evaluation and reporting of invasive breast cancer has effectively used Nottingham combined histologic grade (NCHG). This approach to predict outcome in invasive breast cancer has not been tested in multicenter cooperative trials. Histologic slides from selected breast cancer cases entered on node-negative Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group trials were assigned grades. Two pathologists evaluated cases for NCHG defined from differentiation, mitotic index, and nuclear grade. The study population consisted of separate samples from low- and high-risk strata, where low risk was estrogen receptor positive with a tumor size of less than 3 cm and high risk was estrogen receptor negative or tumor size greater than or equal to 3 cm. The rate of agreement was generally good, with 80% of cases classified the same for mitotic count and 76% of the cases classified the same for combined grade. There were no cases disagreeing from the lowest to the highest of the three categories. The median follow-up is 11.6 years, but for analysis of survival, this was truncated at 5 years. Mitotic index and combined grade as assessed by both pathologists showed significant associations with survival. High combined histologic grade was predictive for response to cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/5-fluorouracil (CMF) with survival differences at 5 years of 30% in the treated high-grade patients over the untreated patients. Overall, it is clear that pathologists can have close agreement in assignment of combined histologic grades, with highly significant prediction in univariate and borderline significance in multivariate analysis in prognostication of time to recurrence as well as survival. Thus, stratification used in these trials was highly prognostic as hoped, leaving a role for histologic grading in these relatively large tumors, more powerful than S-phase analysis in this series. In the subgroups of high-risk patients randomized between CMF and observation, there was a suggestion that the high-combined-grade group was predictive of treatment efficacy. We conclude that a combined histologic grade with defined criteria may be reliably assigned by practiced pathologists using readily available criteria, and that the measure may be of use in prognostication and prediction of therapeutic responsiveness when done in a technically ideal fashion.",0
Reversal of skeletal effects of endocrine treatments in the Intergroup Exemestane Study.,"The adjuvant use of aromatase inhibitors in breast cancer is associated with adverse effects on bone health. We previously reported a decline in bone mineral density (BMD) following the switch from tamoxifen to exemestane in the Intergroup Exemestane Study (IES). Here we report effects of endocrine treatment withdrawal on BMD, bone turnover markers (BTM) and fracture rates. 4,724 patients took part in IES, and 206 patients were included in a bone sub-study. BMD and BTM were assessed pre-randomization, during and after the end of treatment (EOT). To evaluate treatment withdrawal effects, 12- and 24-month post EOT BMD results are available for 122 and 126 patients, respectively. Similar patient numbers had BTM measured post EOT. Following treatment withdrawal, the differences in BMD observed between the two endocrine strategies were partially reversed. At 24 months from EOT, spine BMD increased by 1.53% (95%CI 0.63-2.43; p = 0.001) after stopping exemestane and fell by 1.93% (95%CI -2.91 to 0.95; p = 0.0002) following tamoxifen withdrawal. A similar pattern of changes was observed at the hip. At 2 years post EOT, BMD changes from baseline were similar with both treatment strategies. Corresponding inverse changes in BTM were seen, with an increase following tamoxifen withdrawal and a reduction after exemestane. A higher number of fractures occurred during exemestane treatment, but fracture rates were similar after treatment withdrawal. With the switch strategy used in IES, the on treatment adverse bone effects of exemestane are reversed. Ongoing monitoring of BMD is therefore not routinely required.",0
Phase I/II trial of adjuvant dose-dense docetaxel/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (TEC) in stage II and III breast cancer.,"This phase I/II trial investigates the safety and feasibility of six cycles of concurrent taxane, anthracycline and cyclophosphamide on a dose dense schedule. Patients with stage II/III breast cancer were treated with docetaxel (T) 75 mg/m(2), epirubicin (E) 75 mg/m(2) (cohort 1, n = 3) or 100 mg/m(2) (cohort 2, n = 12), and cyclophosphamide (C) 500 mg/m(2) IV on day 1, with pegfilgrastim 6 mg subcutaneously on day 2, every 2 weeks for six cycles. Patients were assessed for toxicity every 2 weeks; cardiac function and response (if neoadjuvant) were assessed after six cycles. All patients in cohort 1 received 100% planned dose intensity; in cohort 2, five of twelve patients received 100% and 11/12 received >80%. There were no dose reductions or delays for day 1 myelotoxicity. Dose reductions as a result of febrile neutropenia (FN) occurred in cohort 2, with six of twelve patients experiencing FN in seven of sixty-nine cycles. Six patients had anemia > or =grade 3; five received RBC transfusion and seven received an erythropoietic growth factor. Four patients required dose reductions for nonhematologic toxicity (two mucositis; one neurotoxicity; one diarrhea + cellulitis). Four patients developed thrombophlebitis, which was associated with FN in one of four. Two of fourteen evaluable patients had asymptomatic decreases in LVEF >10%; all remained within normal range. All four patients receiving neoadjuvant TEC had significant clinical responses (one CR, three PR). No pathologic CRs were seen. CONCLUSIONS: Dose dense TEC chemotherapy is feasible, has acceptable toxicity at doses equivalent to TAC (docetaxel 75 mg/m(2), epirubicin 75 mg/m(2), cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2)), and has moderate but manageable toxicity using a higher epirubicin dose of 100 mg/m(2), with FN occurring in six of twelve patients at the higher dose.",1
Adjuvant tamoxifen in postmenopausal high-risk breast cancer patients: present status of Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group trials.,"The aim of the present study was to analyze the efficacy of adjuvant tamoxifen (TAM) in postmenopausal patients with high-risk breast cancer. The primary surgical treatment was total mastectomy with axillary sampling. There were 1,650 eligible patients; 829 were randomized to receive postoperative radiotherapy (RT) and 821, to receive RT + TAM (10 mg three times daily for 1 yr). The 2 groups were identical with respect to age, tumor size, number of positive lymph nodes, degree of anaplasia, and estrogen and progesterone receptor content. Overall recurrence-free survival at 6 years was 39% in the RT group, compared to 48% in the RT + TAM group (P = 0.0008), but there was no significant difference in survival (P = 0.14). From retrospective analyses of recurrence-free survival according to prognostic variables, it appears that 4 subgroups of patients benefited from adjuvant TAM: those less than 69 years of age, those with 4 or more positive nodes, those with grade I-II tumors, and those with high estrogen receptor values (greater than 100 fmol/mg cytosol protein).",1
Cutaneous side effects in breast cancer patients treated with cytostatic polychemotherapy and rh GM-CSF: immune phenomena or drug toxicity?,"The application of recombinant colony stimulating factors for chemotherapy induced granulocytopenia is becoming common in clinical oncology. Here we report on localized cutaneous side effects after subcutaneous administration of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rh GM-CSF) in 11 patients with breast cancer receiving cytostatic treatment. Seven patients suffering from inflammatory breast cancer received cytostatic chemotherapy with mitoxantrone/cyclophosphamide, whereas four patients suffering from noninflammatory breast cancer received high-dose epirubicin/cyclophosphamide, respectively. rh GM-CSF was applicated subcutaneously in a dose of 5 micrograms/kg/d for at least ten days. In all patients, sharply demarked, maculous itching and burning erythemas restricted to the injection sites occurred after three to four injections of rh GM-CSF. These eruptions cleared within 2 to 3 weeks, but reappeared after reexposure to rh GM-CSF. In contrast to previous sporadic reports, no generalized erythemas were observed. Because of this unexpected and subjectively intolerable side effect, rh GM-CSF administration had to be interrupted in all patients. Histopathological findings revealed skin infiltration with lymphocytes, monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils, and occasionally eosinophils, respectively. Since GM-CSF is known to alter immune functions, it seems likely that the eruptions were at least in part due to local immune reactions.",0
A double-blind placebo-controlled randomized study of Chinese herbal medicine as complementary therapy for reduction of chemotherapy-induced toxicity.,"BACKGROUND: Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is a common complementary therapy used by patients with cancer for reduction of chemotherapy-induced toxic effects. This study applied the highest standard of clinical trial methodology to examine the role of CHM in reducing chemotherapy-induced toxicity, while maintaining a tailored approach to therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with early-stage breast or colon cancer who required postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy were eligible for the study. Enrolled patients were randomly assigned to one of three Chinese herbalists who evaluated and prescribed a combination of single-item packaged herbal extract granules. Patients received either CHM or placebo packages with a corresponding serial number. The placebo package contained nontherapeutic herbs with an artificial smell and taste similar to a typical herbal tea. The primary end points were hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Version 2. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty patients were accrued at the time of premature study termination. Patient characteristics of the two groups were similar. The incidence of grade 3/4 anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia for the CHM and placebo groups were 5.4%, 47.3%, 52.7%, and 1.8% and 1.8%, 32.2%, 44.7%, and 3.6%, respectively (P = 0.27, 0.37, 0.63, and 0.13, respectively). Incidence of grade 2 nausea was the only non-hematologic toxicity that was significantly reduced in the CHM group (14.6% versus 35.7%, P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Traditional CHM does not reduce the hematologic toxicity associated with chemotherapy. CHM, however, does have a significant impact on control of nausea.",0
Anastrozole as adjuvant therapy for early-stage breast cancer: implications of the ATAC trial.,"Tamoxifen has been the gold standard adjuvant therapeutic agent for postmenopausal women with hormone-sensitive breast cancer for > 25 years. Although it continues to play an important role in treating premenopausal women, tamoxifen's association with some serious safety and tolerability issues, including increased incidence of endometrial cancer and thromboembolic events, may be cause to limit its use in postmenopausal women. Anastrozole was the first drug to show improved efficacy and safety compared with standard therapies for first- and second-line therapy of hormone-sensitive advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women. This article provides a review of the results of the first major analysis of the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination (ATAC) early-stage breast cancer trial, initiated in 1996, and discusses the implications for the use of anastrozole in the adjuvant setting. This randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial compared tamoxifen (20 mg once daily) with anastrozole (1 mg) alone and in combination with tamoxifen, as adjuvant endocrine treatment for postmenopausal patients with operable, invasive, early-stage breast cancer. The results of the ATAC trial show anastrozole to be more effective and better tolerated than tamoxifen in this group of patients, and an updated follow-up suggests the therapeutic index for anastrozole will continue to remain superior to that of tamoxifen. Anastrozole is now emerging as a new standard for the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone-sensitive early-stage breast cancer. New adjuvant trials are currently using anastrozole in the control arm.",0
A randomised trial of six versus twelve courses of chemotherapy in metastatic carcinoma of the breast.,"Chemotherapy given to patients with metastatic carcinoma of the breast is palliative in intent. Longer regimens would be justified if there was a proven prolongation of symptom response or survival. We conducted a randomised trial to assess the survival of patients receiving up to six extra courses of chemotherapy compared with our conventional regimen of six courses. The patients received either VAC, VEC (vincristine, doxorubicin or epirubicin and cyclophosphamide) or MMM (mitozantrone, methotrexate and mitomycin C) therapy. Patients who had stable disease or were responding after six courses of chemotherapy were randomised to either stop or continue treatment for another six courses. Those patients receiving maintenance therapy had a significantly longer duration of response (P < 0.02) and a significantly longer progression-free survival (P < 0.01). However, there was no survival difference between the two groups. Furthermore, treatment toxicity, which was similar in the two groups, persisted for longer in the maintenance group. These results indicate no clinical advantage for giving maintenance chemotherapy in order to prolong survival of patients with metastatic breast cancer.",0
The Christie Hospital adjuvant tamoxifen trial.,"A clinical trial was carried out at The Christie Hospital, Manchester, England, between November 1976 and June 1982. Following surgery, patients with clinical stage T1-T3a, N1-N2b, M0 tumors were randomly allocated in the following way: premenopausal women to either tamoxifen 20 mg/day for 1 year or to an irradiation-induced menopause; postmenopausal women to either tamoxifen for 1 year or no further treatment (controls). In the node-negative subgroup, an analysis at a median follow-up of 10 years shows no statistically significant difference in overall or disease-free survival between tamoxifen-treated patients and irradiation-induced menopause and control patients. Side effects were few, and compliance was excellent. There was no significant increase of second primary tumors in target endocrine organs in the tamoxifen-treated patients. For the whole series of 961 patients, a log-rank analysis of events, allowing for node status, still shows a statistically significant benefit for tamoxifen-treated patients (P = .04).",1
Swiss adjuvant trials in women with node-negative breast cancer. OSAKO.,"Women with node-negative breast cancer have a 30% chance of relapse 5 years after mastectomy. If it is possible to prevent or defer recurrent disease with adjuvant systemic therapy, node-negative patients, with their low tumor burden, should theoretically benefit most from such treatment. In 1974 we started a randomized adjuvant trial in eastern Switzerland, using a subjectively less toxic regimen [chlorambucil, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (LMF)]. Two hundred fifty-four patients were randomly assigned after standardized modified radical mastectomy to observation only or to treatment with oral LMF for 6 months followed by BCG skin scarifications monthly for up to 2 years. While we find no significant statistical difference between the control group and the treated group in terms of relapse-free survival, there is a strong and consistent trend toward prolongation of overall survival within the treated group.",1
Quality of life analyses in a clinical trial of DPPE (tesmilifene) plus doxorubicin versus doxorubicin in patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer: NCIC CTG Trial MA.19.,"BACKGROUND: DPPE (tesmilifene) plus doxorubicin (DOX) demonstrated a significant improvement in survival versus DOX in a phase III clinical trial in advanced breast cancer. However, DPPE is associated with unusual toxicity in the form of hallucinations, nausea and vomiting which were anticipated to impact on short-term quality of life (QOL). METHODS: Standard National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group (NCIC CTG) approaches were applied as the primary method to analyze the QOL data from this trial. This includes cross-sectional comparisons, together with a global test for the QOL response rate. Sensitivity analyses were also performed for selected QOL domains and items, using other types of summary measures and statistics. RESULTS: Two hundred seventy one patients (89% of randomized) submitted the baseline QOL questionnaires and were included in the QOL analysis. No statistically significant difference in QOL response between treatment arms was found for any domain or item except nausea and vomiting (P = 0.04). Cross-sectional comparisons showed statistically significant differences for some domains/items at specific assessment times with all differences favoring the DOX alone arm. Patients on DPPE/DOX arm were significantly worse in terms of average and median pain change scores. CONCLUSION: Different analyses yielded slightly different conclusions but, in general, the QOL analyses were concordant and showed that patients on DOX alone had fewer disease and treatment related adverse events and better QOL. Interestingly, the QOL response analysis also showed that aggressive premedication regimens appear to ameliorate potential negative effects of DPPE on emesis and nausea as measured by patient assessed QOL.",0
Chemotherapy-induced anaemia during adjuvant treatment for breast cancer: development of a prediction model.,"BACKGROUND: At present, oncologists prescribe chemotherapy according to standard dose schedules, and as a result many patients develop serious, dose-limiting toxic effects such as anaemia. We aimed to develop a prediction model for anaemia in patients with breast cancer who were receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS: We reviewed medical records of 331 patients who had received adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. Patients were divided randomly into a derivation sample (n=221) and internal-validation sample (n=110). An external sample of 119 patients enrolled onto the control group of a randomised trial of epoetin alfa was used to validate the model further. Multivariable logistic regression was applied to develop the initial model. We then developed a risk-scoring system, ranging from 0 (low risk) to 50 (high risk), based on the final regression variables. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was done to measure the accuracy of the scoring system when applied to both validation samples. FINDINGS: The risk of anaemia increased as the pretreatment haemoglobin concentration decreased and was reduced with successive chemotherapy cycles. Risk was also predicted by a platelet count of 200x10(9) cells/L or less before chemotherapy, age 65 years or older, type of adjuvant chemotherapy, and use of prophylactic antibiotics. ROC analysis had acceptable areas under the curve of 0.88 for the internal-validation sample and 0.84 for the external validation sample. A risk score of > or = 24 to < 25 before chemotherapy was identified as the optimum cut-off for maximum sensitivity (83.5%) and specificity (92.3%) of the prediction model. INTERPRETATION: The application and continued refinement of this prediction model will help oncologists to identify patients at risk of developing anaemia during chemotherapy for breast cancer, and might enhance patient-centred care by the application of anaemia treatment in a proactive and appropriate way.",0
Adjuvant androgen treatment of operable breast cancer--a 20 year analysis.,One hundred and fifty-five patients with carcinoma of the breast treated by mastectomy were randomised to receive no additional treatment or to receive adjuvant testosterone. After a minimum follow up of 15 years there is no difference in either relapse free survival or overall survival between the treated and control groups. Stratification by pathological nodal status showed no benefit either for those with negative or positive axillary lymph node involvement.,0
Bone metabolism and quality-of-life of postmenopausal women with invasive breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant hormonal therapy: sub-analyses from celecoxib anti-aromatase neoadjuvant (CAAN) trial.,"OBJECTIVE: Anti-aromatase therapy is important in the treatment of breast cancer in postmenopausal women but they have effects on the bone mineral density (BMD) and osteoporosis. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors have been shown to be effective in chemoprevention in animal and clinical studies. A proof of principle study was performed to investigate the efficacy of combing anti-aromatase therapy (exemestane) and COX-2 inhibitors neoadjuvantly. The changes in the BMD, bone turnover proteins and quality-of-life (QoL) were analyzed and presented here. METHOD: 82 postmenopausal patients with histologically confirmed invasive hormone-sensitive breast cancers were included for the neoadjuvant therapy (NHT). 30 patients received exemestane (EXE) 25 mg daily and celecoxib (CXB) 400 mg twice daily (group A), 24 patients received EXE 25 mg daily (group B) and 28 patients received letrozole (LET) 2.5 mg daily (group C). The same assigned treatment was intended to continue for 2 years to study the changes in the bone metabolism. BMD of 48 patients were analyzed; 23 belongs to group A, 10 to group B and 15 to group C. The serum bone turnover proteins bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) and carboxyterminal crosslinked telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP), were measured with commercially available test kits before treatment, 3 months and 15 months after treatment. Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy core questionnaire (FACT-G) with its additional breast cancer subscale were performed at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after NHT. RESULT: Difference between groups (p=0.007) for BMD at femur was significant. The changes of BMD in group B patients were significantly greater than patients in group A (p=0.011, CI=0.063-0.437), and group C (p=0.003, CI=0.146-0.620). The mean BAP increased from baseline in group B patients but decreased from baseline in group C patients at 3 months and 15 months. No statistical significance was found in the FACT-G scores and FACT-B scores among different groups at baseline, week 4, week 8 and week 12 after NHT. The Breast Cancer Subscale scores in group A patients were significantly higher than that of group C patients (p=0.021). After 4 weeks of NHT, negative changes of FACT-B and FACT-G scores were found in group B and C patients, but there were positive changes in group A patients. Significant differences of FACT-B score (p=0.008) and FACT-G score (p=0.019) were observed at that time point. Article from the Special issue on Targeted Inhibitors.",0
Anastrozole ('Arimidex') blocks oestrogen synthesis both peripherally and within the breast in postmenopausal women with large operable breast cancer.,"The effect of anastrozole on peripheral and tumour aromatase activity and oestrogen levels in postmenopausal patients with oestrogen receptor-rich breast tumours was investigated. Twenty-six patients were randomly allocated to treatment with anastrozole 1 mg (n=13) or 10 mg (n=13), once daily. Before and after 12 weeks' treatment, patients were infused with 3H-Delta4 androstenedione (20 MBq) and 14C-oestrone (E1) (1 MBq) for 18 h. Oestrogens were purified from excised tumours and plasma samples taken after each infusion. Peripheral and tumour aromatase activity and tumour E1 uptake were calculated from levels of 3H and 14C in purified E1 fractions from tumour and plasma. Endogenous tumour oestrogens were measured by radioimmunoassay. Twenty-three patients were available for analysis (1 mg group, n=12; 10 mg group, n=11). Following treatment, anastrozole (1 and 10 mg) markedly inhibited peripheral aromatase in all patients (the difference between pre- and on-treatment values being highly significant P<0.0001). In situ aromatase activity was also profoundly decreased by anastrozole treatment in 16 of 19 tumours (the difference with treatment also being highly significant P=0.0009). Most tumours were able to concentrate E1 beyond levels in the circulation; anastrozole treatment had no consistent effect on uptake of E1. Endogenous tumour levels of both E1 and oestradiol (E2) were significantly reduced with therapy (P=0.028 for E1 and P=0.0019 for E2). Anastrozole (1 and 10 mg daily) effectively suppresses aromatase activity, and subsequently oestrogen levels, within the breast tissue of postmenopausal women with large or locally advanced, operable, oestrogen receptor-rich breast cancers.",1
Efficacy of letrozole extended adjuvant therapy according to estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor status of the primary tumor: National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group MA.17.,"PURPOSE: Controversy exists regarding estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PgR) receptor expression on efficacy of adjuvant endocrine therapy. In the ATAC (Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination) trial, the benefit of anastrozole over tamoxifen was substantially greater in ER+/PgR-than ER+/PgR+ tumors. In BIG 1-98 (Breast International Group), the benefits of letrozole over tamoxifen were the same in ER+ tumors irrespective of PgR. MA.17 randomized postmenopausal women after 5 years of tamoxifen, to letrozole or placebo. We present outcomes according to tumor receptor status. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Disease-free survival (DFS) and other outcomes were assessed in subgroups by ER and PgR status using Cox's proportional hazards model, adjusting for nodal status and prior adjuvant chemotherapy. RESULTS: The DFS hazard ratio (HR) for letrozole versus placebo in ER+/PgR+ tumors (N = 3,809) was 0.49 (95% CI, 0.36 to 0.67) versus 1.21 (95% CI, 0.63 to 2.34) in ER+/PgR-tumors (n = 636). ER+/PgR+ letrozole patients experienced significant benefit in distant DFS (DDFS; HR = 0.53; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.80) and overall survival (OS; HR = 0.58; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.90). A statistically significant difference in treatment effect between ER+/PgR+ and ER+/PgR-subgroups for DFS was observed (P = .02), but not for DDFS (P = .06) or OS (P = .09). CONCLUSION: These results suggest greater benefit for letrozole in DFS, DDFS, and OS in patients with ER+/PgR+ tumors, implying greater activity of letrozole in tumors with a functional ER. However, because this is a subset analysis and receptors were not measured centrally, we caution against using these results for clinical decision making.",0
Epidermal growth factor receptor and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 are specific biomarkers in triple-negative breast cancer. Results from a controlled randomized trial with long-term follow-up.,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNB) has poor prognosis and moreover patients with TNB do not benefit from established targeted drugs with endocrine therapy or trastuzumab. The aim of the study was to analyze the prevalence of candidate biomarkers in tumors from patients with TNB. Tissue microarrays were prepared from primary tumors from premenopausal breast cancer patients (500/564) randomized to adjuvant tamoxifen or no adjuvant treatment. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining included ER, PR, HER2, epidermal receptor growth factor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2). EGFR and HER2 gene copy number was defined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). All patients were included in the descriptive analysis, but only untreated patients in the survival analysis. TNB was diagnosed in 96 patients and correlated significantly to low age, Nottingham histological grade (NHG) III, high Ki67-index, T2 tumors, node negativity, EGFR positivity, increased EGFR gene copy number and high VEGFR2 expression. TNB was an independent prognostic factor for decreased 5-year breast cancer specific survival (BCSS) (HR 2.0 (95% CI 1.1-3.6), P = 0.01), but not for 10-year BCSS. High VEGFR2 expression was significantly correlated to decreased BCSS in TNB patients. TNB was associated with decreased BCSS and clinicopathological characteristics of an aggressive tumor type. High VEGFR2 expression, EGFR expression, and EGFR gene copy number were significantly correlated to TNB, supporting their role as putative candidate biomarkers for selection of targeted therapy in TNB.",0
p27 and Skp2 immunoreactivity and its clinical significance with endocrine and chemo-endocrine treatments in node-negative early breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Low p27 and high Skp2 immunoreactivity are associated with a poor prognosis and other poor prognostic features including resistant phenotypes and antiestrogen drug resistance. We investigated these proteins in two International Breast Cancer Study Group trials studying node-negative early breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Trial VIII compared chemotherapy followed by goserelin with either modality alone in premenopausal patients. Trial IX compared chemotherapy followed by tamoxifen with tamoxifen alone in postmenopausal patients. Central Pathology Office assessed p27 and Skp2 expression in the primary tumor by immunohistochemistry among 1631 (60%) trial patients. RESULTS: p27 and Skp2 were inversely related; 13% of tumors expressed low p27 and high Skp2. Low p27 and high Skp2 were associated with unfavorable prognostic factors including larger size and higher grade tumors, absence of estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 overexpression and high Ki-67 (each P < 0.05). Low p27 and high Skp2 were not associated with disease-free survival (P = 0.42 and P = 0.48, respectively). The relative effects of chemo-endocrine versus endocrine therapy were similar regardless of p27 or Skp2. CONCLUSIONS: We confirm the association of low p27 and high Skp2 with other poor prognostic features, but found no predictive or prognostic value, and therefore do not recommend routine determination of p27 and Skp2 for node-negative breast cancer.",0
Reduced cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin by a 6-hour infusion regimen. A prospective randomized evaluation.,"In order to evaluate the possible cardiosparing effect of a prolonged infusion of doxorubicin as compared with the standard mode of administration 62 consecutive patients with metastatic carcinoma of the breast or carcinoma of the ovary Stage III or IV were prospectively randomized to receive doxorubicin either as a rapid infusion over 15 to 20 minutes at 8 AM or as a continuous infusion over 6 hours, 8 AM to 2 PM. The remaining protocol was identical for the two groups. The cardiotoxic effect of doxorubicin was evaluated by history and physical examination and by the decline in resting ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) as determined by gated pool radionuclide angiography with technetium 99m (99mTc) and by the decline in the height of the QRS complexes in the standard leads of the echocardiogram (ECG). Initially there were 31 patients in each group. The cumulative dose of doxorubicin, was 410 mg/m2 +/- 42 SD in the standard infusion group and 428 mg/m2 +/- 48 SD in the 6-hour infusion group. The mean decline in LVEF after a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 300 mg/m2 was 17% in the first group and only 4.1% in the second. After 400 mg/m2 the mean fall in LVEF was 21% in the first group and 6% in the second. The mean decline in QRS voltage after 300 mg/m2 was 29% and 1.5%, respectively. Four patients, all in the standard infusion group, developed congestive heart failure. These data suggest that slow infusion of doxorubicin is associated with reduced cardiotoxicity.",0
"Breast surgery in the 'Arimidex, Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination' (ATAC) trial: American women are more likely than women from the United Kingdom to undergo mastectomy.","BACKGROUND: Various factors affect patients' decisions regarding whether to undergo surgery for the treatment of early-stage breast carcinoma. The 'Arimidex, Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination' (ATAC) trial, the largest multinational randomized trial of adjuvant therapy for patients with operable breast carcinoma to date, offers the opportunity to investigate whether nationality is one such factor. METHODS: After receiving primary therapy for early-stage breast carcinoma, 9,366 women (from a total of 21 countries) were randomized to receive anastrozole, tamoxifen, or anastrozole plus tamoxifen for 5 years. In the current study, mastectomy and breast conservation rates were compared among participating countries. The possibility that variations from country to country could be explained by inequalities in terms of pathologic, clinical, and hospital-related correlates of surgical choice was explored first on univariate analysis and then on multivariate logistic analysis. RESULTS: National mastectomy rates ranged from 20% to 97%; 51% of the 2,222 enrollees from the United States had undergone mastectomy, compared with 42% of the 3228 enrollees from the United Kingdom (odds ratio [OR], 1.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-1.60; P < 0.001). On univariate analysis, larger tumor size, positive lymph node status, higher tumor grade, older age, and adjuvant chemotherapy use were found to be correlated with mastectomy use. In contrast, positive hormone receptor status, increased body weight, and enrollment at a center that had more than 40 enrollees were found to be associated with breast conservation. The same correlates were identified on multivariate logistic analysis (P < 0.05), except that the number of enrollees at a patient's treatment center no longer possessed predictive value. After correction for these correlated factors, residence in the United States (compared with residence in the United Kingdom) remained an independent predictor of mastectomy use (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.26-1.64; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: American women enrolled in the ATAC trial were more likely to undergo aggressive surgery compared with their counterparts from the United Kingdom. More generally, nationality was found to be an independent determinant of surgical choice in the current study.",0
"Phase III trial of cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, fluorouracil (CEF) versus cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, fluorouracil (CNF) in women with metastatic breast cancer.","BACKGROUND: The mitoxantrone combination CNF and the epirubicin combination CEF have shown similar activity and less toxicity than the standard CAF combination in metastatic breast cancer (MBC). A prospective randomised study was started to compare safety and activity between CEF and CNF administered using a classical chemotherapeutic schedule in MBC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From December 1987 to June 1993, 151 patients were randomised to receive cyclophosphamide (C) 100 mg m(-2) p.o. days 1-14, fluorouracil (F) 500 mg m(-2) i.v. days 1 and 8, and epirubicin (E) 30 mg m(-2) i.v. days 1 and 8, or mitoxantrone (N) 6 mg m(-2) i.v. days 1 and 8, every 4 weeks. Seventy-three patients were eligible for CEF and 72 for CNF. RESULTS: Objective responses were observed in 61.6% of the CEF group and 44.4% in CNF group (p = 0.004). The median duration of response was 64 weeks in CEF and 50 weeks in CNF group (p = 0.02) and median time to progression was 51 and 33 weeks, respectively (p = 0.0004). At the time of analysis, all except six patients (one in CNF and five in CEF) had died and the median survival time in the CEF group was longer than in CNF (74.4 weeks vs 51.4 weeks; log-rank chi2 test p = 0.015). CNF produced more hematologic toxicity than CEF (WHO scale; grades 2-4); leucopenia 84% vs 68% (p = 0.03) and thrombocytopenia 17% vs 4.5% (p = 0.01); CEF caused more grade 2 and 3 alopecia: 93% vs 70% (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The combination CEF using this schedule and dosage in metastatic breast cancer is more effective with less toxicity than CNF, except for alopecia, and was associated with longer survival.",1
The influence of adjuvant chemotherapy on outcome after relapse for patients with breast cancer.,"This study examines the outcome following relapse for 176 patients who had been entered into a randomised trial comparing adjuvant cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) with no adjuvant therapy (controls). Relapse has occurred in 65/144 (45%) of the CMF group and 111/158 (70%) of controls (P < 0.0001). 123/176 patients received endocrine treatment after relapse with higher response rates (38 vs. 18%, P < 0.05) and longer time to progression (23 vs. 19 weeks, P = 0.03) for controls. 94/176 received chemotherapy after relapse again with higher response rates (47 vs. 23%, P = 0.05) and longer time to progression (17 vs. 9 weeks, P = 0.03) for controls. Despite this, survival after relapse was the same for the two groups (median 16 months). However, on subgroup analysis, postmenopausal patients who had received adjuvant CMF had shorter survival (P = 0.03). These results suggest that prior adjuvant therapy should be a stratification factor in clinical trials in advanced disease.",0
Intramuscular depot medroxyprogesterone versus oral megestrol for the control of postmenopausal hot flashes in breast cancer patients: a randomized study.,"BACKGROUND: Hot flashes are frequent in postmenopausal breast cancer patients, especially when treated with tamoxifen. Estrogen replacement therapy is the most effective treatment for hot flashes, but its use is controversial in breast cancer survivors. Progestins may offer a good alternative for the control of hot flashes in this setting; in particular, oral megestrol acetate has been proven effective in a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. With the aim of further improving these results, we have designed a randomized study comparing oral megestrol acetate with depot intramuscular (i.m.) medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) for the control of hot flashes in postmenopausal patients with a history of breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-one postmenopausal patients were randomized to receive an i.m. injection of depot MPA 500 mg on days 1, 14 and 28, or oral megestrol acetate 40 mg daily for 6 weeks. Patients recorded daily the number and severity of their hot flashes; response was defined as a > or =50% decrease in the number and severity of hot flashes. RESULTS: At week 6, hot flashes were reduced by 86% on average in the whole group of patients, without significant differences between the two progestins. Response was obtained by 75 and 67% of patients receiving MPA or megestrol, respectively (P = 0.5). Responders were followed to assess maintenance of response (without further treatment), which was significantly better with i.m. MPA: in this group, 89% of responders still showed a benefit at week 24, compared with 45% in the megestrol group (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that a short cycle of i.m. depot MPA injections provides significant and long-lasting relief from postmenopausal hot flashes in patients with a history of breast cancer, offering an alternative to estrogen replacement therapy or prolonged administration of oral megestrol.",0
New hormonal approaches to the treatment of breast cancer.,"From this data we can draw several conclusions. Although many new hormonal agents have been developed, there has not been significant improvement in tumor response to single agents over the past several decades. By applying knowledge of tumor ER and PR patient populations can be selected which will have a higher response rate to a given hormonal agent. The approach of combining chemotherapy and hormonal therapy does not appear to significantly alter the course of the disease. Sequential use of Tamoxifen, Premarin, and chemotherapy has been shown in cell lines and animal models to synchronize cells thus increasing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Clinical trials of this synchronization generally show higher response rates including significantly higher CR rates than chemotherapy alone. This approach appears promising and is undergoing further trials. LHRH agonists and tamoxifen are effective in premenopausal women with receptor positive tumors and may replace surgical ablative therapy. Aminoglutethimide is gaining wider acceptance as second-line therapy in postmenopausal ER-positive patients. The new agent 4-OHA may be as effective as AG but with fewer side effects. Toremifine a new antiestrogen and RU486 a new antiprogesterone are undergoing trials. While these new agents appear promising with fewer side effects or greater specificity of action, with the exception of sequential hormone priming/chemotherapy they represent 'the same old approach'. By this we mean manipulation of the hormonal environment of the cell in a continuous fashion acting via the estrogen receptor mechanism to achieve tumor regression. While certain new agents may be more tolerable, it is unlikely that a 'break through' will occur with this approach. The problem is the emergence of cells resistant to hormonal therapy. This occurs either through proliferation of a preexisting resistant clone or development under selective pressure of resistant tumors. Some but not all of these resistant clones have escaped by virtue of not having estrogen receptor present. Others have defects further along the action cascade of estrogen stimulation, such as a defective receptor which cannot bind effectively to the nuclear acceptor sites, or lacking certain other growth factors such as TGF-beta. Whatever the deficit, most patients eventually develop resistant tumors. It is in this direction, toward manipulating later points in the estrogen cascade which our attention should turn to achieve more effective hormonal therapy.",0
"A study of the biological receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand inhibitor, denosumab, in patients with multiple myeloma or bone metastases from breast cancer.","PURPOSE: Receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL) is essential for the differentiation, function, and survival of osteoclasts, which play a key role in establishment and propagation of skeletal disease in patients with multiple myeloma or bone metastases as well as many other skeletal diseases. Denosumab (AMG 162), a fully human monoclonal antibody to RANKL, was developed to treat patients with skeletal diseases. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: This was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, multicenter study to determine the safety and efficacy of denosumab in patients with breast cancer (n = 29) or multiple myeloma (n = 25) with radiologically confirmed bone lesions. Patients received a single dose of either denosumab (0.1, 0.3, 1.0, or 3.0 mg/kg s.c.) or pamidronate (90 mg i.v.). Bone antiresorptive effect was assessed by changes in urinary and serum N-telopeptide levels. Pharmacokinetics of denosumab also were assessed. RESULTS: Following a single s.c. dose of denosumab, levels of urinary and serum N-telopeptide decreased within 1 day, and this decrease lasted through 84 days at the higher denosumab doses. Pamidronate also decreased bone turnover, but the effect diminished progressively through follow-up. Denosumab injections were well tolerated. Mean half-lives of denosumab were 33.3 and 46.3 days for the two highest dosages. CONCLUSIONS: A single s.c. dose of denosumab given to patients with multiple myeloma or bone metastases from breast cancer was well tolerated and reduced bone resorption for at least 84 days. The decrease in bone turnover markers was similar in magnitude but more sustained than with i.v. pamidronate.",0
Long-term effectiveness of adjuvant goserelin in premenopausal women with early breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Systematic reviews have found that luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists are effective in treating premenopausal women with early breast cancer. METHODS: We conducted long-term follow-up (median 12 years) of 2706 women in the Zoladex In Premenopausal Patients (ZIPP), which evaluated the LHRH agonist goserelin (3.6 mg injection every 4 weeks) and tamoxifen (20 or 40 mg daily), given for 2 years. Women were randomly assigned to receive each therapy alone, both, or neither, after primary therapy (surgery with or without radiotherapy/chemotherapy). Hazard ratios and absolute risk differences were used to assess the effect of goserelin treatment on event-free survival (breast cancer recurrence, new tumor or death), overall survival, risk of recurrence of breast cancer, and risk of dying from breast cancer, in the presence or absence of tamoxifen. RESULTS: Fifteen years after the initiation of treatment, for every 100 women not given tamoxifen, there were 13.9 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 17.5 to 19.4) fewer events among those who were treated with goserelin compared with those who were not treated with goserelin. However, among women who did take tamoxifen, there were 2.8 fewer events (95% CI = 7.7 fewer to 2.0 more) per 100 women treated with goserelin compared with those not treated with goserelin. The risk of dying from breast cancer was also reduced at 15 years: For every 100 women given goserelin, the number of breast cancer deaths was lower by 2.6 (95% CI = 6.6 fewer to 2.1 more) and 8.5 (95% CI = 2.2 to 13.7) in those who did and did not take tamoxifen, respectively, although in the former group the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Two years of goserelin treatment was as effective as 2 years of tamoxifen treatment 15 years after starting therapy. In women who did not take tamoxifen, there was a large benefit of goserelin treatment on survival and recurrence, and in women who did take tamoxifen, there was a marginal potential benefit on these outcomes when goserelin was added.",1
Second malignancies following CMF-based adjuvant chemotherapy in resectable breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Only a few studies have evaluated the long-term effects of adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. Furthermore, neither the relation between the risk of second malignancies and type of adjuvant regimen utilized nor the interaction between chemotherapy and breast irradiation or age of the patients have been described in detail. METHODS: A total of 2,465 patients entered into prospective studies of CMF-based adjuvant chemotherapy carried out at the Milan Cancer Institute between June 1973 and July 1990 were evaluated. The median follow-up was 12.0 years and detailed information about therapy was available for all patients. RESULTS: At 15 years, the cumulative actuarial risk of second malignancies (excluding contralateral breast cancer and basal skin cancer) was 6.7% +/- 0.8% for the total series. The figures were 8.4% +/- 2.9% after local-regional treatment alone, 6.4% +/- 0.9% following CMF, and 5.1% +/- 1.0% following CMF plus Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Farmitalia-Carlo Erba, Milan, Italy). Compared to the general female population, the relative risk following CMF-based adjuvant chemotherapy was 1.29. Three patients, all of whom had received CMF-based chemotherapy, developed acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (cumulative risk 0.23% +/- 0.15%; relative risk 2.3). No differences were evident when breast irradiation was considered, but the cumulative risk of second tumors was slightly higher in women aged > or = 50 years at surgery (7.7% +/- 1.3%) than in younger patients (6.0% +/- 1.0%). CONCLUSIONS: At present, there is no evidence of a significantly increased risk of second malignancies following adjuvant CMF-based chemotherapy such as the one given in this case series. A low risk of acute leukemia was associated with the cumulative total dose of cyclophosphamide administered, and breast irradiation did not enhance this risk. IMPLICATIONS: Our findings suggest that there is no reason to omit alkylating agents from short-term effective adjuvant chemotherapy.",0
Primary breast lymphoma: results of a controlled clinical trial.,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and toxicity of the most employed therapeutic approaches in the treatment of primary breast lymphoma (PBL). METHODS: Ninety-six patients with PBL in the early stage (I or II) were enrolled to receive radiotherapy (45 Gy); chemotherapy (six cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP), every 21 days), or combined therapy. RESULTS: Complete response was achieved in 20 of 30 patients treated with radiotherapy, 19 of 32 who were treated with chemotherapy and 30 of 34 in the combined arm (p<0.01). Actuarial curves at 10 years showed that event-free survival was 50, 57 and 83%, respectively (p<0.01). Actuarial curves for overall survival were 50, 50 and 76% (p<0.01), respectively. The most common site of relapse was the central nervous system. Acute toxicity was mild. Until now, no second neoplasm or acute leukemia has been observed. CONCLUSIONS: In our study combined therapy is the best treatment in this special setting of patients; with improvement in event-free survival and overall survival without acute or severe late side effects. Prophylaxis to the central nervous system will be considered in the initial treatment to improve outcome.",1
Lasofoxifene and cardiovascular events in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis: Five-year results from the Postmenopausal Evaluation and Risk Reduction with Lasofoxifene (PEARL) trial.,"BACKGROUND: In the Postmenopausal Evaluation and Risk Reduction With Lasofoxifene (PEARL) trial, women assigned to lasofoxifene 0.5 mg/d had a lower risk of major coronary heart disease (CHD) events and stroke, whereas women assigned to lasofoxifene 0.25 mg/d had a lower risk of stroke. Both doses of lasofoxifene increased the risk of venous thromboembolic events. In this report, we provide comprehensive cardiovascular end-point data, including component events comprising the composite end point of major CHD events, and evaluate whether the effect of lasofoxifene 0.5 mg/d is consistent across different categories of CHD risk.METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, 8556 women 59 to 80 years of age with osteoporosis received lasofoxifene 0.25 mg/d, lasofoxifene 0.5 mg/d, or placebo for 5 years. Cardiovascular events, including major CHD events, were prespecified secondary end points. Compared with placebo, lasofoxifene 0.5 mg/d reduced the risk of major CHD events 32% (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.50 to 0.93), including the risk of coronary revascularization (hazard ratio, 0.56, 95% confidence interval, 0.32 to 0.98). Reductions in risk of hospitalization for unstable angina (hazard ratio, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.29 to 1.04) and diagnosis of new ischemic heart disease (hazard ratio, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.26 to 1.04) nearly reached significance (P=0.06 for both comparisons). Although both hazard ratios were <1.0, no significant effect of lasofoxifene at 0.5 mg/d was demonstrated for coronary death or nonfatal myocardial infarction. The reduction in CHD events with lasofoxifene 0.25 mg/d was not significant (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.56 to 1.03; P=0.08). The effectiveness of lasofoxifene 0.5 mg/d in reducing CHD events was similar across strata of major cardiovascular risk factors.CONCLUSIONS: In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, lasofoxifene 0.5 mg/d for 5 years reduced the risk of CHD events, regardless of the presence or absence of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The significant reduction in risk of CHD events with lasofoxifene 0.5 mg/d was due primarily to lower risks of coronary revascularization procedures, hospitalization for unstable angina, and diagnosis of new ischemic heart disease.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Estrogen receptor determination and long term survival of patients with carcinoma of the breast.,"To investigate whether or not hormone receptor determination gives independent prognostic information for long term survival of patients with carcinoma of the breast, we studied 1,392 patients with early carcinoma of the breast. Patients were part of two prospective, multi-institutional trials, the first begun in 1974 and the second in 1980. Estrogen receptor assays were performed on all primary specimens taken of the carcinoma of the breast. Initial treatment for all patients was a modified radical mastectomy. Nine hundred and seventeen patients had negative axillary nodes and were observed without additional therapy. Four hundred and seventy-five had positive nodes and were randomized to receive combination chemoendocrine adjuvant therapy. One thousand and sixty-three (76.4 per cent) of the patients were found to have estrogen receptor positive (ER+) tumors (greater than or equal to 3 femtomoles per milligram cytosol of protein). The ten year over-all survival rate of 65.9 per cent was significantly better than that of 329 (23.6 per cent) patients with estrogen receptor negative (ER-) tumors (less than 3 femtomoles per milligram cytosol protein), who had a ten year over-all survival rate of 56.0 per cent (p = 0.0001). Higher estrogen receptor values were associated with Caucasian (p = 0.0001) and postmenopausal patients (p = 0.0001). In a proportional hazards regression model, patients with ER+ tumors had a significantly longer over-all survival period (p = 0.0001), but only a marginally improved disease-free survival time (p = 0.07) when compared with patients who had ER- tumors. These results indicate that ER determination does have prognostic value for long term over-all survival of patients with carcinoma of the breast. The greater importance of ER analysis to over-all compared with disease-free survival may be related to more easily managed recurrent disease among the ER+ group.",0
Recombinant human thrombopoietin augments mobilization of peripheral blood progenitor cells for autologous transplantation.,"This study assessed the ability of various schedules of recombinant human thrombopoietin (rhTPO) to enhance mobilization of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) in 134 patients with cancer undergoing high-dose chemotherapy and autologous PBPC transplantation. Patients received the study drug on days 1, 3, and 5 before initiation of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) 10 microg/kg/day on day 5 and pheresis starting on day 9. Randomly assigned treatments on days 1, 3, and 5 were: group 1 (n=27) placebo, placebo, rhTPO 1.5 microg/kg; group 2 (n=27) rhTPO 1.5 microg/kg, placebo, placebo; groups 3 (n=28) and 4 (n=22) rhTPO 0.5 microg/kg on all 3 treatment days; and group 5 (n=30) placebo on all 3 treatment days. After high-dose chemotherapy and PBPC transplantation, groups 1 through 4 received rhTPO 1.5 microg/kg days 0, +2, +4, and +6 with either G-CSF 5 microg/kg/day (groups 1-3) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor 250 microg/m(2)/day (group 4). Group 5 received placebo plus G-CSF 5 microg/kg/day. The addition of rhTPO to G-CSF increased median CD34+ cell yield/pheresis in cohorts in which rhTPO was started before day 5, with higher yields in groups 2 (2.67 x 10(6)/kg) and groups 3 and 4 (3.10 x 10(6)/kg) than in group 1 (1.86 x 10(6)/kg) or group 5 (1.65 x 10(6)/kg) (P=.006 across groups). Comparing rhTPO to placebo, higher percentages of patients achieved the minimum yield of CD34+ > or =2 x 10(6)/kg (92% v 75%; P=.050) as well as the target yield of CD34+ > or =5 x 10(6)/kg (73% v 46%; P= .041). rhTPO-treated patients required fewer phereses to achieve minimum (P= .011) and target (P= .015) CD34+ cell values. rhTPO given after transplantation did not speed platelet recovery. No neutralizing antibodies were observed. We conclude that rhTPO can safely enhance mobilization of PBPC, reduce the number of leukapheresis, and allow more patients to meet minimal cell yield requirements to receive high-dose chemotherapy with PBPC transplantation.",0
Prospective controlled cohort studies on long-term therapy of breast cancer patients with a mistletoe preparation (Iscador).,"BACKGROUND: Mistletoe preparations such as Iscador (Weleda, Schwäbisch Gmünd, Germany) are commonly used in complementary and alternative / anthroposophic medicine for many cancer indications, particularly for solid cancers. Efficacy of this complementary therapy is still controversial. OBJECTIVE: Does long-term therapy with Iscador show any effect on survival, tumor progression and psychosomatic self-regulation of patients with breast cancer? PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective recruitment and long-term follow-up of two controlled cohort studies: (1) Randomized matched-pair study (38 pairs): breast cancer patients without any recurrences or metastases and no mistletoe therapy were matched for prognostic factors. By pairwise random allocation, one of the patients was suggested mistletoe therapy to be applied by the attending physician. (2) Non-randomized matched-pair study (84 pairs): breast cancer patients without recurrences or metastases that already received mistletoe therapy were matched to control patients without Iscador therapy. RESULTS: For overall survival, the nonrandomized study shows significant effects in favor of Iscador therapy: hazard ratio HR estimate and 95% confidence interval CI: 0.43 (0.27-0.68). The effect of long-term Iscador therapy on tumor progression as measured by the time to local recurrences, lymphatic or distant metastases in breast cancer patients without any such events at first diagnosis, is in most cases significant in favor of the Iscador group, in the randomized as well as in the non-randomized study. Psychosomatic self-regulation in the Iscador group improves significantly within 12 months compared with the control group in the randomized as well as in the non-randomized study: estimate of the median difference and 95% CI: 0.35 (0.05-0.60), respectively 0.20 (0-0.35). CONCLUSION: Iscador shows a clinically relevant effect on breast tumor progression as measured by overall survival as well as by the time to recurrences, lymphatic or distant metastases. In the short term, psychosomatic self-regulation increases more markedly under complementary Iscador therapy than under conventional therapy alone.",0
Tetrabenazine as antichorea therapy in Huntington disease: a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Tetrabenazine (TBZ) selectively depletes central monoamines by reversibly binding to the type 2 vesicular monoamine transporter. Open-label reports indicate TBZ is effective in treating chorea. OBJECTIVE: To examine the safety, efficacy, and dose tolerability of TBZ for treating chorea in Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: The authors randomized 84 ambulatory patients with HD to receive TBZ (n = 54) or placebo (n = 30) for 12 weeks. TBZ was increased over 7 weeks up to a maximum of 100 mg/day or until the desired antichoreic effect occurred or intolerable adverse effects supervened. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in the chorea score of the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) RESULTS: TBZ treatment resulted in a reduction of 5.0 units in chorea severity compared with a reduction of 1.5 units on placebo treatment (adjusted mean effect size = -3.5 +/- 0.8 UHDRS units [mean +/- SE]; 95% CI: -5.2, -1.9; p < 0.0001). There was also a significant benefit on ratings of clinical global improvement. There were five study withdrawals in the TBZ group and five serious adverse events (SAEs) in four subjects (drowning suicide, complicated fall, restlessness/suicidal ideation, and breast cancer) compared with one withdrawal and no SAEs in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: Tetrabenazine (TBZ), at adjusted dosages of up to 100 mg/day, effectively lessens chorea in ambulatory patients with Huntington disease. TBZ should be dosed individually based on ongoing assessment of possible adverse side effects.",0
Failure of higher-dose paclitaxel to improve outcome in patients with metastatic breast cancer: cancer and leukemia group B trial 9342.,"PURPOSE: Cancer and Leukemia Group B Protocol 9342 was initiated to determine the optimal dose of paclitaxel administered as a 3-hour infusion every 3 weeks to women with metastatic breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred seventy-four women with metastatic breast cancer who had received one or no prior chemotherapy regimens were randomly assigned to one of three paclitaxel dosing regimens-175 mg/m(2), 210 mg/m(2), or 250 mg/m(2)-each administered as a 3-hour infusion every 3 weeks. Women completed self-administered quality of life and symptom assessment questionnaires at baseline and after three cycles of treatment. RESULTS: No evidence of a significant dose-response relationship was demonstrated over the dose range assessed. Response rates were 23%, 26%, and 21% for the three regimens, respectively. A marginally significant association (P =.04) was seen between dose and time to progression; however, in a multivariate analysis, the difference was even less apparent. No statistically significant difference was seen in survival. Neurotoxicity and hematologic toxicity were more severe on the higher dose arms. There was no significant difference in quality of life on the three arms. CONCLUSION: Higher doses of paclitaxel administered as a 3-hour infusion to women with metastatic breast cancer did not improve response rate, survival, or quality of life. There was a slight improvement in time to progression with higher dose therapy, which was offset by greater toxicity. When a 3-hour infusion of paclitaxel is administered every 3 weeks, 175 mg/m(2) should be considered the optimal dose.",1
Skeletal effects of raloxifene after 8 years: results from the continuing outcomes relevant to Evista (CORE) study.,"UNLABELLED: In the CORE breast cancer trial of 4011 women continuing from MORE, the incidence of nonvertebral fractures at 8 years was similar between placebo and raloxifene 60 mg/day. CORE had limitations for assessing fracture risk. In a subset of 386 women, 7 years of raloxifene treatment significantly increased lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD compared from the baseline of MORE. INTRODUCTION: The multicenter, double-blind Continuing Outcomes Relevant to Evista (CORE) trial assessed the effects of raloxifene on breast cancer for 4 additional years beyond the 4-year Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation (MORE) osteoporosis treatment trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In CORE, placebo-treated women from MORE continued with placebo (n = 1286), whereas those previously given raloxifene (60 or 120 mg/day) received raloxifene 60 mg/day (n = 2725). As a secondary endpoint, new nonvertebral fractures were analyzed as time-to-first event in 4011 postmenopausal women at 8 years. A substudy assessed lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD at 7 years, with the primary analysis based on 386 women (127 placebo, 259 raloxifene) who did not take other bone-active agents from the fourth year of MORE and who were > or =80% compliant with study medication in CORE. RESULTS: The risk of at least one new nonvertebral fracture was similar in the placebo (22.9%) and raloxifene (22.8%) groups (hazard ratio [HR], 1.00; Bonferroni-adjusted CI, 0.82, 1.21). The incidence of at least one new nonvertebral fracture at six major sites (clavicle, humerus, wrist, pelvis, hip, lower leg) was 17.5% in both groups. Posthoc Poisson analyses, which account for multiple events, showed no overall effect on nonvertebral fracture risk, and a decreased risk at six major nonvertebral sites in women with prevalent vertebral fractures (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.63, 0.96). At 7 years after MORE randomization, the differences in mean lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD with raloxifene were 1.7% (p = 0.30) and 2.4% (p = 0.045), respectively, from placebo. Compared with MORE baseline, after 7 years, raloxifene treatment significantly increased lumbar spine (4.3% from baseline, 2.2% from placebo) and femoral neck BMD (1.9% from baseline, 3.0% from placebo). BMDs were significantly increased from MORE baseline at all time-points at both sites with raloxifene. CONCLUSION: Raloxifene therapy had no effect on nonvertebral fracture risk after 8 years, although CORE had limitations for fracture risk assessment. BMD increases were maintained after 7 years of raloxifene.",0
Capecitabine in the routine treatment of advanced breast cancer: results from a non-interventional observational study in 876 [corrected] patients.,"BACKGROUND: This observational study evaluated patient characteristics, treatment schedule and setting, efficacy and tolerability of capecitabine in routine clinical practice in Germany. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced breast cancer pretreated with or ineligible for anthracycline-containing therapy were treated with capecitabine. Data were collected until disease progression or completion of 12 cycles (with long-term follow-up in progression-free patients). RESULTS: 846 of the 876 [corrected] patients enrolled between 2002 and 2007 were eligible. Capecitabine was administered as monotherapy in 64% (median starting dose 1,070 mg/m(2) bis in diem (b.i.d.)) and combination chemotherapy (typically with vinorelbine or docetaxel) in 36% (median starting dose 987 mg/m(2) b.i.d.). Capecitabine was given as first-line therapy in 35% of patients. Objective response rate was 41% and median progression-free survival was 7.5 months. Good performance status at baseline was a significant predictor of efficacy. The most common non-hematological toxicity was hand-foot syndrome (all grades: 54%; grade 3: 7%). Myelosuppression and alopecia were substantially less common with capecitabine monotherapy than with capecitabine combination regimens. CONCLUSIONS: Capecitabine, alone or in combination, is a feasible, effective treatment for breast cancer. Our findings in real-life clinical practice compare favorably with results from interventional studies, perhaps reflecting the longer treatment duration possible at more tolerable doses.",0
Effect of neoadjuvant anthracycline-taxane-based chemotherapy in different biological breast cancer phenotypes: overall results from the GeparTrio study.,"In order to explore the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) on clinical mid-course and pathological complete response (pCR) at surgery in different biological breast cancer subtypes. The GeparTrio study included 2,072 patients with operable or locally advanced breast cancer. After two cycles with docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC) patients were randomized according to their clinical response. Clinical and biological factors were assessed for predicting clinically mid-course response and pCR at surgery. The overall pCR rate, defined as no invasive residuals in breast and axilla, was 20.5%. The highest pCR rate of 57% was observed in patients below 40 years of age with triple negative or grade 3 tumors. Independent factors for mid-course response and pCR were: young age, non-T4 tumors, high grade, and hormone receptor status, the strongest single predictive factor. Within the biological subtypes, grading was an independent factor to predict pCR for luminal tumors, clinical tumor stage for the HER2 like tumors and age for the triple negative ones. Grading gave independent information for mid-course response within the triple negative group. No factor predicted mid-course response within the other groups. Grading and age can identify subgroups within the luminal and triple negative patients who have an increased benefit from NACT.",1
Improved quality of life after long-term treatment with the bisphosphonate ibandronate in patients with metastatic bone disease due to breast cancer.,"Bone metastases occur in most women with advanced breast cancer and can lead to considerable morbidity and a rapid deterioration in the patient's quality of life. It was the aim of the present study to assess changes in quality of life and bone pain due to intravenous (i.v.) ibandronate, a potent third-generation bisphosphonate. In a phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with bone metastases due to breast cancer, 466 women were randomised to receive placebo, 2 mg ibandronate or 6 mg ibandronate for up to 96 weeks. Treatment was administered i.v. at 3- or 4-weekly intervals. Clinical endpoints included the incidence of adverse events, quality of life (assessed using the European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Scale - Core 30 questionnaire (QLQ-C30)), and bone pain (assessed on a 5-point scale from 0=none to 4=intolerable). Ibandronate was generally well tolerated. Compared with baseline measurements, the bone pain score was increased at the last assessment in both the placebo and 2 mg ibandronate groups, but was significantly reduced in the patients receiving 6 mg ibandronate (-0.28+/-1.11, P < 0.001). A significant improvement in quality of life was demonstrated for patients treated with ibandronate (P < 0.05) for all global health status. Overall, at the last assessment, the 6 mg ibandronate group showed significantly better functioning compared with placebo (P = 0.004), and had significantly better scores on the domains of physical, emotional, and social functioning, and in global health status (P < 0.05). Significant improvements in the symptoms of fatigue and pain were also observed in the 6 mg ibandronate group. I.v. ibandronate treatment leads to significant improvements in quality of life, and is an effective and well-tolerated palliative treatment in patients with bone metastases due to breast cancer.",0
"Ondansetron compared with granisetron in the prophylaxis of cyclophosphamide-induced emesis in out-patients: a multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy, randomised, parallel-group study. Emesis Study Group for Ondansetron and Granisetron in Breast Cancer Patients.","This is the first double-blind clinical trial in a homogenous group of patients to compare the recommended dosing schedules of ondansetron and granisetron in the control of prolonged emesis after cyclophosphamide-containing chemotherapy (48% CMF, 35% EC) for breast cancer. A total of 514 patients were recruited. Of the 488 patients included in the intent-to-treat analyses, 167 were randomised to group A [8 mg ondansetron intravenously (i.v.) + placebo by mouth (p.o.) before chemotherapy + 8 mg ondansetron p.o. twice daily (b.d.) until day 5], 155 to group B (placebo i,.v. + 8 mg ondansetron p.o. before chemotherapy + 8 mg ondansetron p.o. b.d. until day 5) and 166 to group C (3 mg granisetron i.v. + placebo p.o. before chemotherapy + placebo p.o. b.d. until day 5). On study day 1, the groups were comparable with respect to the proportion of patients experiencing up to 2 emetic episodes (group A: 89%; B: 86%; C: 91%) and in the severity of nausea (no nausea; group A: 51%; B: 55%; C: 54%). Over the 5-day study period significantly more patients were rescued or withdrawn due to lack of response after the granisetron regimen (26%) than after the i.v. + p.o. ondansetron regimen (11%; p < 0.001). Since there was no difference in these parameters on day 1, this reflects differences on days 2-5 and was also reflected in the all-oral ondansetron group over this period (group B: 12%; C: 22% on days 2-5). A significant difference in the severity of nausea after i.v. and p.o. ondansetron compared with granisetron was also observed over the 5-day study period (p = 0.009). This was reflected in a numerical difference in favour of the all-p.o. ondansetron regimen compared with the granisetron regimen (no nausea; group A: 33%; B: 34%; C: 25%). Again these differences reflected differences in nausea control on days 2-5, since no differences were observed on day 1. Logistic regression analyses adjusted for prognostic factors also revealed a significant difference (p = 0.011) in favour of the i.v. + ondansetron group compared with the granisetron group when complete plus major response was compared over days 2-5. No significant differences in the safety profiles of the three treatment groups were observed. There were no severe or unexpected drug-related adverse events and as is well established for the serotonin receptor antagonists, mild constipation (mean 8%) and mild headache (mean 8%) were most commonly reported.",0
'Atrophic telogen effluvium' from cytotoxic drugs and a randomized controlled trial to investigate the possible protective effect of pretreatment with a topical vitamin D analogue in humans.,"BACKGROUND: Hair loss from cytotoxic drugs is classically ascribed to the loss of fractured hairs (anagen effluvium). Telogen hair loss has also been described but some authors have denied any effect on the hair cycle. There are conflicting reports on a protective effect of pretreatment with a vitamin D analogue on cytotoxic drug-induced hair loss in rodents. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the process of cytotoxic hair loss and any protective effect on the hair of pretreatment with topical calcipotriol. METHODS: Breast cancer patients who were about to receive cycles of chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide 600 mg m(-2), methotrexate 40 mg m(-2) and 5-fluorouracil 600 mg m(-2) were recruited and randomized to receive calcipotriol scalp solution 50 microg mL(-1) or vehicle. The solution was applied twice daily from 4 days prior to chemotherapy and continued for 14 days in each treatment cycle. Shed, plucked and cut hairs were sampled. Absolute shed rates, the proportion of major hair types, the presence of proximal hair shaft changes, regrowth (using the new anagen hair count) and hair density were assessed. RESULTS: Ten patients receiving calcipotriol and 14 receiving vehicle completed three treatment cycles and nine from both groups completed six cycles. There was no detectable effect of calcipotriol on the proportion of patients experiencing minimal hair loss from chemotherapy, shed rates, plucked telogen and fractured hair counts, the morphology of shed and plucked hair, hair regrowth or hair density. Combining results of the treatment groups, there was a large variation in the impact of chemotherapy on hair loss, from total loss in five patients to no obvious loss in five. Excluding the latter, during chemotherapy shed telogen hairs (mean 81% of shed hairs) predominated over fractured (12%) and anagen hairs (6%) (P = 0.0002). The major pathological change was proximal hair shaft tapering, baseline mean 3% of shed hairs rising to 48% (P = 0.0005) during treatment, and there was a consequent decrease in normal telogen hairs, baseline mean 98% of all telogen hairs falling to 55% (P = 0.0005) during treatment. The pathological tapered telogen hairs had normal or small, sometimes diminutive, bulbs. Fracturing of hairs with diminutive bulbs produced typical 'exclamation mark' hairs. CONCLUSIONS: The cardinal effects of cytotoxic drugs found in this study were tapering of the proximal hair shaft and premature entry of the follicle into telogen, conflicting with the conventional view that affected hair follicles continue in anagen. There was a resulting effluvium of a mixture of tapering telogen hairs and fractured hairs. As entry into telogen is an integral part of the process, cytotoxic hair loss may be regarded as a variant of the conventional 'telogen effluvium' and we propose the term 'atrophic telogen effluvium'. There was no obvious protective effect on the hair loss of prior treatment with topical calcipotriol.",0
"The cathepsin K inhibitor odanacatib suppresses bone resorption in women with breast cancer and established bone metastases: results of a 4-week, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial.","BACKGROUND: Metastatic bone disease (MBD) is a frequent complication in patients with breast cancer and is associated with significant morbidity. This study assessed the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of odanacatib, a selective Cat K inhibitor, in reducing markers of bone resorption in women with breast cancer and MBD.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women with breast cancer and MBD were randomized 2:1 (double-blind) to oral odanacatib 5 mg daily for 4 weeks or intravenous (I.V.) zoledronic acid (ZA) 4 mg given once at study initiation. Plasma samples were collected for pharmacokinetic analysis. Bone resorption was assessed by measuring urinary N-telopeptide of type I collagen corrected for creatinine (uNTx; primary objective, pmol BCE/µmol creatinine). Adverse events (AEs) were monitored throughout the 4-week study and up to 14 days after last dose.RESULTS: A total of 43 patients (mean age, 60 years) received odanacatib (n = 29) or ZA (n = 14); 40 patients completed 4 weeks of treatment. The mean percent change in uNTx values at week 4 was -77% (95% CI, -82 to -71; odanacatib) and -73% (95% CI, -80 to -62; ZA). Mean (standard deviation) plasma concentration of odanacatib was 511.7 (202.9) nM; the range was 63.7-844.8 nM. The most common AEs were nausea, vomiting, headache, and bone pain, which were generally not attributed to study drug.CONCLUSION: Odanacatib suppressed uNTx similarly to ZA after 4 weeks of treatment in women with breast cancer and MBD. Odanacatib was generally safe and well tolerated. These results suggest that Cat K inhibition is a potentially important, novel therapeutic approach for treating MBD.",0
Adjuvant high-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate for early breast cancer: 13 years update in a multicentre randomized trial.,"The authors updated their report on a randomized trial initiated in 1982 comparing, in early breast cancer, high-dose IM Medroxyprogesterone acetate (HD-MPA) adjuvant hormonotherapy during 6 months with no hormonotherapy; node-positive patients also received 6 courses of IV CMF (day 1, day 8; q.4 weeks). 246 node-negative (NN) and 270 node-positive (NP) patients had been followed for a median duration of 13 years. Previous results were confirmed in this analysis on mature data. In NN patients, relapse-free survival (RFS) was improved in the adjuvant hormonotherapy arm, regardless of age while overall survival (OAS) was also increased in younger (less then 50 years) patients. In the whole group of NP patients, no difference was seen regarding RFS or OAS. However, an age-dependant opposite effect was observed: younger patients (< 50) experienced a worse and significant outcome of relapse-free and overall survivals when receiving adjuvant HD-MPA while older patients (> or = 50) enjoyed a significant improvement of their relapse-free survival. For both NN and NP patients, differences in overall survivals observed in older women with a shorter follow-up, were no longer detected.",1
Tumor-specific expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 but not vascular endothelial growth factor or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 is associated with impaired response to adjuvant tamoxifen in premenopausal breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) are often coexpressed in breast cancer, and potentially affect cellular pathways and key proteins such as the estrogen receptor (ER) targeted by endocrine treatment. We therefore explored the association between adjuvant tamoxifen treatment in breast cancer and expression of VEGF-A and VEGFR2, as well as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), which represents a candidate gene product involved in tamoxifen resistance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemical expression of tumor-specific VEGF-A, VEGFR2, and HER2 was evaluated in tumor specimens from premenopausal breast cancer patients randomly assigned to 2 years of tamoxifen or no treatment (n = 564), with 14 years of follow-up. Hormone receptor status was determined in 96% of the tumors. RESULTS: VEGF-A, VEGFR2, and HER2 were assessable in 460, 472, and 428 of the tumors, respectively. In patients with ER-positive and VEGFR2-low tumors, adjuvant tamoxifen significantly increased recurrence-free survival (RFS; [HR] hazard ratio for RFS, 0.53; P = .001). In contrast, tamoxifen treatment had no effect in patients with VEGFR2-high tumors (HR for RFS, 2.44; P = .2). When multivariate interaction analyses were used, this difference in treatment efficacy relative to VEGFR2 expression status was statistically significant for both ER-positive (P = .04) plus ER-positive and progesterone receptor-positive tumors. We found no significant difference in tamoxifen treatment effects in relation to VEGF-A or HER2 status. CONCLUSION: Tumor-specific expression of VEGFR2 was associated with an impaired tamoxifen effect in hormone receptor-positive premenopausal breast cancer. Tamoxifen in combination with VEGFR2 inhibitors might be a novel treatment approach for VEGFR2-expressing breast cancer, and such a treatment might restore the tamoxifen response.",0
Analysis of cause-specific failure endpoints using simple proportions: an example from a randomized controlled clinical trial in early breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: To describe a statistically valid method for analyzing cause-specific failure data based on simple proportions, that is easy to understand and apply, and outline under what conditions its implementation is well-suited. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In the comparison of treatment groups, time to first failure (in any site) was analyzed first, followed by an analysis of the pattern of first failure, preferably at the latest complete follow-up time common to each group. RESULTS: A retrospective analysis of time to contralateral breast cancer in 777 early breast cancer patients was undertaken. Patients previously treated by mastectomy plus radiation therapy to the chest wall and regional nodal areas were randomized to receive further radiation and prednisone (R+P), radiation alone (R), or no further treatment (NT). Those randomized to R+P had a statistically significantly delayed time to first failure compared to the group randomized to NT (p = 0.0008). Patients randomized to R also experienced a delayed time to first failure compared to NT, but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.14). At 14 years from the date of surgery (the latest common complete follow-up time) the distribution of first failures was statistically significantly different between R+P and NT (p = 0.005), but not between R and NT (p = 0.09). The contralateral breast cancer first failure rate at 14 years from surgery was 7.2% for NT, 4.6% for R, and 3.7% for R+P. The corresponding Kaplan-Meier estimates were 13.2%, 8.2%, and 5.4%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Analyzing cause-specific failure data using methods developed for survival endpoints is problematic. We encourage the use of the two-step analysis strategy described when, as in the example presented, competing causes of failure are not likely to be statistically independent, and when a treatment comparison at a single time-point is clinically relevant and feasible; that is, all patients have complete follow-up to this point.",0
"Adjuvant docetaxel for high-risk, node-negative breast cancer.","BACKGROUND: A regimen of docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC) is superior to a regimen of fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) when used as adjuvant therapy in women with node-positive breast cancer. The value of taxanes in the treatment of node-negative disease has not been determined.METHODS: We randomly assigned 1060 women with axillary-node-negative breast cancer and at least one high-risk factor for recurrence (according to the 1998 St. Gallen criteria) to treatment with TAC or FAC every 3 weeks for six cycles after surgery. The primary end point was disease-free survival after at least 5 years of follow-up. Secondary end points included overall survival and toxicity.RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 77 months, the proportion of patients alive and disease-free was higher among the 539 women in the TAC group (87.8%) than among the 521 women in the FAC group (81.8%), representing a 32% reduction in the risk of recurrence with TAC (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49 to 0.93; P=0.01 by the log-rank test). This benefit was consistent, regardless of hormone-receptor status, menopausal status, or number of high-risk factors. The difference in survival rates (TAC, 95.2%; FAC, 93.5%) was not significant (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.45 to 1.26); however, the number of events was small (TAC, 26; FAC, 34). Rates of grade 3 or 4 adverse events were 28.2% with TAC and 17.0% with FAC (P<0.001). Toxicity associated with TAC was diminished when primary prophylaxis with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was provided.CONCLUSIONS: As compared with adjuvant FAC, adjuvant TAC improved the rate of disease-free survival among women with high-risk, node-negative breast cancer.

Ten year results of a randomised trial comparing two conservative treatment strategies for small size breast cancer.,"We report the 10-year results of a randomised clinical trial in which two different breast conservation treatment strategies were compared in women with small, non-metastatic primary breast cancer: quadrantectomy, axillary dissection and radiotherapy (QUART) versus tumorectomy and axillary dissection followed by external radiotherapy and a boost with 192Ir implantation (TART). No second surgery was given to women with affected surgical margins. Axillary node positive women received adjuvant medical therapy. From 1985-1987, this trial accrued 705 patients, 360 in the QUART and 345 in the TART arm. Crude cumulative incidence curves for intrabreast tumour recurrence (IBTR) and metastases as first events and mortality curves in each of the two treatment arms were computed. A crude cumulative incidence curve of IBTR as a second event (in women who had already had a local recurrence) was also computed. The two groups were compared in terms of hazard for IBTR, metastases or death occurrence by using Cox regression models, both with and without adjustment for patient age, tumour size, number of metastatic axillary nodes and histology. Possible interactions between the aforementioned prognostic factors and the type of surgery were also investigated. The two groups were well matched for baseline patient and tumour characteristics, the only exception being resection margins, which were more often positive in the TART group. At the Cox model, a significant difference between groups was detected for IBTR (P < 0.0001), but not for distant metastases and overall survival. In particular, 5- and 10-year estimates of crude cumulative incidence of IBTR were 4.7 and 7.4% in the QUART group and 11.6 and 18.6% in the TART group. The difference was not substantially affected by patient or disease characteristics. Likewise, the status of resection margins in women who underwent TART treatment did not significantly influence the risk of occurrence of IBTRs. Finally, the rate of second IBTR occurrence was relatively high, when compared with the rate of IBTR occurrence as first event. In summary, the results of this trial show that a better local control of the disease can be obtained with the more extensive surgical resection, i.e. QUART.",0
UFT/oral calcium folinate plus weekly paclitaxel for metastatic breast cancer.,"Paclitaxel (Taxol) is one of the most active drugs in the treatment of ovarian and breast cancers. Combination therapy with paclitaxel and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) exhibits high activity in anthracycline-pretreated breast cancer, yielding response rates of 54% to 69% in recent studies. Weekly dosing of paclitaxel produces notable activity, while maintaining relatively low toxicity in heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer patients. Uracil and tegafur (UFT) plus oral calcium folinate constitute an orally administered compound known as Orzel. This agent provides activity comparable to that of intravenously administered 5-FU plus calcium folinate, with the additional attributes of ease of administration and a more favorable side-effect profile. We initiated a phase I dose-finding trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicities of the combination of weekly paclitaxel by 1-hour infusion plus UFT/oral calcium folinate administered to patients with anthracycline-resistant metastatic breast cancer.",1
"A preliminary report of a pilot randomized trial comparing cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil with cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone and 5-fluorouracil in the adjuvant therapy of stage II breast cancer with four or more positive axillary nodes.","Thirty-eight patients with stage II breast cancer with four or more positive axillary lymph nodes were randomized to receive CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil, every 3 weeks) or CXF (cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone and 5-fluorouracil, every 3 weeks). Pretreatment characteristics were similar for both groups. The actuarial 5 year disease-free survival (DFS) was 36% for the CMF group and 23% for the CXF group. The actuarial 5 year survival was 60% for the CMF arm and 66% for the CXF arm. These differences were not statistically significant. Partial alopecia was observed in 42% of patients in the CMF arm and in 100% of those receiving CXF (p = 0.0002). No episodes of leucopenic fever were observed in patients receiving CMF, while they were present in 53% of patients treated with CXF (p = 0.0006). No stomatitis occurred in the CMF group, but it was observed in 90% of patients who received CXF (p < 0.0001). Treatment with CXF had to be discontinued in two patients because of toxicity. In this small group of patients with poor prognosis, it seems that CXF at the doses given here is more toxic but not more effective than CMF, as represented by a similar DFS and survival.",1
"A randomized phase-II study of BB-10010 (macrophage inflammatory protein- 1alpha) in patients with advanced breast cancer receiving 5-fluorouracil, adriamycin, and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy.","BB-10010 is a variant of the human form of macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha), which has been shown in mice to block the entry of hematopoietic stem cells into S-phase and to increase their self-renewal capacity during recovery from cytotoxic damage. Its use may constitute a novel approach for protecting the quality of the stem cell population and its capacity to regenerate after periods of cytotoxic treatment. Thirty patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer were entered into the first randomized, parallel group controlled phase II study. This was designed to evaluate the potential myeloprotective effects of a 7-day regimen of BB-10010 administered to patients receiving six cycles of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), adriamycin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) chemotherapy. Patients were randomized, 10 receiving 100 microgram/kg BB-10010, 11 receiving 30 microgram/kg BB-10010, and nine control patients receiving no BB-10010. BB-10010 was well-tolerated in all patients with no severe adverse events related to the drug. Episodes of febrile neutropenia complicated only 4% of the treatment cycles and there was no difference in incidence between the treated and nontreated groups. Studies to assess the generation of progenitor cells in long-term bone marrow cultures were performed immediately preceding chemotherapy and at the end of six dosing cycles in 18 patients. Circulating neutrophils, platelets, CD 34(+) cells, and granulocyte/macrophage colony-forming cell (GM-CFC) levels were determined at serial time points in cycles 1, 3, and 6. The results showed similar hemoglobin and platelet kinetics in all three groups. On completion of the six treatment cycles, the average pretreatment neutrophil levels were reduced from 5.3 to 1.7 x 10(9)/L in the control patients and from 4.3 to 1.9 and 4.5 to 2.5 x 10(9)/L in the 30/100 microgram/kg BB-10010 groups, respectively. Relative to their pretreatment values, 50% of the patients receiving BB-10010 completed the treatment with neutrophil values significantly higher than any of the controls (P = .02). Mobilization of GM-CFC was enhanced by BB-10010 with an additional fivefold increase over that generated by chemotherapy alone, giving a maximal 25-fold increase over pretreatment values. Bone marrow progenitor assays before and after this standard regimen of chemotherapy indicated little long-term cumulative impairment to recovery from chemotherapy. Despite the limited cumulative damage to the bone marrow, which may have minimized the protective value of BB-10010 during this regimen of chemotherapy, better recovery of neutrophils in the later treatment cycles with BB-10010 was indicated in a number of patients.",0
Preoperative second-line chemotherapy induces objective responses in primary breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: Preoperative chemotherapy in patients with primary breast cancer results in high response rates, allowing breast-conserving surgery in patients primarily not suitable for this procedure. Tumors of patients with histologically proven breast cancer that fail to respond to preoperative chemotherapy are thought to be chemotherapy resistant. We questioned this hypothesis and treated 13 patients who did not respond to preoperative anthracycline-containing first-line treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight patients received a combination therapy consisting of epidoxorubicin and docetaxel as neoadjuvant first-line treatment and were treated with CMF as preoperative second-line chemotherapy. The other five patients did not respond to first-line FEC and were given paclitaxel or docetaxel as second-line treatment. RESULTS: A major response to treatment was observed in 10 of 13 patients (77%) during preoperative second-line therapy: one patient (8%) achieved pathological complete response (pCR) and nine patients (69%) partial response (PR). Three patients (23%) had stable disease (SD), and no patient had progressive disease (PD). Eight patients (62%) could undergo breast-conserving surgery. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that it is possible to achieve objective responses including pCR with potentially non-cross-resistant neoadjuvant second-line therapy, leading to breast-conserving surgery in a high proportion of patients. Thus, preoperative second-line chemotherapy appears to be justified when breast conservation is an important treatment goal and may have potential in improved tailoring of neoadjuvant treatments.",1
"A randomized trial of doxorubicin, mitoxantrone and bisantrene in advanced breast cancer (a South West Oncology Group Study).","New agents with increased activity and/or reduced toxicity are needed for the treatment of advanced breast cancer. The anthracene derivatives mitoxantrone and bisantrene had significant activity and acceptable toxicity in phase II trials. In an ongoing phase III trial we have now randomized 150 patients with advanced breast cancer to either doxorubicin (60 mg/m2), mitoxantrone (14 mg/m2) or bisantrene (260 mg/m2) i.v. q 3 weeks with re-randomization for cross-over at the time of progression to determine the relative efficacy and toxicity of these three agents. To be eligible, patients must have had only one previous chemotherapy regimen. ER positive patients must have failed endocrine therapy. Patients with CHF or severe cardiac disease were ineligible. In this preliminary evaluation, 117 patients are evaluable for response and 110 for toxicity. Median age for all patients is 58 years (range 26-78). The majority (86%) are postmenopausal. Fifty-nine percent percent of the patients have visceral dominant disease. Estrogen receptor is positive in 37%, negative in 39% and unknown in 24% of patients. Median performance status (SWOG) is 1, range 0-2. Objective responses have been observed on each arm (doxorubicin 9/35, mitoxantrone 6/38, bisantrene 6/44). Thirty-two patients are evaluable for cross-over response (doxorubicin 2/13, mitoxantrone 1/11, bisantrene 0/8). The predominant toxicity is leukopenia with a nadir WBC count less than 2000 in 45% of all courses administered. Leukopenia is similar with the three drugs. Significant nausea, vomiting and alopecia are common with doxorubicin and uncommon with the other agents. Congestive heart failure has been observed in one patient (doxorubicin). Definitive conclusions regarding the efficacy and toxicity of these agents await the completion of this trial.",1

"Conversion of psoriasis patients from the conventional formulation of cyclosporin A to a new microemulsion formulation: a randomized, open, multicentre assessment of safety and tolerability.","OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of a new cyclosporin A (CyA) microemulsion formulation, Sandimmun Neoral (Neoral), in patients with severe psoriasis that was stable on CyA administered as Sandimmun (SIM). METHODS: In this 24-week, open, randomized, prospective, multicentre trial, 28 patients continued on the same dosage of SIM, while 30 converted to Neoral at 2.5 mg/kg/day or a dosage equivalent to their pre-conversion SIM dosage. During the study, dosages could be adjusted to maintain efficacy, because of adverse events or after disease stabilization. The maximum permitted dosage for either formulation was 5.0 mg/kg/day. Primary efficacy criteria were change in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) from baseline and time to relapse. RESULTS: The dosage was increased to maintain efficacy in 22 patients (Neoral 13; SIM 9) and 20 dose reductions for safety were required (Neoral 14, SIM 6). In both groups, PASI scores remained stable throughout and relapses were primarily a result of dosage reduction after disease stabilization. No significant difference was found between groups in the proportion of patients remaining relapse-free. Adverse events were recorded in 20 patients receiving Neoral and 14 receiving SIM. Most drug-related events were of mild or moderate severity and reflected the known CyA side-effect profile. Dose titration guidelines ensured that mean blood pressure and serum creatinine concentrations remained stable in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: If the guidelines for CyA use are followed and the Neoral dosage does not exceed 5 mg/kg/day, conversion of stable patients with severe psoriasis from SIM to Neoral should present no clinically relevant safety or tolerability problems and efficacy of treatment is maintained.",0
Competing causes of death from a randomized trial of extended adjuvant endocrine therapy for breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Older women with early-stage breast cancer experience higher rates of non-breast cancer-related death. We examined factors associated with cause-specific death in a large cohort of breast cancer patients treated with extended adjuvant endocrine therapy. METHODS: In the MA.17 trial, conducted by the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group, 5170 breast cancer patients (median age = 62 years; range = 32-94 years) who were disease free after approximately 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen treatment were randomly assigned to treatment with letrozole (2583 women) or placebo (2587 women). The median follow-up was 3.9 years (range 0-7 years). We investigated the association of 11 baseline factors with the competing risks of death from breast cancer, other malignancies, and other causes. All statistical tests were two-sided likelihood ratio criterion tests. RESULTS: During follow-up, 256 deaths were reported (102 from breast cancer, 50 from other malignancies, 100 from other causes, and four from an unknown cause). Non-breast cancer deaths accounted for 60% of the 252 known deaths (72% for those > or = 70 years and 48% for those < 70 years). Two baseline factors were differentially associated with type of death: cardiovascular disease was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of death from other causes (P.002), and osteoporosis was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of death from other malignancies (P.05). An increased risk of breast cancer-specific death was associated with lymph node involvement (P < .001). Increased risk of death from all three causes was associated with older age (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Non-breast cancer-related deaths were more common than breast cancer-specific deaths in this cohort of 5-year breast cancer survivors, especially among older women.",0
Long-term assessment of quality of life in the Intergroup Exemestane Study: 5 years post-randomisation.,"BACKGROUND: The Intergroup Exemestane Study (IES) (ISRCTN11883920) demonstrated improved survival for postmenopausal women with ER-positive/unknown primary breast cancer who switched to exemestane after 2-3 years tamoxifen, compared with those continuing on tamoxifen to complete 5 years therapy. This was achieved without detriment to on-treatment quality-of-life (QoL). We report on- and post-treatment QoL impact in IES. METHODS: A total of 582 patients from 8 countries participated in the QoL substudy. Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) and endocrine symptom subscale (ES) were completed at baseline, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48 and 60 months. The primary endpoint was FACT-B Trial Outcome Index (TOI); secondary endpoints included severity of individual endocrine symptoms. RESULTS: Both the groups showed gradual improvement in overall QoL and lessening of total endocrine symptoms post treatment compared with baseline (P<0.002). There was no evidence of any between-group differences in TOI. Vasomotor complaints remained high on treatment. Vaginal discharge was more frequent (P<0.01) with tamoxifen up to 24 months from baseline. In both the groups, post-treatment libido did not recover to baseline levels. CONCLUSION: Clinical benefits of switching to exemestane are accompanied by good overall QoL. Although some symptoms persist, the majority of endocrine symptoms improve after treatment completion.",0
Monitoring serum HER2 levels during neoadjuvant trastuzumab treatment within the GeparQuattro trial.,"In the context of neoadjuvant therapy (NT) for breast cancer patients, different targeted therapy approaches are currently evaluated in clinical trials. Serum markers could help to monitor and optimize such treatment strategies. We investigated human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 serum (sHER2) levels in 175 breast cancer patients participating in the GeparQuattro trial. This study incorporated NT approaches and additional trastuzumab treatment for all patients with HER2-positive tumors. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 serum levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) before initiation of NT and after NT (pre-surgery) in a HER2-positive (n = 90) and a HER2-negative patient cohort (n = 85). Median pre-chemotherapy sHER2 levels were higher in patients with positive HER2 status of the primary tumor than in patients with negative HER2 status (14.9 ng/ml vs. 7.7 ng/ml, P < 0.001). A pre-chemotherapy sHER2 cut-off level of 10 ng/ml had the best sensitivity and specificity in discriminating between HER2-positive and HER2-negative primary tumors. In HER2-positive patients, we found a significant positive association between pathological complete remission (pCR) and elevated sHER2 levels (above 15 ng/ml, P = 0.045) and a decrease of sHER2 levels during NT (P = 0.02), which was also significant in multivariate analysis (OR = 3.29, 95% CI 1.001-10.89, P = 0.049). In HER2-negative patients, we observed no association between sHER2 levels and pCR (P > 0.05). Monitoring sHER2 levels in the presence of anti-HER2 treatment might be an adjunct to the clinical evaluation during NT.",0
Effects of a progestogen on normal human breast epithelial cell apoptosis in vitro and in vivo.,"Many investigators have reported cyclic proliferation of normal human breast epithelial cells. A delicate balance between proliferation and apoptosis (programmed cell death) ensures breast homeostasis. Both the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle are characterized by proliferation, whereas apoptosis occurs only at the end of the latter phase. In this study, we observed that the withdrawal of a synthetic progestin (nomegestrol acetate or NOMAC), but not continuous treatment with it, induced apoptosis of normal human breast epithelial cells in vitro and in women who applied NOMAC gel to their breasts. Furthermore, this apoptotic response was specific to normal breast cells, since withdrawal of NOMAC did not induce apoptosis of tumoral T47D cells in vitro or of fibroadenoma cells in women. These observations open up new perspectives in the prevention of hyperplasia and breast cancer.",0
"Influence of comorbidities and age on risk of death without recurrence: a retrospective analysis of the Arimidex, Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination trial.","PURPOSE: The Arimidex, Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination (ATAC) study was a double-blind randomized trial in which postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer were assigned to receive anastrozole, tamoxifen, or the combination. We have conducted a retrospective analysis to examine the effects of comorbidities and age on treatment received, breast cancer-related mortality, and competing causes of mortality. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The current analyses were based on 10-year median follow-up data in the two monotherapy arms (anastrozole, n = 3,092; tamoxifen, n = 3,094) of the ATAC study. Baseline comorbidities and tumor and treatment characteristics were compared between women age less than 70 years and women age ≥ 70 years. The cumulative incidence of breast cancer-related and non-breast cancer-related mortality was assessed according to age and comorbidities. RESULTS: One thousand six hundred sixty-two patients (27%) were age ≥ 70 years at study entry. Older women were more likely to undergo mastectomy (odds ratio [OR], 1.92; 95% CI, 1.71 to 2.16) and less likely to receive radiotherapy (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.55) or chemotherapy (OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.29). Women age ≥ 70 years had an increased risk of recurrence compared with women age less than 70 years (hazard ratio [HR], 1.21; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.37) and a substantially increased risk of death without recurrence (HR, 4.13; 95% CI, 3.53 to 4.83). The risk of death without recurrence increased with comorbidity score (10-year estimates of 8.4%, 20.0%, and 30.4% for Satariano score 0, 1, and 2+, respectively; P < .001). CONCLUSION: Age influences the risk of recurrence, and age and comorbidities significantly influence the risk of death without recurrence. Formal assessment of comorbidities should be incorporated into decisions regarding adjuvant therapies.",0
Epirubicin at two dose levels with prednisolone as treatment for advanced breast cancer: the results of a randomized trial.,"Two hundred eleven patients with advanced breast cancer were randomized to receive either epirubicin (E) 50 mg/m2 and prednisolone (LEP) or E 100 mg/m2 and prednisolone (HEP). The intended treatment consisted of 16 courses of LEP or eight courses of HEP given at 3-weekly intervals. Reasons for stopping treatment early included progressive disease, stable disease without symptomatic improvement, or severe toxicity deemed intolerable by either the patient or physician. Toxicity was recorded at 3-weekly and response at 9-weekly intervals using the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria of response and toxicity. Two hundred nine patients were eligible for analysis, 98% of whom have been followed for more than a year. One hundred four patients received LEP and 105 HEP. Significantly worse myelosuppression, alopecia, nausea and vomiting, and mucositis were seen in the high-dose arm (P less than or equal to .001). More patients in the LEP arm stopped treatment before the fourth course than in the HEP arm, and the commonest reason for stopping was progressive disease. A similar median number of courses was given in each arm. There was a significantly higher response in the HEP arm (HEP - complete response [CR] + partial response [PR] = 41%, LEP - CR + PR = 23%). Despite this, no statistically significant differences was seen in overall survival or progression-free interval. The median survival for HEP and LEP was 44 and 46 weeks, respectively.",1
Zoledronic acid prevents bone loss in premenopausal women with early breast cancer undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy: a phase III trial of the Korean Cancer Study Group (KCSG-BR06-01).,"To determine whether zoledronic acid (ZA) can prevent bone loss in premenopausal women undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. In this randomized, open-label, phase III multicenter trial, premenopausal women >40 years were randomly assigned to ZA treatment (4 mg IV, every 6 months) or observation after surgery. All patients were treated with four cycles of AC followed by four cycles of taxane. Between March 2007 and May 2008, we assessed a total of 112 premenopausal women, all of whom developed amenorrhea at 1 year after chemotherapy. The mean percent change of BMD in the lumbar spine (LS) was -1.1% in the ZA group versus -7.5% in observation group at 12 months. Differences in percent change of BMD from baseline between the two groups were 6.4% for the LS, and 3.6% for the femoral neck. The mean levels of bone turnover at 12 months were significantly lower in the ZA group. ZA was generally well tolerated. Infusion of ZA 4 mg every 6 months effectively prevented bone loss within the first year in premenopausal women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for early breast cancer. Regular BMD measurements and early bisphosphonate therapy should be considered in these patients.",0
Randomized trial of aminoglutethimide versus tamoxifen in metastatic breast cancer.,"We compared antiestrogen therapy (tamoxifen) with an estrogen suppression regimen (aminoglutethimide-hydrocortisone) in postmenopausal women with metastatic breast carcinoma. Fifteen of 39 patients (38%) who received tamoxifen experienced an objective tumor regression (3 complete, 12 partial remissions), whereas 13 of 36 women (36%) receiving aminoglutethimide responded (one complete remission, 12 partial remissions). The median duration of response was similar. The site of tumor involvement appears to be important in choosing between these hormonal treatments. Aminoglutethimide appears to offer a greater chance of response in patients with bone involvement.",1
Tamoxifen versus chemotherapy as adjuvant treatment in stage III breast cancer.,"A randomized prospective trial was conducted to compare Tamoxifen and combination chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide) as adjuvant treatment for patients with locally advanced (Stage III) breast cancer. At the end of 5 years, no significant difference could be found in the disease-free period for both groups.",1
Refractory breast cancer: a comparison of two different chemotherapy regimens.,"Sixty metastatic and recurrent breast cancer patients who had been given cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and fluorouracil (CMF) therapy previously and were treated at the Oncology Departments of Cukurova and Ege University Medical Schools between March 1992-94, were randomized into 2 groups for the chemotherapy program. The 30 patients in the 1st group were given etoposide: 200 mg x day x 5 days orally every 3 weeks. The 30 patients of the 2nd group were given fluorouracil: 500 mg x m2, doxorubicin: 5O mg/m2, cyclophosphamide: 500 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks. The response rates were 21/30 in group 1 and 17/30 in group 2. The median duration of responses was 11 months (8-21) in the 1st and 9 months (4-18) in the 2nd group. Severe myelotoxicity was observed in 2 of the patients in the 1st group and in 5 of the patients in the 2nd group.",1
"Effect of exercise on biomarkers, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and depressive symptoms in older women with breast cancer receiving hormonal therapy.","PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To compare the effectiveness of a prescribed home-based walking exercise intervention with usual care in older women receiving hormonal treatment for breast cancer, and to examine relationships among levels of the cortisol, serotonin, interleukin-6, and bilirubin biomarkers and fatigue, sleep disturbances, and depressive symptoms. DESIGN: Longitudinal randomized clinical trial. SETTING: A National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center in the southeastern United States. SAMPLE: 20 women (aged 55 years or older) with breast cancer receiving hormonal treatment. METHODS: Participants were randomized to a walking exercise intervention or usual care. Laboratory samples and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Piper Revised Fatigue Scale, and the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale were collected at the initial clinic visit and at 12 weeks from the groups. Questionnaires also were collected at weeks 2 and 14. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Fatigue, sleep disturbances, depressive symptoms, biomarkers, and exercise. FINDINGS: Effect of the exercise intervention on sleep scores was highly significant between groups. Exercise group scores on the PSQI decreased significantly over time (indicating improved sleep quality), although scores did not change significantly within the control group. Sleep actigraphy also showed significantly shorter actual wake time and less movement in the exercise group. Serotonin levels also were significantly affected by the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Data suggest that a walking exercise intervention improves sleep in older women receiving hormonal treatment for their breast cancer. Serotonin levels may be a useful biomarker when assessing sleep disturbances in this group. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Clinicians need to be aware that older women receiving hormonal treatment for their breast cancer may experience fatigue, sleep disturbances, and depressive symptoms. Homebased walking activity may reduce symptom severity in this group.",0
A randomised phase II study of sialyl-Tn and DETOX-B adjuvant with or without cyclophosphamide pretreatment for the active specific immunotherapy of breast cancer.,"Studies in animal models of mouse mammary carcinoma have shown that ovine submaxillary mucin, which carries multiple sialyl-Tn (STn) epitopes, is effective in stimulating an immune response and inhibiting tumour growth. In similar studies using carbohydrate antigens, pretreatment with low-dose cyclophosphamide has been shown to be important in modulating the immune response to antigen possibly by inhibiting suppresser T-cell activity. In a clinical trial assessing the efficacy and toxicity of synthetic STn, patients with metastatic breast cancer were randomised to receive 100 micrograms STn linked to keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH) with DETOX-B adjuvant given by subcutaneous injection at weeks 0, 2, 5 and 9 with or without low-dose cyclophosphamide (CTX, 300 mg m-2) pretreatment, 3 days before the start of immunotherapy. Patients with responding or stable disease after the first four injections were eligible to receive STn-KLH at 4 week intervals. The main toxicity noted was the development of subcutaneous granulomata at injection sites. Of 23 patients randomised, 18 received four injections, 5 patients having developed progressive disease during the initial 12 week period. Two minor responses were noted in the 18 patients who received four active specific immunotherapy (ASI) injections and a further five patients had stable disease. Six patients continued ASI at 4 week intervals and a partial response was noted in a patient who had previously had stable disease. All patients developed IgG and IgM responses to sialyl-Tn and levels of IgM antibodies were significantly higher in those patients who were pretreated with CTX. Measurable tumour responses have been recorded following ASI with STn-KLH plus DETOX and the immunomodulatory properties of low-dose CTX have been confirmed.",0
"Phase II study of temsirolimus (CCI-779), a novel inhibitor of mTOR, in heavily pretreated patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.","PURPOSE: In this study, two doses of temsirolimus (CCI-779), a novel inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin, were evaluated for efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who had been heavily pretreated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (n = 109) were randomly assigned to receive 75 or 250 mg of temsirolimus weekly as a 30-minute intravenous infusion. Patients were evaluated for tumor response, time to tumor progression, adverse events, and pharmacokinetics of temsirolimus. RESULTS: Temsirolimus produced an objective response rate of 9.2% (10 partial responses) in the intent-to-treat population. Median time to tumor progression was 12.0 weeks. Efficacy was similar for both dose levels but toxicity was more common with the higher dose level, especially grade 3 or 4 depression (10% of patients at the 250-mg dose level, 0% at the 75-mg dose level). The most common temsirolimus-related adverse events of all grades were mucositis (70%), maculopapular rash (51%), and nausea (43%). The most common, clinically important grade 3 or 4 adverse events were mucositis (9%), leukopenia (7%), hyperglycemia (7%), somnolence (6%), thrombocytopenia (5%), and depression (5%). CONCLUSION: In heavily pretreated patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, 75 and 250 mg temsirolimus showed antitumor activity and 75 mg temsirolimus showed a generally tolerable safety profile.",1
"Adjuvant doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide versus cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy in premenopausal women with axillary lymph node positive breast carcinoma.","BACKGROUND: This randomized controlled trial was to determine whether a combination chemotherapy regimen that contains anthracycline (doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide [AC]) is superior to the conventional cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil [CMF] combination in premenopausal women with axillary lymph node positive Stage II breast carcinoma. METHODS: Premenopausal women with lymph node positive breast carcinoma were stratified according to age (younger than 35 or 35 years or older) and the number of positive axillary lymph nodes (1-3, 4-9, or >/= 10) and then randomly assigned to receive either doxorubicin 40 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) intravenously (i.v.) every 3 weeks or cyclophosphamide 100 mg/m(2) orally on Days 1 through 14, methotrexate 40 mg/m(2) and 5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2) i.v. on Days 1 and 8 every 4 weeks. Both arms were scheduled for six cycles. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 57 months. Eighteen of the 55 AC patients developed recurrence compared with 16 of the 69 CMF patients. The corresponding 5-year recurrence free survival rates were 64% and 78%, respectively (P = 0.12). The site of the first recurrence for AC patients was locoregional in 7%, distant in 22%, and combined in 4%. The corresponding data for the CMF arm were 4%, 16%, and 3%, respectively. Six AC patients died compared with 9 CMF patients. The corresponding 5-year survival rates were 90% and 86%, respectively (P = 0.96). More leukopenia (52%, mostly Grade 1-2) occurred in the CMF arm than in the AC arm (33%, P = 0.001), but no febrile episode was accompanied with leukopenia. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed no difference between AC and CMF with respect to both disease free and overall survival rates in premenopausal women with axillary lymph node positive breast carcinoma.",1
Quantitative PCR analysis of c-erb B-2 (HER2/neu) gene amplification and comparison with p185(HER2/neu) protein expression in breast cancer drill biopsies.,"A PCR assay using capillary electrophoresis was designed for the detection of c-erbB-2 gene amplification in alcohol-formalin-acetic acid (AFA)-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsies from 81 consecutive breast tumors. c-erbB-2 expression was analyzed in the same samples using immuno-histochemistry (IHC). In the competitive PCR assay, a single pTag plasmid containing a 4-nucleotide (nt)-deleted copy of a 124-nt sequence of c-erbB-2 and a 4-nt-deleted copy of a 120-nt sequence of GAPDH was co-amplified with genomic DNA extracted from 3 10-micrometer-thick tissue sections of the tumor biopsy. The percentage of tumor cells in the biopsy specimen and the percentage of tumor cells stained with the membrane anti-c-erbB-2 monoclonal antibody CB11 were recorded by a single pathologist on 2 consecutive sections. Among 81 consecutive tumor biopsies assayed by PCR, 21 (26%) displayed unequivocal c-erbB-2 amplification (actual gene copy number, AGCN > 4), 47 (58%) displayed no c-erbB-2 amplification (AGCN </= 2) and 7 (9%) could not be analyzed due to an insufficient amount of DNA. Six samples (7%) were considered inconclusive since the percentage of tumor cells was <20%. Analysis of c-erbB-2 expression by IHC showed that among the 21 amplified specimens 15 displayed strong staining, while all non-amplified samples (47) displayed no or only weak staining. The concordance of the 2 techniques was 91%. We conclude that c-erbB-2 gene amplification can be accurately quantitated by competitive PCR performed on small, fixed and embedded tumor samples.",0
Clinical outcomes of ethnic minority women in MA.17: a trial of letrozole after 5 years of tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with early stage breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Aromatase inhibitors are widely employed in the adjuvant treatment of early stage breast cancer. The impact of aromatase inhibitors has not been established in ethnic minority women. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of letrozole on minority women in MA.17, a placebo-controlled trial of letrozole following 5 years of tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with early stage breast cancer. Retrospective comparison of disease-free survival (DFS), side effects, and mean changes in quality of life (QOL) scores from baseline between Caucasian and minority women was performed. RESULTS: Minority (n = 352) and Caucasian (n = 4708) women were analyzed. There was no difference between these groups in DFS (91.6% versus 92.4% respectively for 4 year DFS). Letrozole, compared with placebo, significantly improved DFS for Caucasians (HR = 0.55; P < 0.0001) but not for minorities (HR = 1.39; P = 0.53). Among women who received letrozole, minorities had a significantly lower incidence of hot flashes (49% versus 58%; P = 0.02), fatigue (29% versus 39%; P = 0.005), and arthritis (2% versus 7%; P = 0.006) compared with Caucasians. Mean change in QOL scores for minority women who received letrozole demonstrated improved mental health at the 6-month assessment (P = 0.02) and less bodily pain at the 12-month assessment (P = 0.046). CONCLUSION: Letrozole improved DFS in Caucasians but a definite benefit in minority women has not yet been demonstrated. Minority women tolerated letrozole better than Caucasians in terms of toxicity. These results need confirmation in other trials of aromatase inhibitors.",0
Tumor therapeutic response and vessel tortuosity: preliminary report in metastatic breast cancer.,No current non-invasive method is capable of assessing the efficacy of brain tumor therapy early during treatment. We outline an approach that evaluates tumor activity via statistical analysis of vessel shape using vessels segmented from MRA. This report is the first to describe the changes in vessel shape that occur during treatment of metastatic brain tumors as assessed by sequential MRA. In this preliminary study of 16 patients undergoing treatment for metastatic breast cancer we conclude that vessel shape may predict tumor response several months in advance of traditional methods.,0
Ten-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial of adjuvant clodronate treatment in node-positive breast cancer patients.,"Ten-year follow-up results are presented of an adjuvant clodronate trial in patients with primary breast cancer. Between 1990 and 1993, 299 women with primary node positive breast cancer were randomized to oral clodronate 1600 mg daily (149) or controls (150) for 3 years. All patients received adjuvant chemo- or endocrine therapy. Within 10 years bone metastases were detected at the same frequency in the clodronate and control groups: 44 (32%) vs. 42 (29%), respectively, (p=0.35). The frequency of non-skeletal recurrences (visceral and local) was significantly higher in the clodronate group 69 (50%) as compared with the controls 51 (36%) (p=0.005). Ten-year disease-free survival (DFS) remained significantly lower in the clodronate group (45% vs. 58%, p=0.01, respectively). This was especially seen in oestrogen receptor negative patients (25% vs. 58%, p=0.004, respectively). No significant overall survival difference was found between the groups. As previously reported 3-year adjuvant clodronate treatment did not prevent the development of bone metastases in node-positive breast cancer patients. A negative effect of clodronate on DFS by increasing the development of visceral metastases was still seen at 10 years, but this did not significantly compromise overall survival.",1
"Phase III randomized multicenter study on the effects of adjuvant CMF in patients with node-negative, rapidly proliferating breast cancer: twelve-year results and retrospective subgroup analysis.","The randomized multicenter study on rapidly proliferating breast cancer, assessed according to thymidine labelling index (TLI), was activated at the end of the 1980s. The present work investigated whether and to what degree the short-term advantages observed from adjuvant CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil) were maintained at a longer follow-up. Two hundred and eighty-one patients with node-negative and high TLI tumors were randomized to receive six cycles of CMF or no further treatment. At a median follow-up of 12 years, CMF produced a 25% and 20% relative reduction in relapse and death cumulative incidence, respectively. A breakdown analysis identified a subgroup of patients with intermediate proliferating tumors for whom a 70% and 73% reduction in relapse and death was observed in the intention-to-treat population. An even higher reduction of 80% and 84% in relapse and death was seen for the patients who had received the full CMF dose. We identified a subgroup of patients with intermediate proliferating tumors in whom the high benefit obtained from adjuvant CMF was maintained at a long-term follow up.",0
Rapid hematopoietic recovery after multicycle high-dose chemotherapy: enhancement of filgrastim-induced progenitor-cell mobilization by recombinant human stem-cell factor.,"PURPOSE: To assess the mobilization potential and safety of recombinant human stem-cell factor (SCF) when coadministered with filgrastim to untreated women with poor-prognosis breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible women had breast cancer with 10 or more positive axillary nodes, or estrogen receptor-negative tumor with 4 positive nodes, or stage III disease. Patients were randomized to receive SCF plus filgrastim or filgrastim alone. Filgrastim 12 microg/kg daily was administered for 6 days by continuous subcutaneous infusion. SCF was administered by daily subcutaneous injection at 5, 10, or 15 microg/kg concurrent with filgrastim for 7 days, or 10 microg/kg daily starting 3 days before filgrastim for a total of 10 days (SCF pretreatment). Apheresis was performed on days 5, 6, and 7 of filgrastim administration. Patients then had three cycles of epirubicin 200 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 4 g/m2 every 28 days, each supported by one third of the apheresis product. RESULTS: Sixty-two women were treated. Greater yields occurred in patients who received SCF 10 microg/kg daily plus filgastim than those who received filgrastim alone (P=.013 for CD34+ cells; P=.07 for granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells [GM-CFCs]). The difference was more marked with SCF-pretreatment than concurrent SCF. Fewer aphereses were required to reach the predetermined target of peripheral-blood progenitor/stem cells (PBPCs) in women who received SCF. SCF was generally well tolerated. Hematologic recovery was rapid after each of the three cycles of chemotherapy. There was no difference in recovery between the different treatment groups. CONCLUSION: Mobilization of PBPCs by filgrastim is significantly enhanced by coadministration of SCF, and commencing SCF before filgrastim can optimize this effect. SCF has the potential to reduce the number of aphereses required to collect a target number of PBPCs.",0
Acupressure for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting: a randomized clinical trial.,"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To compare differences in the chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) among three groups of women (acupressure, placebo acupressure, and usual care) undergoing chemo-therapy for breast cancer. DESIGN: A multicenter, longitudinal, randomized clinical trial throughout one cycle of chemotherapy. SETTING: Ten community clinical oncology programs associated with the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and nine independent sites located throughout the United States. SAMPLE: 160 women who were beginning their second or third cycle of chemotherapy for breast cancer treatment and had moderate nausea intensity scores with their previous cycles. METHODS: Subjects were randomized to one of three groups: acupressure to P6 point (active), acupressure to SI3 point (placebo), or usual care only. Subjects in the acupressure group were taught to apply an acupressure wrist device by research assistants who were unaware of the active acupressure point. All subjects completed a daily log for 21 days containing measures of nausea and vomiting and recording methods (including antiemetics and acupressure) used to control these symptoms. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Acute and delayed nausea and vomiting. RESULTS: No significant differences existed in the demographic, disease, or treatment variables among the treatment groups. No significant differences were found in acute nausea or emesis by treatment group. With delayed nausea and vomiting, the acupressure group had a statistically significant reduction in the amount of vomiting and the intensity of nausea over time when compared with the placebo and usual-care groups. No significant differences were found between the placebo and usual-care groups in delayed nausea or vomiting. CONCLUSIONS: Acupressure at the P6 point is a value-added technique in addition to pharmaceutical management for women undergoing treatment for breast cancer to reduce the amount and intensity of delayed CINV. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Acupressure is a safe and effective tool for managing delayed CINV and should be offered to women undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer.",0

Prognostic value of c-erbB2 overexpression in axillary lymph node positive breast cancer. Results from a randomized adjuvant treatment protocol.,"BACKGROUND: This study was designed to evaluate the prognostic importance of c-erbB2 overexpression in a standardized cohort of patients with axillary lymph node positive breast cancer. METHODS: Paraffin embedded primary breast cancers from 354 patients with axillary lymph node positive breast cancer, treated on a North Central Cancer Treatment Group adjuvant protocol, were studied immunohistochemically. c-erbB2 staining was classified as negative, weak (1+), moderate (2+), or strong (3+) and was assessed for effectiveness as a predictor of outcome in univariate and Cox model multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Twenty percent of specimens exhibited moderate or strong c-erbB2 staining. The median disease free survival period of the strong staining group was 2.9 years, compared with 7.1 years for all other patients (P = 0.01). The median overall survival for the strong staining group was 5 years, compared with 12 years for all other patients (P = 0.03). A definite correlation was noted between degree of nodal involvement and the likelihood of strong c-erbB2 staining (P = 0.001). There was also a significant correlation between c-erbB2 staining and higher nuclear grade and estrogen receptor negativity. In a multivariate analysis, c-erbB2 staining was not a significant predictor of either disease free survival or overall survival. CONCLUSION: According to this analysis, the strong correlation between c-erbB2 expression and degree of nodal involvement, higher grade disease, and estrogen receptor negativity suggests expression of this protooncogene product in a biologically more aggressive form of breast cancer. In a multivariate analysis, c-erbB2 expression was not an independent prognostic factor. Thus, c-erbB2 assessment did not appear to add significantly to the information provided by currently available standard disease parameters.",0
"A randomised trial of goserelin versus control after adjuvant, risk-adapted chemotherapy in premenopausal patients with primary breast cancer - GABG-IV B-93.","GABG-IV B-93 is a prospective, randomised study comparing goserelin (n=384) with no further treatment (n=392) in hormone receptor (HR)-negative breast cancer patients (n=465) after 3 cycles cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil (CMF) for patients with 0-3 positive lymph nodes (LN) or 4 cycles epirubicin, cyclophosphamide (EC) followed by 3 cycles CMF for patients with 4-9 positive LN. After completion of the ZEBRA trial the study was amended to enrol also HR-positive patients with 1-9+LN (n=311). After a median follow-up of 4.7 years neither HR-negative nor HR-positive patients showed a benefit for goserelin. The adjusted estimated hazard ratio for event-free survival in HR-negative patients was 1.01 (goserelin versus control, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72-1.42, P=0.97) and 0.77 in HR-positive patients (95% CI 0.47-1.24, P=0.27). These results do not support the general use of goserelin after adjuvant chemotherapy in this group of premenopausal patients.",1
Combined endocrine treatment of postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer. A randomized trial of tamoxifen vs. tamoxifen plus aminoglutethimide and hydrocortisone.,"The therapeutic efficacy of combined endocrine therapy with tamoxifen, aminoglutethimide and hydrocortisone (T+AG+H) was evaluated against treatment with tamoxifen (T) alone in 210 patients above 65 years of age with metastatic breast cancer. The treatment results have been assessed for the 166 fully evaluable patients and were the following for the T and T+AG+H groups, respectively: PD: 31 and 35%; NC: 35 and 37%; PR: 13 and 16%; and CR: 21 and 12%. The overall treatment results are not statistically different (p = 0.35) and the 95% C.L. of the difference of the response rates are -8% to +20%. The median duration of remission was approximately 24 months in both treatment groups (p = 0.31). The time to treatment failure was comparable with median values of 10 and 8 months in the T and the T+AG+H groups respectively (p = 0.17). Toxicity was more frequent and severe in the combined treatment group and could in most instances be attributed to treatment with AG+H. In conclusion, the simultaneous use of T and AG and H does not seem to improve the therapeutic results in postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer.",1
A single perioperative adjuvant chemotherapy course for node-negative breast cancer: five-year results of trial V. International Breast Cancer Study Group (formerly Ludwig Group).,"Twelve hundred seventy-five patients who were defined as having node-negative breast cancer were evaluated in a randomized trial that compared a single cycle of combination chemotherapy started within 36 hours of surgery (848 patients) with no adjuvant treatment (427 patients). The chemotherapy consisted of intravenous cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil given on days 1 and 8. Leucovorin (given on days 2 and 9) was added to the regimen to decrease severe toxic effects attributed to drug interaction between nitrous oxide used in anesthesia and methotrexate given in the immediate postoperative period. At a median follow-up of 60 months, the 5 year disease-free survival (DFS) percentages (+/- SE) were 74% +/- 2% for the treated group, and 68% +/- 2% for the no adjuvant therapy group. The estimated hazard ratio [95% confidence interval (CI)] was 0.78 (0.63 to 0.96); P = .02, representing a 22% +/- 9% relative reduction in the risk of relapse. The overall survival (OS) difference was not statistically significant with 5-year OS percentages of 88% +/- 1% for the treated group, and 85% +/- 2% for the control group [estimated hazard ratio (95% CI) = 0.85 (0.62 to 1.16); P = .31]. A subgroup analysis by menopausal status and by estrogen-receptor (ER) status revealed that the treatment effect was largest among the postmenopausal women with ER-negative tumors. The 5-year DFS percentages were 79% +/- 4% and 56% +/- 7%, and the OS percentages were 91% +/- 3% and 70% +/- 6%, for the treated and control groups, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1
"The effect of tamoxifen on the endometrium, serum lipids and hypothalamus pituitary axis in the postmenopausal breast cancer patients.","BACKGROUND: There is still no cost-effective endometrial screening method for asymptomatic postmenopausal breast cancer patients using tamoxifen. We investigated the effectivity of transvaginal ultrasonography and endometrial sampling as a screening method for asymptomatic patients. Additionally the effect of tamoxifen on hypothalamus-pituitary axis and serum lipid profiles were investigated. METHODS: Sixty-seven gynecologically asymptomatic postmenopausal breast cancer patients were enrolled in this randomized crossover study. Endometrial thickness was determined by transvaginal ultrasonography, endometrial biopsy was obtained by Pipelle or fractional curettage, hormone and lipid profiles were compared in the two groups which consisted of forty-seven tamoxifen user (cases) and twenty nonuser (controls) patients. RESULTS: The mean endometrial thickness measured by transvaginal sonography was 7.8 mm (3-20 mm) versus 3.7 mm respectively. The difference was significant in tamoxifen users. The most common histopathologic finding was endometrial polyp, detected in five patients. In the control group there was no endometrial polyp. The positive histopathologic findings were present in twenty-two patients in the case group but there were only two patients with positive histopathologic findings in the control group. Ultrasound findings did not correlate with the presence of endometrial abnormalities on biopsy and no endometrial cancer or hyperplasia were detected. In tamoxifen users serum FSH and LH levels were significantly lower than in nonusers. Serum HDL levels were significantly higher in the case group. CONCLUSION: Ultrasonographic imaging of the endometrium in asymptomatic postmenopausal breast cancer patients using tamoxifen should be interpreted with caution. Other imaging techniques should be used for more specific information about the endometrium.",0
Positron emission tomography studies in patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer: a method for early therapy evaluation?,"PURPOSE: To investigate if sequential positron emission tomographic (PET) scans with the glucose analog 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18FDG) and/or L-methyl-11C-methionine (11C-methionine) in patients with breast cancer could provide early information on the efficacy of polychemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with breast cancer (11 with locally advanced tumors, three with recurrent disease in the contralateral breast, two of them with distant and regional metastases, and two with distant metastases) underwent a baseline and two follow-up PET scans after the first and third/fourth polychemotherapy course. Tumor response was determined clinically/radiographically after three/four polychemotherapy courses. RESULTS: Five patients were investigated with 18FDG, seven with both 11C-methionine and 18FDG, and four with only 11C-methionine before polychemotherapy. 11C-methionine presented a more distinct visualization of primary/contralateral breast cancers in five of seven patients when compared with 18FDG. Twelve of 16 patients demonstrated a response using conventional methods after the third/fourth course of polychemotherapy. Eight of these 12 clinical responders had a significant decrease in tracer uptake at the first PET scan performed 6 to 13 days after the first polychemotherapy course, and these reductions were further augmented after the third/fourth course and corresponded to the conventional therapy evaluation (clinical examination, computed tomography [CT], ultrasonography, and mammography). CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that PET may be of clinical value in predicting response to chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced breast cancer and/or metastatic disease earlier than any other method used.",0
Capecitabine in addition to anthracycline- and taxane-based neoadjuvant treatment in patients with primary breast cancer: phase III GeparQuattro study.,"PURPOSE Capecitabine can be integrated either concomitantly or sequentially to anthracycline-plus-taxane-based regimens. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with large operable or locally advanced tumors, with hormone receptor-negative tumors, or with receptor-positive tumors but also clinically node-positive disease were recruited to receive preoperatively four cycles of epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide (EC; epirubicin 90 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2)). Patients were then randomly assigned to four cycles of docetaxel (100 mg/m(2)), four cycles of docetaxel + capecitabine (TX; docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) plus capecitabine 1,800 mg/m(2)), or four cycles of docetaxel (75 mg/m(2)) followed by four cycles of capecitabine (1,800 mg/m(2); T-X). Patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) -positive tumors received trastuzumab concomitantly with all cycles. Primary objectives were to assess the effect of docetaxel by comparing EC plus docetaxel versus EC plus TX and to assess the effect of duration by comparing EC plus TX versus EC plus T-X on pathologic complete response (pCR, without invasive/noninvasive breast tumor, regardless of nodal status) at surgery, irrespective of trastuzumab treatment. Results Of 1,509 patients starting EC, 1,421 were randomly assigned to docetaxel (n = 471), TX (n = 471), or T-X (n = 479). At surgery, pCR rates were 22.3%, 19.5%, and 22.3%, respectively; the difference for docetaxel (EC plus docetaxel v EC plus TX) was 2.8% (95% CI, -2.4% to 8.0%; P = .298).The difference for duration was -2.8% (95% CI, -8.0% to 2.4%; P = .298). Breast conservation rates were 70.1%, 68.4%, and 65.3%, respectively (P = .781 for docetaxel; P = .270 for duration). Concomitant but not sequential treatment with docetaxel was associated with more diarrhea; nail changes, and hand-foot-syndrome, but it was associated with less edema. CONCLUSION Adding capecitabine to or prolonging duration of neoadjuvant EC plus docetaxel does not result in higher efficacy at surgery.",1
Effects of clonidine on postoperative nausea and vomiting in breast cancer surgery.,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is still common, especially among female patients. Our hypothesis is that coinduction with clonidine reduces the incidence of PONV in adult patients undergoing breast cancer surgery. METHODS: Sixty-eight women premedicated with midazolam were randomly allocated to coinduction with intravenous clonidine (group C) or placebo (group P) in this prospective, double-blind study. Anesthesia was standardized (laryngeal mask airway, fentanyl, propofol, sevoflurane, nitrous oxide, and oxygen). Hemodynamic parameters and the requirements for propofol, sevoflurane, and the postoperative need for ketobemidone were noted. The primary endpoints studied were the number of PONV-free patients and patient satisfaction with respect to PONV. RESULTS: Patients in group C had a significantly reduced need for propofol (P < 0.04) and sevoflurane (P < 0.01) and a reduced early need for ketobemidone (P < 0.04). There were significantly more PONV-free patients in group C compared with group P (20 and 11 of 30, respectively; P < 0.04). The number needed to treat was 3.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.8, 16.9). Intraoperative blood pressure, postoperative heart rate, and postoperative blood pressure were all significantly lower in group C compared with group P, but were not considered to be of clinical importance. No negative side effects were recorded. CONCLUSION: Coinduction with clonidine significantly increased the number of PONV-free patients after breast cancer surgery with general anesthesia.",0
Postsurgical adjuvant chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy in women with breast cancer and positive axillary nodes: a South-Eastern Cancer Study Group (SEG) Trial.,"In a prospective study of 622 women with breast cancer, those with one to three histologically positive axillary lymph nodes were randomised after mastectomy to receive cyclophosphamide 100 mg/m2 orally on days 1-14, methotrexate 40 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1 and 8, and fluorouracil 600 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1 and 8 every 28 days for six cycles (CMF x six), or for twelve cycles of the same chemotherapy (CMF x 12). Those with > or = four positive nodes were randomised to one of these two groups or to 5000 cGy of postmastectomy regional radiotherapy (RT) followed by six cycles of the same chemotherapy (RT + CMF x six). With about 10 years median follow-up, there was no significant difference in survival or disease-free survival among the three groups. There was evidence of decreased locoregional recurrence in patients with > or = four nodes who received RT + CMF x six (relative risk 0.53, P = 0.067). Multivariate analysis indicated that the presence of > or = four positive nodes (negatively) and the percentage of ideal (full) dose of CMF received (positively) were the strongest factors predictive of survival. This study shows no advantage for 12 over six cycles of CMF chemotherapy in women with breast cancer and positive axillary nodes. There was a suggestion of decreased locoregional recurrence but no improvement in survival with radiotherapy for women with > or = four positive nodes.",0
"Tamoxifen vs Tamoxifen plus 13-cis-retinoic acid vs Tamoxifen plus Interferon alpha-2a as first-line endocrine treatments in advanced breast cancer: updated results of a phase II, prospective, randomised multicentre trial.","AIMS AND BACKGROUND: To demonstrate the efficacy of 13-cis-retinoic acid (RA) or Interferon alpha-2a (IFN alpha-2a) with Tamoxifen (TAM) in the treatment of advanced breast cancer. METHODS: Ninety-nine postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer, and a positive or unknown estrogen (ER) or progesterone (PgR) receptor status, were randomised to receive TAM 20 mg/m2/day orally (arm A), or TAM plus RA 1 mg/kg/day orally (arm B), or TAM plus IFN alpha-2a 3 MU thrice a week intramuscular (arm C). The three treatment groups were well balanced in terms of the main prognostic factors. RESULTS: Response was evaluable in 32 of the patients in arm A, 32 in arm B, and 30 in arm C. Intention-to-treat analysis showed no significant difference of response rate in the three arms (44% vs 38% vs 42%). After an eight years median follow-up, there was no significant between-group difference in median overall survival: 47.4 vs 38.2 vs 45.1 months. Side effects were negligible in arm A, but cutaneous (39%) and mucosal (62%) toxicities were frequent in arm B, and flu-like syndrome and/or myalgia (46%) in arm C. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of RA or IFN alpha-2a does not add anything to the therapeutic effects of TAM.",1
Double-blind placebo-controlled randomised trial of vitamin E and pentoxifylline in patients with chronic arm lymphoedema and fibrosis after surgery and radiotherapy for breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Treatment-induced arm lymphoedema is a common and distressing complication of curative surgery and radiotherapy for early breast cancer. A number of studies testing alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) and pentoxifylline suggest evidence of clinical regression of superficial radiation-induced fibrosis but there is only very limited evidence from randomised trials. Arm lymphoedema after lymphatic radiotherapy and surgery has been used in the present study as a clinical system for testing these drugs in a double-blind placebo-controlled randomised phase II trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-eight eligible research volunteers with a minimum 20% increase in arm volume at a median 15.5 years (range 2-41) after axillary/supraclavicular radiotherapy (plus axillary surgery in 51/68 (75%) cases) were randomised to active drugs or placebo. All volunteers were given dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate 500 mg twice a day orally plus pentoxifylline 400 mg twice a day orally, or corresponding placebos, for 6 months. The primary endpoint was volume of the ipsilateral limb measured opto-electronically using a perometer and expressed as a percentage of the contralateral limb volume. RESULTS: At 12 months post-randomisation, there was no significant difference between treatment and control groups in terms of arm volume. Absolute change in arm volume at 12 months was 2.5% (95% CI -0.40 to 5.3) in the treatment group compared to 1.2% (95% CI -2.8 to 5.1) in the placebo group. The difference in mean volume change between randomisation groups at 12 months was not statistically significant (P = 0.6), -1.3% (95% CI -6.1 to 3.5), nor was there a significant difference in response at 6 months (P = 0.7), where mean change in arm volume from baseline in the treatment and placebo groups was -2.3% (95% CI -7.9 to 3.4) and -1.1% (95% CI -3.9 to 1.7), respectively. There were no significant differences between randomised groups in terms of secondary endpoints, including tissue induration (fibrosis) in the irradiated breast or chest wall, pectoral fold or supraclavicular fossa, change in photographic breast/chest wall appearance or patient self-assessment of function and Quality of Life at either 6 or 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: The study fails to demonstrate efficacy of dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate plus pentoxifylline in patients with arm lymphoedema following axillary surgery and lymphatic radiotherapy, nor does it suggest any benefits of these drugs in radiation-induced induration (fibrosis) in the breast, chest wall, pectoral fold, axilla or supraclavicular fossa.",0
Significant impairment in immune recovery after cancer treatment.,"BACKGROUND: Although immunosuppression from cancer adjuvant therapy has been documented, how these suppressed immune responses recover to baseline values after completion of cancer adjuvant therapy has not been studied systematically.OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to examine the probability of immune recovery after cancer adjuvant therapy and the potential impact of cancer adjuvant therapy type and cancer stage on immune recovery in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer.METHODS: In a repeated-measures design, immune responses were measured four times in 80 patients with early-stage breast cancer: before and at 2, 6, and 12 months from the beginning of cancer adjuvant therapy. Natural killer cell activity, lymphokine-activated killer cell activity, lymphocyte proliferation, CD subsets (CD4, CD8, and CD56), and cytokines (interferon-gamma, interleukin [IL]-2, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-1alpha) were selected for their relevance to breast cancer. Immune recovery was defined by the level of immune response reaching to and above baseline levels. Data were analyzed using a multivariate generalized linear mixed-model approach.RESULTS: Delayed immune recovery to pretreatment baseline levels continued to the 12-month time point in all parameters. The percentages of immune recovery ranged from 6% to 76% of the patients, varying among immune parameters. Overall, immune recovery was poorer for interferon-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, lymphocyte proliferation, and natural killer cell activity than was for CD subsets and IL-6. The type of cancer adjuvant therapy, not cancer stage, showed selective influence on immune recovery. Chemotherapy or chemotherapy and radiotherapy combination significantly delayed IL-2 recovery, whereas radiotherapy significantly delayed IL-4 recovery.DISCUSSION: Immune recovery after breast cancer adjuvant therapy is delayed significantly for an extended time period in numerous immune parameters. The type of cancer adjuvant therapy has selective influence on immune recovery. Future investigations are warranted to elucidate the time course of immune recovery, clinical significance of poor immune recovery, and factors influencing immune recovery to develop potential interventions.",0
Palliative pamidronate treatment in patients with bone metastases from breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: An open, randomized study was performed to assess the effects of supportive pamidronate treatment on morbidity from bone metastases in breast cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-one pamidronate patients and 80 control patients were monitored for a median of 18 and 21 months, respectively, for events of skeletal morbidity and the radiologic course of metastatic bone disease. The oral pamidronate dose was 600 mg/d (high dose [HD]) during the earliest study years, then changed to 300 mg/d (low dose [LD]) because of gastrointestinal toxicity. Twenty-nine of 81 pamidronate (HD/LD) patients first received 600 mg/d and were then changed to 300 mg/d; 52 of 81 pamidronate LD patients received 300 mg/d throughout the study. Tumor treatment was unrestricted. RESULTS: An overall intent-to-treat analysis was performed. In the pamidronate group, the occurrence of hypercalcemia, severe bone pain, and symptomatic impending fractures decreased by 65%, 30%, and 50%, respectively; event-rates of systemic treatment and radiotherapy decreased by 35% (P < or = .02). The event-free period (EFP), radiologic course of disease, and survival did not improve. Subgroup analyses suggested a dose-dependent treatment effect. Compared with their controls, in pamidronate HD/LD patients, events occurred 60% to 90% less frequently (P < or = .03) and the EFP was prolonged (P = .002). In pamidronate LD patients, event-rates decreased by 15% to 45% (P < or = .04). Gastrointestinal toxicity of pamidronate caused a 23% drop-out rate, but other cancer-associated factors seemed to contribute to this toxicity. CONCLUSION: Pamidronate treatment of breast cancer patients efficaciously reduced skeletal morbidity. The effect appeared to be dose-dependent. Further research on dose and mode of treatment is mandatory.",0
Clinical efficacy of rhIL-11.,"Placebo-controlled clinical trials of recombinant human interleukin-11 (rhIL-11, also known as oprelvekin [Neumega]) in patients with nonmyeloid malignancies have demonstrated significant efficacy in preventing postchemotherapy platelet nadirs of < or = 20,000/microL, and reducing the need for platelet transfusions while continuing chemotherapy without dose reductions. The likelihood of requiring a platelet transfusion in rhIL-11-treated patients receiving chemotherapy is approximately 40% lower than the risk for untreated patients. Treatment with rhIL-11 appears to accelerate earlier recovery to platelet counts of 20,000/microL, 50,000/microL, and 100,000/microL, suggesting that patients treated with rhIL-11 are more likely to be able to receive their next chemotherapy cycle in a timely fashion. rhIL-11 shows sustained efficacy over multiple cycles of full-dose chemotherapy. Activity has also been demonstrated in pediatric patients with solid tumors. The use of rhIL-11 in combination with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF, filgrastim [Neupogen]) may also produce a synergistic hematopoietic effect, resulting in earlier neutrophil recovery. The recommended adult dose regimen for rhIL-11 is 50 micrograms/kg administered subcutaneously once daily beginning 6 to 24 hours after the administration of chemotherapy until a postnadir platelet count of > or = 50,000/microL is reached. The recommended pediatric dose of rhIL-11 is 75 micrograms/kg subcutaneously, once daily beginning 6 to 24 hours after the administration of chemotherapy until a postnadir platelet count of > or = 50,000/microL is reached. The administration of rhIL-11 for greater than 21 days has not been studied and therefore is not recommended.",0
Adjuvant clodronate treatment does not reduce the frequency of skeletal metastases in node-positive breast cancer patients: 5-year results of a randomized controlled trial.,"PURPOSE: Bisphosphonates have effectively reduced the development and progression of bone metastases in advanced breast cancer. The aim of this study was to determine whether bone metastases could be prevented by adjuvant clodronate treatment in patients with primary breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1990 and 1993, 299 women with primary node-positive breast cancer were randomized to clodronate (n = 149) or control groups (n = 150). Clodronate 1,600 mg daily was given orally for 3 years. All patients received adjuvant therapy: premenopausal six cycles of CMF chemotherapy and postmenopausal antiestrogens (randomized to tamoxifen 20 mg or toremifene 60 mg/d for 3 years). Seventeen patients were excluded from the analyses because of major protocol violations. The final population was 282 patients. Intent-to-treat analyses were also performed for all major end points. The follow-up time was 5 years for all patients. RESULTS: Bone metastases were detected equally often in the clodronate and control groups: 29 patients (21%) versus 24 patients (17%) (P: = .27). The development of nonskeletal recurrence was significantly higher in the clodronate group compared with controls: 60 patients (43%) versus 36 patients (25%) (P: = .0007). The overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were also significantly lower in the clodronate group than in the controls (OS, 70% v 83%, P: = .009; DFS, 56% v 71%, P: = .007, respectively). In multivariate analyses, clodronate remained significantly associated with DFS (P: = .009). CONCLUSION: Adjuvant clodronate treatment does not prevent the development of bone metastases in node-positive breast cancer patients. However, clodronate seems to have a negative effect on DFS by increasing the development of nonskeletal metastases.",0
Timing of CMF chemotherapy in combination with tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with breast cancer: role of endocrine responsiveness of the tumor.,"BACKGROUND: Controversy persists about whether chemotherapy benefits all breast cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the International Breast Cancer Study Group (IBCSG) trial VII, 1212 postmenopausal patients with node-positive disease were randomized to receive tamoxifen for 5 years or tamoxifen plus three concurrent courses of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil ('classical' CMF) chemotherapy, either early, delayed or both. In IBCSG trial IX, 1669 postmenopausal patients with node-negative disease were randomized to receive either tamoxifen alone or three courses of adjuvant classical CMF prior to tamoxifen. Results were assessed according to estrogen receptor (ER) content of the primary tumor. RESULTS: For patients with node-positive, ER-positive disease, adding CMF either early, delayed or both reduced the risk of relapse by 21% (P=0.06), 26% (P=0.02) and 25% (P=0.02), respectively, compared with tamoxifen alone. There was no difference in disease-free survival when CMF was given prior to tamoxifen in patients with node-negative, ER-positive tumors. CONCLUSIONS: CMF given concurrently (early, delayed or both) with tamoxifen was more effective than tamoxifen alone for patients with node-positive, endocrine-responsive breast cancer, supporting late administration of chemotherapy even after commencement of tamoxifen. In contrast, sequential CMF and tamoxifen for patients with node-negative, endocrine-responsive disease was ineffective.",0
Prognostic and predictive factors for patients with metastatic breast cancer undergoing aggressive induction therapy followed by high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem-cell support.,"PURPOSE: We performed a retrospective review to determine predictive and prognostic factors in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received induction therapy, and, if they responded to treatment, high-dose chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with metastatic breast cancer received induction therapy with doxorubicin, fluorouracil, and methotrexate (AFM). Partial responders then received immediate high-dose chemotherapy, whereas those who achieved complete remission were randomized to immediate or delayed high-dose chemotherapy with hematopoietic stem-cell support. We performed a retrospective review of data from these patients and used Cox proportional hazards regression models for analyses. RESULTS: The overall response rate for the 425 patients enrolled was 74% (95% confidence interval, 70% to 78%). Multivariate analysis of data from all 425 patients revealed that positive estrogen receptor status (P =.0041), smaller metastatic foci (</= 2 v > 2 cm) (P =. 0165), a longer disease-free interval from initial diagnosis to diagnosis of metastases (</= 2 v > 2 years) (P =.0051), and prior treatment with tamoxifen (P =.0152) were good prognostic signs for overall survival. Patients who had received prior adjuvant therapy (P =.0001) and those who developed liver metastases (P =.0001) had decreased long-term survival. In the subgroup of responders to AFM induction, multivariate analysis showed that those with visceral metastases did less well (P =.0006), as did patients who had received prior adjuvant therapy (P =.0023). However, those who had received tamoxifen therapy in the adjuvant setting did better (P =. 0143). CONCLUSION: The chance for long-term remission with induction therapy with AFM and high-dose chemotherapy is increased for hormone receptor positive-patients with nonvisceral metastases who have not received prior adjuvant chemotherapy and have long disease-free intervals.",0
A randomised trial of second-line hormone vs single agent chemotherapy in tamoxifen resistant advanced breast cancer.,"Sixty patients with advanced breast cancer unresponsive to tamoxifen have been randomised to receive four course of mitozantrone, 14 mg m-2 (n = 30) intravenously every 3 weeks (9 weeks total) or megesterol acetate, 160 mg bd (n = 30). One in three patients (11 from each group) had substantial disease control for a minimum period of 6 months i.e., lack of progression; seven patients (23%) showed objective response to mitozantrone compared to four (13%) receiving megesterol. Non-progressive disease occurred in all sites, including visceral metastases and receptor negative patients. There were no significant differences between treatment groups in the median time (5 months each) to disease progression response duration or survival (13 months megesterol, 11 months mitozantrone) from commencing second-line therapy. Toxicity was considerably higher in the mitozantrone group. Second-line hormonal therapies can produce similar therapeutic results as those achieved from a short course of a 'short option' single agent cytotoxic in patients who were previously thought hormone insensitive. Provided that the patient does not have life threatening disease a trial of megesterol acetate is worth consideration in that it does not prejudice subsequent response to combination cytotoxic chemotherapy.",1
Capecitabine plus docetaxel combination therapy.,"BACKGROUND: For patients with anthracycline-pretreated metastatic breast carcinoma, capecitabine plus docetaxel significantly increased overall survival compared with docetaxel alone. The current study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the capecitabine/docetaxel combination versus docetaxel monotherapy, comparing the gain in quality-adjusted survival with associated health care costs. METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive 21-day cycles of oral capecitabine 1250 mg/m2 twice daily, on Days 1-14, plus docetaxel 75 mg/m2 Day 1 (n = 255), or docetaxel 100 mg/m2 on Day 1 (n = 256). Health and cost outcomes in the two arms were compared, and cost-effectiveness was estimated. Data on survival time and medical care resource use were prospectively collected in the trial. Costs associated with medical care resource use and quality-of-life adjustments were obtained from the published literature. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated as the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: Capecitabine/docetaxel increased the median overall survival by 3 months compared with docetaxel alone (14.5 vs. 11.5 months). The mean quality-adjusted survival was increased by 1.8 months in the capecitabine/docetaxel group. The total medical-resource utilization cost per patient was 8.9% higher with the combination: 24,475 dollars for combination therapy versus 22,477 dollars for single-agent docetaxel. The mean cost per QALY gained with combination therapy was 13,558 dollars (standard deviation, 6742 dollars). Cost savings due to reduced docetaxel dose and hospital use were the major cost offsets with the combination. Sensitivity analyses showed that varying the mean hospital cost per day from the 5th to the 95th percentile resulted in cost-utility ratios ranging from 20,326 dollars to as low as 6360 dollars. CONCLUSIONS: Capecitabine/docetaxel was a cost-effective treatment in patients with anthracycline-pretreated advanced breast carcinoma, and had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio that compares very favorably with that of many other oncology therapies.",1
Antiproliferative effects of idoxifene in a placebo-controlled trial in primary human breast cancer.,"Idoxifene is a novel selective estrogen receptor modulator. It has reduced agonist activity on breast and uterine cells compared with tamoxifen and antiproliferative effects in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells. Previous studies have shown that a short course of treatment with other antiestrogens prior to surgery caused a significant reduction of the growth fraction when measured by immunohistological staining using the mouse monoclonal antibody Ki67. In this study, we assessed the effect of idoxifene on biological markers of cell proliferation (Ki67) and apoptosis (TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling), and estrogen and progesterone receptor (ER/PR) expression was also evaluated. Core-cut biopsies were obtained in 77 postmenopausal patients with primary breast cancer at diagnosis. Patients were randomized to 40 mg/day idoxifene or placebo for 14-21 days prior to obtaining a second biopsy sample at surgical resection. The percentage of Ki67-positive cells fell from a mean 19.7 +/- 2.7% (SE) to 13.4 +/- 3.4% in idoxifene-treated ER-positive tumors (n = 30; P = 0.0043), but there was no significant effect in placebo-treated ER-positive tumors (n = 27). No effect was seen on ER-negative tumors in either group. Idoxifene had no significant effect on apoptotic index but produced a statistically significant fall in idoxifene-treated ER immunohistochemical score and a small increase in PR that did not reach statistical significance (0.05 < P < 0.10). Idoxifene was well tolerated in all patients. Idoxifene has an antiproliferative effect in ER-positive but not ER-negative breast cancers, and no significant effect on apoptosis in the short-term.",0
Reduced morbidity from skeletal metastases in breast cancer patients during long-term bisphosphonate (APD) treatment.,"131 patients with osteolytic metastases from breast cancer were randomised to receive long-term oral treatment with aminohydroxy-propylidene-bisphosphonate (APD), 300 mg daily (n = 70), or to act as controls (n = 61) in a multicentre trial. Specific antitumour therapy was at the discretion of the clinician and variable. An interim analysis was made after a median follow-up of 13 months in the APD group and 14 months in the controls. There was a significant reduction in pathological fractures and severe bone pain in the APD group, and hypercalcaemia was prevented. Consequently the necessity for radiotherapy for skeletal complications was more than halved; the number of systemic therapy changes was also reduced. Gastrointestinal side-effects of APD led to a drop-out of 8% of patients. Oral supportive APD therapy is simple and convenient, and significantly reduced skeletal morbidity in advanced breast cancer.",0

Superiority of gas chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry assay (GC/MS/MS) for estradiol for monitoring of aromatase inhibitor therapy.,"Currently available radioimmunoassay methods for estradiol in serum lack sufficient sensitivity and precision to monitor estradiol levels in patients placed on third generation aromatase inhibitors. We recently validated a gas chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry assay (GC/MS/MS) for estradiol and determined estrogen levels in normal post-menopausal women and in women with breast cancer before and during administration of aromatase inhibitors. Validation of the GC/MS/MS assay in human plasma and human serum included determination of assay sensitivity (<0.63 pg/ml), precision (all CVs less than 17.8%), recovery (98-103%), and linearity of recovery (R=0.998). Levels of estradiol were lower when assayed by GC/MS/MS compared to RIA under all conditions (7.26+/-4.82 pg/ml versus 11.9+12.0 pg/ml in normal post-menopausal women; 5.88+/-3.43 pg/ml versus 13.8+/-7.5 pg/ml in breast cancer patients prior to treatment; and<0.63 pg/ml versus 5.8+/-4.1 pg/ml during aromatase inhibitor therapy). Fifty-five women treated either with atamestane/toremiphene or letrozole/placebo were monitored for estradiol levels at 4, 8 and 12 weeks of therapy. The mean levels of estradiol during aromatase inhibitor therapy was 5.8+/-4.1 pg/ml as measured by RIA and <0.63 pg/ml by GC/MS/MS. The degree of suppression with the aromatase inhibitors as detected by RIA was 58% versus >89% by GC/MS. These results suggest that most RIA methods detect cross-reacting estrogen metabolites and yield higher measured levels than GC/MS/MS. Several pharmacological and clinical considerations suggest that GC/MS/MS should become the preferred method for monitoring aromatase inhibitor therapy.",0
Phase III randomized comparison of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with 2-year oral uracil/tegafur versus 6-cycle cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/5-fluorouracil in high-risk node-negative breast cancer patients.,"The value of cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/5-fluorouracil (CMF)-type regimens in surgical adjuvant therapy in certain subsets of patients with axillary lymph node-negative breast cancer has been evaluated in Europe and the USA. However, Japan has a distinctive standpoint regarding the indications for surgical adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer patients. In addition, oral fluoropyrimidines are widely used to treat breast cancer patients in both adjuvant and metastatic settings due to their low toxicity and convenience for long-term administration. Although the antitumor activity and the ability to prolong disease-free survival times of oral fluoropyrimidines have been evaluated in patients with breast cancer, available data are not sufficient to justify replacing CMF-type regimens with oral fluoropyrimidines in postoperative chemotherapy for breast cancer patients. To evaluate the utility of oral fluoropyrimidines in surgical adjuvant chemotherapy, the National Surgical Adjuvant Study Group (N-SAS) was founded in 1995 as a government-funded research group, and nationwide multiinstitutional trials were designed for breast cancer as well as colon and gastric cancers. For high-risk, node-negative breast cancer patients, a prospective randomized trial of surgical adjuvant chemotherapy comparing 6 cycles of CMF with 2 years of daily uracil/tegafur (UFT) started in October 1996. The endpoints of this study include disease-free and overall survival, adverse reactions, quality of life, and cost.",0
Pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin administered i.v. as Myocet (TLC D-99; liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin citrate) compared with conventional doxorubicin when given in combination with cyclophosphamide in patients with metastatic breast cancer.,"Myocet (TLC D-99) is a liposomal formulation of the anti-neoplastic drug doxorubicin with an improved therapeutic index compared with conventional doxorubicin. The objective of this study was to assess the plasma disposition of doxorubicin when administered i.v. as TLC D-99 and to compare this to conventional drug. Metabolite (doxorubicinol) plasma levels were also quantitated in both treatment groups. Plasma was collected during the first course of treatment from 10 patients receiving TLC D-99 60 mg/m and 10 receiving conventional doxorubicin 60 mg/m2, each with cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2. Samples were assayed for total doxorubicin (all doxorubicin regardless of whether it is encapsulated or not), encapsulated doxorubicin (TLC D-99 group only) and doxorubicinol using high-performance liquid chromatography. Plasma concentrations of total doxorubicin were higher in patients receiving TLC D-99 than in patients receiving conventional doxorubicin. The clearance of total doxorubicin after administration of TLC D-99 was lower (approximately 9-fold) and the volume of distribution at steady state was less (25-fold) than that of doxorubicin after conventional drug. Doxorubicinol was detected in the plasma of all patients in both treatment groups. The mean AUC(0-infinity) of doxorubicinol for patients receiving TLC D-99 (1.5+/-0.4 M x h) was not statistically different than that in patients receiving conventional doxorubicin (1.8+/-0.4 M x h), although the appearance of the peak doxorubicinol concentration occurred later and was lower in patients receiving TLC D-99. There was a correlation between the plasma AUC(0-infinity) of total doxorubicin and the degree of myelosuppression in patients receiving conventional doxorubicin, but this correlation was not found in patients receiving TLC D-99.",1
FEC versus sequential docetaxel followed by epirubicin/cyclophosphamide as adjuvant chemotherapy in women with axillary node-positive early breast cancer: a randomized study of the Hellenic Oncology Research Group (HORG).,"A randomized multicenter phase III study was conducted to compare the sequential docetaxel followed by epirubicin/cyclophosphamide combination with that of FEC regimen as adjuvant chemotherapy in women with axillary node-positive early breast cancer. Seven hundred and fifty-six women with axillary lymph node-positive breast cancer were randomized to receive either 4 cycles of docetaxel (100 mg/m(2)) followed by 4 cycles of epirubicin (75 mg/m(2)) plus cyclophosphamide (700 mg/m(2)) (experimental arm) or 6 cycles of FEC (epirubicin 75 mg/m(2), cyclophosphamide 700 mg/m(2), and 5-fluorouracil 700 mg/m(2); control arm). All regimes were administered every 3 weeks. The primary end point was five-year disease-free survival (DFS). After a median follow-up period of 5 years, 233 (30.8%) relapses had occurred (108 and 125 in the experimental and control arms, respectively; P = 0.181). The five-year DFS was 72.6% (95% CI 63.8-81.3%) and 67.2% (95% CI 58.0-76.4%) for women randomized in the experimental and control arms, respectively (P = 0.041; log rank test). There was no difference in the overall survival between the two arms (83.8 and 81.4% in the experimental and control arms, respectively; P = 0.533). The experimental arm was associated with increased neutropenia requiring administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in 90.5% of the patients as compared with 74.1% in the control arm (P = 0.0001). The sequential docetaxel followed by epirubicin/cyclophosphamide adjuvant chemotherapy regimen resulted in improved five-year DFS in women with axillary node-positive early breast cancer at the expense of increased but manageable myelotoxicity.",1
Methodological issues in the investigation of ginseng as an intervention for fatigue.,"BACKGROUND: Although literature suggests that fatigue is commonly reported by women during and after breast cancer treatment, treatment options are limited. Although ginseng is widely used in Asian countries as a tonic to increase energy, its efficacy for treating cancer-related fatigue has not been carefully studied. We conducted a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of a larger clinical trial to investigate the efficacy of ginseng for treating breast cancer-related fatigue. PARTICIPANTS/METHODS: Breast cancer survivors seeking treatment for fatigue were recruited to participate in an 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. RESULTS: A variety of practical problems were encountered in the study, including large numbers of survivors with conditions that were possible contraindications to ginseng use, inability to achieve blinding for the intervention because of strong odor from the ginseng, and measurement device failure. DISCUSSION: Evaluating ginseng for breast cancer treatment-related fatigue is a great challenge, particularly if a blinded randomized design is desired. This article provides insight into issues related to investigating complementary therapies and the importance of pilot studies for identifying methodological problems.",0
"Fatigue, menopausal symptoms, and cognitive function in women after adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer: 1- and 2-year follow-up of a prospective controlled study.","PURPOSE: We previously evaluated fatigue, menopausal symptoms, and cognitive dysfunction in patients receiving adjuvant therapy for breast cancer and matched healthy women. Here we report assessment of these women 1 and 2 years later. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients without relapse and controls were evaluated by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment-General Quality of Life questionnaire, with subscales for fatigue and endocrine symptoms, and by the High Sensitivity Cognitive Screen. RESULTS: There were 104, 91, and 83 patients and 102, 81, and 81 controls assessed at baseline and at 1 and 2 years, respectively. Median Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment-Fatigue scores (range, 0 to 52) for patients improved from 31 (on chemotherapy) to 43 and 45 at 1 and 2 years, respectively, but were stable in controls (46 to 48). Median Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment-Endocrine Symptoms scores (range, 0 to 72) for patients improved from 57 (on chemotherapy) to 59 and 61 at 1 and 2 years, respectively, and were stable in controls (64 to 65). Differences between patients and controls remained significant for these scales. The incidence of moderate-severe cognitive dysfunction by the High Sensitivity Cognitive Screen decreased in patients from 16% (on chemotherapy) to 4.4% and 3.8% and in controls from 5% to 3.6% and 0% at 1 and 2 years, respectively. There were minimal differences between estrogen receptor-positive patients who started hormonal therapy (mainly tamoxifen) after chemotherapy and estrogen receptor-negative patients who did not. Differences in quality of life between patients and controls were significant only at baseline. CONCLUSION: Fatigue, menopausal symptoms, and cognitive dysfunction are important adverse effects of chemotherapy that improve in most patients. Hormonal treatment has minimal impact on them.",0
17ss-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 as predictor of tamoxifen response in premenopausal breast cancer.,"17ss-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (17HSDs) are involved in the local regulation of sex steroids. 17HSD1 converts oestrone (E1) to the more potent oestradiol (E2) and 17HSD2 catalyses the reverse reaction. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of these enzymes in premenopausal breast cancers and to analyse if they have any prognostic or tamoxifen predictive value. Premenopausal patients with invasive breast cancer, stage II (UICC), were randomised to either 2years of adjuvant tamoxifen (n=276) or no tamoxifen (n=288). The median follow-up was 13.9years (range 10.5-17.5). The expression of 17HSD1 and 17HSD2 was analysed with immunohistochemistry using tissue microarrays. The enzyme expression level (-/+/++/+++) was successfully determined in 396 and 373 tumours, respectively. Women with hormone-receptor positive tumours, with low levels (-/+/++) of 17HSD1, had a 43% reduced risk of recurrence, when treated with tamoxifen (Hazard Ratio (HR)=0.57; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.37-0.86; p=0.0086). On the other hand high expression (+++) of 17HSD1 was associated with no significant difference between the two treatment arms (HR=0.91; 95% CI, 0.43-1.95; p=0.82). The interaction between 17HSD1 and tamoxifen was significant during the first 5 years of follow-up (p=0.023). In the cohort of systemically untreated patients no prognostic importance was observed for 17HSD1. We found no predictive or prognostic value for 17HSD2. This is the first report of 17HSD1 in a cohort of premenopausal women with breast cancer randomised to tamoxifen. Our data suggest that 17HSD1 might be a predictive factor in this group of patients.",0
UFT plus oral calcium folinate/vinorelbine for advanced breast cancer.,"This phase I study was undertaken to define the maximum tolerated dose, dose-limiting toxicity, and recommended dosage of UFT (uracil and tegafur) plus oral calcium folinate (Orzel) and vinorelbine (Navelbine) in combination treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have received one prior chemotherapy regimen. The pharmacokinetics of UFT and vinorelbine were also evaluated. Starting doses were UFT 300 mg/day, plus a fixed calcium folinate dose of 90 mg/day, both administered in three divided daily doses on days 1 through 21 and vinorelbine 15 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15. The regimen was repeated every 4 weeks. At least three patients were treated at each dose level before escalating to the next level. Prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was not routinely given. The preliminary results are reported as we await further follow-up of this ongoing study.",1
"Randomized adjuvant chemotherapy trial in high-risk, lymph node-negative breast cancer patients identified by urokinase-type plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1.","BACKGROUND: Most patients with lymph node-negative breast cancer are cured by locoregional treatment; however, about 30% relapse. Because traditional histomorphologic and clinical factors fail to identify the high-risk patients who may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, other prognostic factors are needed. In a unicenter study, we have found that levels of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) in the primary tumor are predictive of disease recurrence. Thus, we designed the Chemo N(0) prospective randomized multicenter therapy trial to investigate further whether uPA and PAI-1 are such prognostic factors and whether high-risk patients identified by these factors benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. After 4.5 years, we present results of the first interim analysis. METHODS: We studied 556 patients with lymph node-negative breast cancer. The median follow-up was 32 months. All patients with low tumor levels of uPA (< or = 3 ng/mg of protein) and of PAI-1 (< or = 14 ng/mg of protein) were observed. Patients with high tumor levels of uPA (> 3 ng/mg of protein) and/or of PAI-1 (> 14 ng/mg of protein) were randomly assigned to combination chemotherapy or subjected to observation only. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: A total of 241 patients had low levels of uPA and PAI-1, and 315 had elevated levels of uPA and/or PAI-1. The estimated 3-year recurrence rate for patients with low tumor levels of uPA and PAI-1 (low-risk group) was 6.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.5% to 10.8%). This rate for patients with high tumor levels of uPA and/or PAI-1 (high-risk group) was 14.7% (95% CI = 8.5% to 20.9%) (P = 0.006). First interim analysis suggests that high-risk patients in the chemotherapy group benefit, with a 43.8% lower estimated probability of disease recurrence at 3 years than high-risk patients in the observation group (intention-to-treat analysis: relative risk = 0.56; 95% CI = 0.25 to 1.28), but further follow-up is needed for confirmation. CONCLUSIONS: Using uPA and PAI-1, we have been able to classify about half of the patients with lymph node-negative breast cancer as low risk, for whom adjuvant chemotherapy may be avoided, and half as high risk, who appear to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.",0
"Effect of subcutaneous recombinant human erythropoietin in cancer patients receiving radiotherapy: preliminary results of a randomized, open-labeled, phase II trial.","PURPOSE: To determine the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous administration of recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) at a dose of 200 units/kg/day to cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This is a randomized, open-labeled, Phase II study. Only patients receiving radiotherapy +/- chemotherapy are included. Eligibility is restricted to patients with lung cancer, carcinoma of the uterine cervix, prostatic adenocarcinoma, or adenocarcinoma of the breast. Patients in the control and treatment arms receive radiotherapy with similar policies, and their doses of radiotherapy and treatment volumes are determined by the site and stage of the disease. Patients in the ""treatment arm"" receive 200 units/kg/day of r-HuEPO, subcutaneously, five times a week with iron (Fe SO4, 325 mg. p.o., t.i.d.) supplements. Complete blood counts are obtained weekly. Quality of life is assessed weekly by the patients themselves by a few simple entries on an analog scale. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients have been entered in the study so far. Twelve patients were placed in the control arm and 14 in the treatment arm. Pre-randomization demographic and laboratory mean values in both arms were comparable, with none of 16 parameters compared reaching statistical significance. Our results can be summarized as follows: (a) Mean hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell values increased gradually in the treatment arm patients. Week-by-week comparison showed that mean values for these three parameters were significantly higher in the treatment arm than in the control arm. For example, the p values for the differences in hemoglobin mean values for weeks 1-6 were 0.015, 0.002, 0.003, 0.0002, 0.0006, and 0.007, respectively. Similar trends were observed for red blood cells and the hematocrit values. (b) No significant toxicity has been encountered. (c) No significant differences in the mean values of white blood cells and platelet counts were seen between the two arms. The values of these two parameters declined over the course of radiotherapy. (d) The mean weekly increase in hemoglobin levels in the treatment arm was 0.43 gm/dl. CONCLUSION: (a) The safety and efficacy of r-HuEPO, with 200 units/kg/day of subcutaneous administration, have been confirmed in our study group. (b) However, the rate of increase in hemoglobin levels is not very rapid with the doses used. (c) Dose escalation studies are needed for determination of the feasibility of improving hemoglobin levels by about 1 gm/dl/week. (d) The question whether improvement in hemoglobin with r-HuEPO therapy can improve outcome by improving tumor oxygenation needs to be studied in carcinoma of the uterine cervix and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.",0
"Adjuvant chemotherapy and timing of tamoxifen in postmenopausal patients with endocrine-responsive, node-positive breast cancer: a phase 3, open-label, randomised controlled trial.","BACKGROUND: Tamoxifen is standard adjuvant treatment for postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer. We assessed the benefit of adding chemotherapy to adjuvant tamoxifen and whether tamoxifen should be given concurrently or after chemotherapy.METHODS: We undertook a phase 3, parallel, randomised trial (SWOG-8814, INT-0100) in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive, node-positive breast cancer to test two major objectives: whether the primary outcome, disease-free survival, was longer with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF) given every 4 weeks for six cycles plus 5 years of daily tamoxifen than with tamoxifen alone; and whether disease-free survival was longer with CAF followed by tamoxifen (CAF-T) than with CAF plus concurrent tamoxifen (CAFT). Overall survival and toxicity were predefined, important secondary outcomes for each objective. Patients in this open-label trial were randomly assigned by a computer algorithm in a 2:3:3 ratio (tamoxifen:CAF-T:CAFT) and analysis was by intention to treat of eligible patients. Groups were compared by stratified log-rank tests, followed by Cox regression analyses adjusted for significant prognostic factors. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00929591.FINDINGS: Of 1558 randomised women, 1477 (95%) were eligible for inclusion in the analysis. After a maximum of 13 years of follow-up (median 8.94 years), 637 women had a disease-free survival event (tamoxifen, 179 events in 361 patients; CAF-T, 216 events in 566 patients; CAFT, 242 events in 550 patients). For the first objective, therapy with the CAF plus tamoxifen groups combined (CAFT or CAF-T) was superior to tamoxifen alone for the primary endpoint of disease-free survival (adjusted Cox regression hazard ratio [HR] 0.76, 95% CI 0.64-0.91; p=0.002) but only marginally for the secondary endpoint of overall survival (HR 0.83, 0.68-1.01; p=0.057). For the second objective, the adjusted HRs favoured CAF-T over CAFT but did not reach significance for disease-free survival (HR 0.84, 0.70-1.01; p=0.061) or overall survival (HR 0.90, 0.73-1.10; p=0.30). Neutropenia, stomatitis, thromboembolism, congestive heart failure, and leukaemia were more frequent in the combined CAF plus tamoxifen groups than in the tamoxifen-alone group.INTERPRETATION: Chemotherapy with CAF plus tamoxifen given sequentially is more effective adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal patients with endocrine-responsive, node-positive breast cancer than is tamoxifen alone. However, it might be possible to identify some subgroups that do not benefit from anthracycline-based chemotherapy despite positive nodes.FUNDING: National Cancer Institute (US National Institutes of Health).",1
Relationship between toxicity and obesity in women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer: results from cancer and leukemia group B study 8541.,"PURPOSE: We examined data from a large clinical trial to determine if chemotherapy dosing according to actual body weight places obese patients at greater risk of toxicity.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) study 8541, a randomized study of schedule and dose of adjuvant cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF) for stage II breast cancer patients with positive regional lymph nodes, provided data on 1,435 women for analysis. Using body-mass index (BMI), we classified a woman as obese if her BMI was > or = 27.3 kg/m2; doses were considered weight-based if within 5% of values calculated using actual weight. Our primary analysis concerned toxicity risks during cycle 1.RESULTS: Among women who received weight-based doses of the most dose-intensive CAF regimen, 47% of obese and 51% of nonobese women experienced severe hematologic toxicity (grade > or = 3) during cycle 1 (P = .51, two-tailed). The overall risk ratio (obese v nonobese) of treatment failure among women who received weight-based doses during cycle 1 was 1.02 (95% confidence interval, 0.83 to 1.26), stratified by treatment and adjusted for number of positive nodes, menopausal status, hormone receptor status, and tumor size. The overall adjusted failure risk ratio (weight-based v reduced initial doses) was 0.73 (95% confidence interval, 0.53 to 1.00) among obese women.CONCLUSION: Obese patients initially dosed (within 5%) by actual weight did not experience excess cycle 1 toxicity or worse outcome compared with nonobese women dosed similarly. The data suggest that obese women who received reduced doses in cycle 1 experienced worse failure-free survival. We recommend that initial doses of CAF be computed according to actual body weight.",0
Molecular predictors of efficacy of adjuvant weekly paclitaxel in early breast cancer.,"Treatment with fluororacil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide followed by weekly paclitaxel (FEC-P) yielded superior disease-free survival than FEC in the adjuvant breast cancer trial GEICAM 9906. We evaluate molecular subtypes predictive of prognosis and paclitaxel response in this trial. Two molecular subtype classifications based on conventional immunohistochemical and fluorescent in situ hybridization determinations were used: #1: Four groups segregated according to the combination of hormone receptor (HR) and HER2 status; #2: Intrinsic subtype classification (Triple Negative (TN), HER2, Luminal B and Luminal A). Results: Both subtype classifications yielded prognostic and predictive information. HR +/HER2- patients (and Luminal A patients) had a significantly better outcome than the other subgroups of patients. The superiority of FEC-P over FEC was clearly more marked in HR-/HER2- patients (TN patients), particularly in the subset with basal phenotype (TN and either EGFR+ or cytokeratins 5/6+). The Luminal A subtype also achieved a significant benefit with FEC-P. The molecular-defined subgroup of TN was clearly predictive of better response to treatment with FEC-P. Luminal A patients had the best prognosis and also have a better outcome with weekly paclitaxel.",0
Tamoxifen with or without breast irradiation in women 50 years of age or older with early breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: We determined the effect of breast irradiation plus tamoxifen on disease-free survival and local relapse in women 50 years of age or older who had T1 or T2 node-negative breast cancer. METHODS: Between December 1992 and June 2000, 769 women with early breast cancer (tumor diameter, 5 cm or less) were randomly assigned to receive breast irradiation plus tamoxifen (386 women) or tamoxifen alone (383 women). The median follow-up was 5.6 years. RESULTS: The rate of local relapse at five years was 7.7 percent in the tamoxifen group and 0.6 percent in the group given tamoxifen plus irradiation (hazard ratio, 8.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 3.3 to 21.2; P<0.001), with corresponding five-year disease-free survival rates of 84 percent and 91 percent (P=0.004). A planned subgroup analysis of 611 women with T1, receptor-positive tumors indicated a benefit from radiotherapy (five-year rates of local relapse, 0.4 percent with tamoxifen plus radiotherapy and 5.9 percent with tamoxifen alone; P<0.001). Overall, there was a significant difference in the rate of axillary relapse at five years (2.5 percent in the tamoxifen group and 0.5 percent in the group given tamoxifen plus irradiation, P=0.049), but no significant difference in the rates of distant relapse or overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: As compared with tamoxifen alone, radiotherapy plus tamoxifen significantly reduces the risk of breast and axillary recurrence after lumpectomy in women with small, node-negative, hormone-receptor-positive breast cancers.",0
Single circulating tumor cell detection and overall survival in nonmetastatic breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Circulation of cancer cells in the blood is a mandatory step for metastasis, but circulating tumor cells (CTC) have a low metastatic efficiency in preclinical animal models. In this prospective study, we reported the clinical outcome of nonmetastatic breast cancer patients according to CTC detection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 115 nonmetastatic patients diagnosed with large operable or locally advanced breast cancer, we prospectively detected CTC using the CellSearch system before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in a phase II trial (REMAGUS02). RESULTS: At baseline, 23% of patients were CTC positive, but only 10% had >1 CTC/7.5 ml of blood. After a median follow-up of 36 months, CTC detection before chemotherapy was an independent prognostic factor for both distant metastasis-free survival [DMFS; P = 0.01, relative risk (RR) = 5.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4-17] and overall survival (OS; P = 0.007, RR = 9, 95% CI 1.8-45). CTC detection after chemotherapy was of less significance (P = 0.07 and 0.09, respectively). Moreover, CTC detection showed interesting characteristics as an individual predictive test for metastatic relapses (sensibility 55%, specificity 81%, and global accuracy 77%). CONCLUSIONS: Detection of > or =1 CTC/7.5 ml before neoadjuvant chemotherapy can accurately predict OS. Our findings may change the clinical management of nonmetastatic breast cancer and indicate that the metastatic efficiency of CTC could be higher than previously reported.",0
Adjuvant endocrine treatment (goserelin vs tamoxifen) in pre-menopausal patients with operable node positive stage II breast cancer. A prospective randomized national multicenter study.,"AIMS: To evaluate possible differences in effect on time to recurrence and overall survival in node positive pre-menopausal breast cancer patients (age < or = 50 years) receiving LHRH analogue or tamoxifen as adjuvant endocrine treatment. METHODS: Between January 1989 and July 1994, 320 patients with node positive (pN(+)) and hormone receptor positive or receptor status unknown tumors were included and randomized in a national multicenter study to receive either tamoxifen or goserelin as adjuvant treatment for two years. Primary surgical treatment was employed according to current standards. Final follow-up was completed as of December 2000. Time to events were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and compared by the log rank test. Relative risks were estimated by the Cox's proportional hazards model. RESULTS: No differences in time to first recurrence or overall survival were observed between treatment groups. Proportions of patients in each group having a second breast cancer were also similar. CONCLUSIONS: Standard adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen as compared to adjuvant LHRH analogue therapy employed in this group of breast cancer patients gave similar outcomes, but the number of patients was too small to formally exclude a potentially clinically relevant difference in survival.",1
Isolated central nervous system metastases in patients with HER2-overexpressing advanced breast cancer treated with first-line trastuzumab-based therapy.,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to characterize the prevalence and predictors of central nervous system (CNS) metastasis among women with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer receiving trastuzumab-based therapy. METHODS: The frequency and time course of isolated CNS progression were characterized among women with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, receiving chemotherapy with or without trastuzumab as first-line treatment for metastatic disease in two clinical trials. The first trial was a multicenter randomized phase III study of chemotherapy (doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide or paclitaxel) +/- trastuzumab, and the second was a multicenter phase II trial of vinorelbine + trastuzumab. All patients had measurable disease and were free of symptomatic CNS disease at initiation of study treatment. RESULTS: Nearly 10% of patients receiving trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy developed isolated CNS metastases as first site of tumor progression. Progression in the CNS tended to be a later event than progression at other sites among women receiving trastuzumab-based therapy. Trastuzumab-based treatment did not substantially delay onset of CNS metastases as initial site of progression. Following diagnosis with primary breast cancer, tumors with HER2 gene amplification tend to be associated with greater risk of isolated CNS progression compared with those lacking gene amplification. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer are at risk for isolated CNS progression, reflecting improved peripheral tumor control and patient survival through use of trastuzumab-based therapy, and a relative lack of CNS activity with trastuzumab. Clinicians should be aware of this association. Better treatments for CNS recurrences are needed.",0
Treatment of operable breast cancer in the elderly: a randomised clinical trial EORTC 10850 comparing modified radical mastectomy with tumorectomy plus tamoxifen.,"We have examined the outcome of older patients with operable breast cancer treated in a randomised trial by either standard surgery or less extensive surgery and tamoxifen. There were 236 participants aged >/=70 years, randomised to either modified radical mastectomy MRM (n=120) or wide local excision (WLE) and tamoxifen (T) 20 mg daily (n=116). Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate analyses were performed using Cox's proportional hazards model. Endpoints were survival and time to first relapse or progression, loco-regional progression, time to distant progression and progression-free survival. No significant difference was seen in terms of progression-free survival, but there were significantly more loco-regional relapses in the WLE+T group. In contrast, there were more distant metastases in the MRM group, but with a similar overall survival in both groups. The results of this trial give cautious support for the use of WLE+T for selected older women.",0
Prospective evaluation of carcinoembryonic antigen levels and alternating chemotherapeutic regimens in metastatic breast cancer.,"Ninety-seven eligible and evaluable women with metastatic breast cancer were placed on a prospective clinical protocol to evaluate the use of continuous cyclic therapy with dibromodulcitol, doxorubicin, vincristine, tamoxifen, and fluoxymesterone (DAVTH) v DAVTH alternating with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, and prednisone (CMFP); and the use of pretreatment and serial carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels in these patients. Continuous DAVTH and DAVTH/CMFP were equivalent therapies with respect to response rates, time to treatment failure (TTF), and survival. Pretreatment CEA levels were elevated (greater than 5 ng/mL) in 42/97 patients and less than 5 ng/mL in the remaining patients. Patients with elevated pretreatment CEA levels were more likely to be estrogen receptor (ER) positive (P = .006), to have prolonged disease-free intervals (P = .017), to have hepatic (P = .004) and/or osseous (P = .01) metastases, and to have multiple sites of metastatic disease (P = .004). Pretreatment CEA levels did not significantly predict for overall response rates, TTF, or survival; nonetheless, those patients with low pretreatment CEA levels had more complete responses (CRs) (16/55 v 4/42; P = .02). Serial CEA levels during therapy revealed a number of interesting patterns. During the first 4 months of treatment, serial CEA levels in responding patients either (1) progressively declined (15/29 women with elevated pretreatment CEA levels), or (2) initially rose significantly (mean, 243% of pretreatment value) and then declined (14/29 women with elevated pretreatment CEA levels). Peak CEA levels in the latter patients were seen 27 to 135 days following initiation of cytotoxic therapy. In some patients the initial increase in the CEA level was incorrectly interpreted as evidence of impending disease progression. CEA levels frequently increased around the time of clinical disease progression. However, rising CEA levels rarely provided a clinically meaningful lead time before the appearance of other clinical evidence of disease progression. These data suggest that routine pretreatment and monthly serial CEA levels in metastatic breast cancer patients have minimal use in clinical practice. Two further noteworthy findings were observed in this prospective study. First, patients with an unknown ER status had a prolonged median survival when compared with patients with ER positive or negative tumors; this appeared to be related to prolonged disease-free intervals in ER unknown patients. Second, two case of secondary acute leukemia were seen in patients treated with continuous DAVTH therapy.",1
Cardioprotection with dexrazoxane for doxorubicin-containing therapy in advanced breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: To determine the cardioprotective effect of dexrazoxane (DZR) used in a doxorubicin-based combination therapy in advanced breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between November 1988 and January 1991, 534 patients with advanced breast cancer were randomized to two multicenter, double-blind studies (088001 and 088006). Patients received fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) with either DZR (DZR-to-doxorubicin ratio, 10:1) or placebo (PLA) every 3 weeks and were monitored with serial multiplegated acquisition (MUGA) scans. RESULTS: The hazards ratio (HR) of PLA to DZR for a cardiac event, which was predefined ejection fraction changes or congestive heart failure (CHF), was 2.63 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.61 to 4.27; P < .001) for 088001 and 2.00 (95% CI, 1.01 to 3.96; P = .038) for 088006. The objective response rates for 088001 were 46.8% for DZR and 60.5% for PLA, a difference of 14% (95% CI, -25% to -2%; P = .019), and for 088006 were 53.7% for DZR and 49.3% for PLA, a difference of 4% (95% CI, -13% to 22%; P = .63). Time to progression and survival were not significantly different between treatment arms in either study. Toxicities on the DZR arms included lower granulocyte and platelet counts at nadir (P = .009 and P = .004, respectively) and more pain on injection (P = .001), with no difference in the rates of fever, infection, or hemorrhage. CONCLUSION: DZR had a significant cardioprotective effect as measured by noninvasive testing and clinical CHF. One of the two studies (088001) showed a lower response rate with DZR, but time to progression and survival were not significantly different. DZR is the first agent shown to reduce cardiotoxicity from doxorubicin.",0

"Postoperative chemoendocrine therapy for women with node-positive stage II breast cancer with combined cyclophosphamide, tamoxifen, and 1-hexylcarbamoyl-5-fluorouracil.","OBJECTIVE: To find out whether the addition of 1-hexylcarbamoyl-5-fluorouracil to a postoperative regimen of oral cyclophosphamide and tamoxifen improved the prognosis of carcinoma of the breast. DESIGN: Randomised controlled clinical trial. SETTING: 127 Institutions in Japan. SUBJECTS: 785 Patients with stage II carcinoma (palpable axillary nodes) who had total mastectomy and axillary clearance. INTERVENTIONS: The control group were given oral cyclophosphamide 50 mg/day and tamoxifen 20 mg/day for 2 years; the experimental group were given these drugs plus 1-hexylcarbamoyl-5-fluorouracil 300 mg/day for 2 years. RESULTS: There was no survival advantage (and more toxicity) in the experimental group, except in a subgroup with 1-3 axillary nodes involved. CONCLUSION: The advantage of triple chemotherapy in the subgroup must be substantiated by a new randomised trial confined to patients with 1-3 axillary nodes involved.",1
"Effect of anastrozole on bone mineral density: 5-year results from the anastrozole, tamoxifen, alone or in combination trial 18233230.","PURPOSE: The Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination (ATAC) trial (median follow-up, 68 months) has shown that adjuvant anastrozole has superior efficacy and better tolerability than tamoxifen. However, anastrozole reduces circulating estrogen, and low estradiol levels are associated with decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and increased fracture risk. It is therefore important to understand the effects of long-term aromatase inhibitor therapy on BMD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective substudy of the ATAC trial assessed BMD changes in postmenopausal women with invasive primary breast cancer receiving anastrozole (1 mg/d) or tamoxifen (20 mg/d) as adjuvant therapy for 5 years. Lumbar spine and total hip BMD were assessed at baseline and after 1, 2, and 5 years. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-seven women from the monotherapy arms of the ATAC trial were recruited onto the bone substudy, and 108 were included in the primary analysis. Among anastrozole-treated patients, there was a decrease in median BMD from baseline to 5 years in lumbar spine (-6.08%) and total hip (-7.24%) compared with the tamoxifen group (lumbar spine, +2.77%; total hip, +0.74%). No patients with normal BMD at baseline became osteoporotic at 5 years. CONCLUSION: Anastrozole is associated with accelerated bone loss over the 5-year treatment period. However, although patients with pre-existing osteopenia are likely to require monitoring and bone-protection strategies, patients with normal BMD would not appear to require monitoring beyond the recommendation for healthy postmenopausal women. The effect of anastrozole on bone should be weighed against its superior efficacy and better tolerability profile versus tamoxifen in the main ATAC trial.",0
Effect of long-term bisphosphonate treatment on morbidity due to bone metastases in breast cancer patients.,"The effect of long-term bisphosphonate (APD) treatment on the morbidity from bone metastases in breast cancer patients was studied in a controlled clinical trial. 131 patients were randomized between treatment with APD (300 mg/day orally) or control. Systemic treatment for breast cancer was left to the discretion of the physician. The distribution of cases according to age, receptor status and previous treatment was similar in both groups. Patients were examined at 3-month intervals, while bone scans and radiography of relevant lesions in the skeleton were performed every 6 months. After a median follow-up of 13 months, the morbidity in the treated group was significantly less than in the controls. This concerned the occurrence of hypercalcemia, bone pain and fractures, and the need for radiotherapy of osteolytic lesions. In this interim analysis, APD treatment more than halved the requirement for specific treatment of bone lesions. The treatment is simple and well tolerated at a relatively low dosage. A higher oral dose was precluded due to gastrointestinal toxicity. Because the effect of APD on skeletal morbidity was not complete, efforts should be made to develop more effective and less toxic bisphosphonates.",0
Letrozole in the neoadjuvant setting: the P024 trial.,"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy trials have consistently reported lower response rates in hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer when compared with HR- cases. Preoperative endocrine therapy has therefore become a logical alternative and has gained considerable momentum from the finding that aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are more effective than tamoxifen for HR+ breast cancer in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. The most convincing neoadjuvant trial to demonstrate the superiority of an AI versus tamoxifen was the P024 study, a large multinational double-blind trial in postmenopausal women with HR+ breast cancer ineligible for breast-conserving surgery. The overall response rate (ORR) was 55% for letrozole and 36% for tamoxifen (P<0.001). Significantly more letrozole-treated patients underwent breast-conserving surgery (45 vs. 35%, respectively; P=0.022). In addition, ORR was significantly higher with letrozole than tamoxifen in the human epidermal growth factor receptor HER1/HER2+ subgroup (P=0.0004). The clinical efficacy of letrozole in HER2+ breast cancer was confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis and was found to be comparable to that of HER2- cases (ORR 71% in both subsets). Biomarker studies confirmed the superiority of letrozole in centrally assessed estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) tumors and found a strong relationship with the degree of ER positivity for both agents. Interestingly, letrozole was effective even in marginally ER+ tumors and, unlike tamoxifen, consistently reduced the expression from estrogen-regulated genes (progesterone receptor and trefoil factor 1). Furthermore, when analyzed by Ki67 immunohistochemistry, letrozole was significantly more effective than tamoxifen in reducing tumor proliferation (P=0.0009). Thus, neoadjuvant letrozole is safe and superior to tamoxifen in the treatment of postmenopausal women with HR+ locally advanced breast cancer.",0
"HER2 status in hormone receptor positive premenopausal primary breast cancer adds prognostic, but not tamoxifen treatment predictive, information.","BACKGROUND: Overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) or amplification of its gene is a prognostic factor in primary breast cancer and a predictor for tamoxifen treatment efficacy in oestrogen receptor (ER) positive disease. In the present study we explored a defined cohort of breast cancer patients included in a randomised trial in order to assess prognostic and tamoxifen treatment information yielded by HER2 status.METHODS: Premenopausal breast cancer patients with stage II tumours (n = 564) were included and allocated to 2 years of adjuvant tamoxifen treatment versus no adjuvant treatment. ER, progesterone receptor (PR) status and HER2 status was determined by immunohistochemistry using a tissue microarray. HER2 amplification was analysed by fluorescent in situ hybridisation and tumours being amplified and/or HER2 3+ were considered HER2+. HER2 status was evaluable in 83% of the patients and 12.6% were HER2+. In untreated patients, HER2 was a negative prognostic factor in ER+ patients, HR 2.95; 95% CI: 1.61-5.38, p < 0.001, but not in ER- patients, HR 0.67; 95% CI: 0.28-1.61, p = 0.4, and a significant interaction between the two markers was found, p < 0.01. HER2 status was not related to tamoxifen treatment efficacy in ER+ patients (term of interaction p = 0.95). When stratifying for PR status, similar results were achieved.DISCUSSION: HER2+ and ER+ breast cancer constituted a subgroup of tumours with poor prognosis in premenopausal breast cancer, whereas no treatment interaction was found between HER2 status and tamoxifen in ER+ tumours. The poor prognosis in HER2+ and ER+ patients may interfere with the interpretation of HER2 data in non-randomised trials of adjuvant tamoxifen.",0
A toxic interaction between mitomycin C and tamoxifen causing the haemolytic uraemic syndrome.,"A comparison of patients receiving combination chemotherapy with mitomycin C, mitozantrone and methotrexate (3M) with and without tamoxifen for treatment of primary breast cancer indicates an increased risk of anaemia (P < 0.0001) and thrombocytopenia (P < 0.001), but not leucopenia for patients receiving tamoxifen with their chemotherapy compared to those receiving the chemotherapy alone. Furthermore, 9 out of 94 patients receiving tamoxifen with 3M developed progressive anaemia, thrombocytopenia and abnormal renal function as early features of microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, progressing on to various degrees of the haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS). This is only rarely seen with patients receiving mitomycin C alone at higher doses than used in the 3M combination and in the presence of active metastatic disease. This syndrome can be fatal and 1 of our 9 patients died. These observations indicate that there may be an interaction between tamoxifen and mitomycin C, causing an increased incidence of anaemia, thrombocytopenia and an increased risk of HUS. The combination of these two drugs should be avoided or carefully monitored.",0
Randomized trial of high-dose chemotherapy and blood cell autografts for high-risk primary breast carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: Uncontrolled studies have reported encouraging outcomes for patients with high-risk primary breast cancer treated with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell support. We conducted a prospective randomized trial to compare standard-dose chemotherapy with the same therapy followed by high-dose chemotherapy. PATIENTS and METHODS: Patients with 10 or more positive axillary lymph nodes after primary breast surgery or patients with four or more positive lymph nodes after four cycles of primary (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy were eligible. All patients were to receive eight cycles of 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin (Adriamycin), and cyclophosphamide (FAC). Patients were stratified by stage and randomly assigned to receive two cycles of high-dose cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and cisplatin with autologous hematopoietic stem cell support or no additional chemotherapy. Tamoxifen was planned for postmenopausal patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors and chest wall radiotherapy was planned for all. All P values are from two-sided tests. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients (48 after primary surgery and 30 after primary chemotherapy) were registered. Thirty-nine patients were randomly assigned to FAC and 39 to FAC followed by high-dose chemotherapy. After a median follow-up of 6.5 years, there have been 41 relapses. In intention-to-treat analyses, estimated 3-year relapse-free survival rates were 62% and 48% for FAC and FAC/high-dose chemotherapy, respectively (P =.35), and 3-year survival rates were 77% and 58%, respectively (P =.23). Overall, there was greater and more frequent morbidity associated with high-dose chemotherapy than with FAC; there was one septic death associated with high-dose chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: No relapse-free or overall survival advantage was associated with the use of high-dose chemotherapy, and morbidity was increased with its use. Thus, high-dose chemotherapy is not indicated outside a clinical trial.",1
"Treatment of metastatic breast cancer patients with different dosages of megestrol acetate; dose relations, metabolic and endocrine effects.","Megestrol acetate (MA) is of therapeutic value in breast cancer patients. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of different dosages of MA on endocrine events potentially influenced by the drug in relation to plasma level of MA and clinical effects in patients with advanced breast cancer. Eighteen postmenopausal patients were randomly distributed over six groups to receive daily 90, 180 or 270 mg of MA (niagestin) orally in a cross-over study consisting of 3 periods of 6 weeks. Complete remission was observed in 1 patient, partial remission in 9, no change in 4 and failure in 4 patients. During the 18 weeks of treatment plasma levels of MA gradually increased, irrespective of the dose administered. Significant rises of the basal and TRH-stimulated plasma PRL and basal insulin levels were observed, whereas LH and FSH, estradiol, SHBG and the pituitary-adrenal axis were suppressed. None of these metabolic effects showed a correlation with the clinical response. We concluded that treatment of metastatic breast cancer with 180 mg MA/day is effective and causes minimal adverse effects.",1
S-phase fraction and survival benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy of breast cancer.,"Cancer chemotherapy interacts with cell proliferation, but data on the relationship between cancer cell replication and the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy are scarce. We have investigated the S-phase fractions of the primary tumour from premenopausal breast cancer patients who participated in a randomised trial comparing 12 cycles of polychemotherapy (CMF) with post-operative radiotherapy. DNA flow cytometry was performed on frozen tissues from 208 primary breast carcinomas, of which the S-phase fraction was estimated in 176 cases. There was a significantly higher benefit from CMF among patients with a high S-phase fraction (P = 0.0033). The relative risk of distant recurrence or death in the chemotherapy group as compared with the radiotherapy group was 0.19 for patients whose tumours had an S-phase fraction of 10% or over (95% CI 0.07-0.51) and 1.55 (0.88-2.73) for patients whose tumours showed lower S-phase levels. The interaction was still significant in multivariate analysis (P = 0.0057), including lymph node metastases, tumour size and oestrogen receptor content. We conclude that the benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy compared with radiotherapy is largely confined to patients with highly proliferative tumours.",0
Effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy in combination with tamoxifen for node-positive postmenopausal breast cancer patients.,"PURPOSE: Adjuvant tamoxifen has been shown to reduce relapse and mortality among node-positive post-menopausal breast cancer patients. The value of adding chemotherapy to tamoxifen is controversial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between July 1986 and April 1993, 1,266 postmenopausal breast cancer patients with node-positive disease were randomly assigned to receive one of four adjuvant therapy regimens: (A) tamoxifen alone for 5 years; (B) tamoxifen plus three courses of early cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) on months 1, 2, and 3; (C) tamoxifen plus delayed single courses of CMF on months 9, 12, and 15; (D) tamoxifen plus early and delayed CMF on months 1, 2, 3, 9, 12, and 15. The two-by-two factorial design allowed two direct comparisons: early CMF (B and D) versus no early CMF (A and C), and delayed CMF (C and D) versus no delayed CMF (A and B). Estrogen receptor (ER) status was known for all patients and was used to stratify the randomization. A total of 1, 212 patients (96%) were eligible and assessable. The median follow-up duration was 60 months. RESULTS: The results of the two-by-two factorial comparisons were as follows: (1) early CMF added to tamoxifen significantly improved 5-year disease-free survival (DFS; 64% v 57%; hazards ratio [HR], 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66 to 0.95; P = .01); and (2) delayed CMF added to tamoxifen did not improve DFS (5-year DFS, 61% v 60%; HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.17; P = .77). For patients with ER-positive tumors, the addition of CMF, either early or delayed or both, reduced the relative risk of relapse by 22% to 36%. In contrast, for patients with ER-negative tumors, tamoxifen with delayed CMF was associated with a nonsignificant increased risk of relapse (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.76; P = .15). CONCLUSION: Postmenopausal patients with node-positive breast cancer should be offered combination chemotherapy in addition to tamoxifen. Tamoxifen should not be initiated before CMF, as this might be detrimental, especially for patients with ER-negative tumors.",1
"Treatment of axillary lymph node-negative, estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer: updated findings from National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project clinical trials.","BACKGROUND: Results from three National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project sequentially conducted randomized trials of postoperative chemotherapy in women with estrogen receptor-negative tumors and negative axillary lymph nodes have demonstrated that a combination of methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (MF) is more effective than surgery alone, that cyclophosphamide with MF (CMF) is more effective than MF, and that CMF and doxorubicin (Adriamycin) with cyclophosphamide (AC) are equally beneficial. This report presents updated findings from those trials, relates the results to age and menopausal status, and estimates the extent of progress made in treating such patients. METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned as follows: in B-13, 760 patients were assigned to surgery only or to MF; in B-19, 1095 patients were assigned to MF or CMF; in B-23, 2008 patients were assigned to CMF or AC. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated according to age and menopausal status. Smoothed recurrence rates were used to evaluate patterns of recurrence as a continuous function of age. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to test for interactions between treatment and covariates and to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for pairwise group comparisons. RESULTS: In B-13, through 16 years of follow-up, an overall benefit was seen with MF relative to surgery alone (RFS: HR = 0.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.44 to 0.78, P<0.001; OS: HR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.58 to 0.98, P = 0.03). In B-19, through 13 years of follow-up, an overall benefit was seen for CMF relative to MF (RFS: HR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.45 to 0.77, P<0.001; OS: HR = 0.71; 95% CI = 0.55 to 0.92; P = 0.01). In both trials, all age and menopausal groups demonstrated an RFS benefit, and most demonstrated an OS benefit. In B-23, through 8 years of follow-up, there were no statistically significant differences between the CMF and AC groups (RFS: HR = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.79 to 1.27, P = 0.97; OS, HR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.73 to 1.17; P = 0.51). When women in the CMF or AC groups (B-19, B-23) were compared with those who were in the surgery-alone group (B-13), through 8 years of follow-up there was a 58% reduction in recurrence and a 40% reduction in mortality as a result of the chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes in CMF- or AC-treated women with estrogen receptor-negative tumors and negative axillary lymph nodes were similar in all age groups. The decreased benefit from chemotherapy observed with increasing age was a result of a better outcome associated with advancing age in women who underwent surgery alone rather than a poorer outcome resulting from the use of chemotherapy.",0
Combined endocrine treatment of elderly postmenopausal patients with metastatic breast cancer. A randomized trial of tamoxifen vs. tamoxifen + aminoglutethimide and hydrocortisone and tamoxifen + fluoxymesterone in women above 65 years of age.,"The efficacy of combined endocrine therapy with tamoxifen (TAM), aminoglutethimide (AG), and hydrocortisone (H) or tamoxifen and fluoxymesterone (FLU) was evaluated against treatment with tamoxifen alone in 311 patients above 65 years of age with a first recurrence of a metastatic breast cancer. A total of 279 patients were eligible. The response rates were assessed for 258 fully evaluable patients and were the following for the TAM (N = 94), the TAM+AG+H (N = 83), and the TAM+FLU (N = 81) groups, respectively, PR: 14, 18, and 21%, and CR: 20, 11, and 23%. The overall response rates are not statistically different (p = 0.30). The 95% CL of difference in response rates for TAM vs. TAM+AG+H are -9-19% and for TAM vs. TAM+FLU -4-25%. Time to treatment failure was comparable with median values of 9.2, 7.7, and 9.2 months in the TAM, TAM+AG+H, and TAM + FLU group, respectively (p = 0.17). The corresponding figures for survival are median times of 22.0, 24.1, and 21.1 months with a p-value of 0.62. Toxicity was more pronounced in both the combined treatment groups, and could in most instances be attributed to treatment with either AG+H or FLU. Currently, new specific aromatase inhibitors with lesser toxicity than AG are being evaluated in combination with TAM for treatment of primary and metastatic breast cancer. In conclusion, the simultaneous use of TAM and AG +H or FLU does not seem to improve the therapeutic efficacy in elderly postmenopausal patients with metastatic disease. So far, combined endocrine therapy in this group of patients should only be used in the context of clinical trials.",1
Vindesine-epirubicin versus vindesine-mitoxantrone in metastatic breast cancer.,"The present study was designed to assess the toxicity and efficacy of two chemotherapy protocols in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Starting in December 1985, 230 patients were randomized to receive vindesine (V) (3 mg/m2 i.v.) and mitoxantrone (M) (10 mg/m2 i.v.) or V and epirubicin (E) (40 mg/m2 i.v.) every 3 weeks x 3 and every 4 weeks thereafter. Patients were stratified according to site of disease (visceral, bone or soft tissue dominant) and prior therapy. Patient groups were comparable with respect to menopausal status, age, estrogen receptor status and disease-free interval. About two-thirds of the patients presented with visceral recurrence and 30% with bone lesions: only 8% had soft tissue metastases. Results: We observed a significant difference (p = 0.003) in the frequency of alopecia (WHO grade 3-4, 36% vs. 60% favoring regimen VM); gastrointestinal and hematologic side effects and neurotoxicity were mild and similar for both groups. In 182 evaluable patients there was a 26% response rate (CR + PR. UICC criteria) for VM and 35% for VE (not significant). NC was observed in 37% and 43% of patients treated with VM or VE respectively. There was no significant difference between these two groups with regard to time to progression and survival. The median time of follow-up was 8 months and therefore too short to draw definite conclusions. Both regimens were well tolerated and seem to be equally effective, although the response rate for VM and VE was lower than expected.",1
Randomized phase II trial of carminomycin versus 4'-epidoxorubicin in advanced breast cancer.,"Sixty-three evaluable patients with advanced breast cancer were randomly allocated to receive three-week intravenous courses of carminomycin (18 mg/m2) or 4'-epidoxorubicin (90 mg/m2). The former yielded one (3%) partial response for nine weeks among 29 patients whereas, in the other arm, nine (27%) of 34 patients achieved partial response for a median of 28 weeks (range, nine to 36 weeks; p less than 0.02). The major toxic effect of these anthracyclines was leukopenia with median white blood cell nadirs of 1,600/microL (range, 300-4,000/microL) versus 1,800/microL (range, 500-4,300/microL), respectively. Acute nonhematologic toxic effects were qualitatively similar but carminomycin produced significantly less gastrointestinal intolerance and alopecia. Patients whose disease failed to respond to first-line anthracycline received doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) every three weeks. Four partial responses were obtained among 19 patients previously treated with carminomycin. Following 4'-epidoxorubicin therapy, one of 12 evaluable patients also attained partial response. Survival curves were not affected by the initial treatment option. Carminomycin has marginal activity against breast cancer whereas 4'-epidoxorubicin deserves further evaluation of its therapeutic index relative to doxorubicin. The design used in this trial appears attractive for prompt phase II evaluation of anthracycline analogs.",1
Quality of life in women with metastatic breast cancer during 9 months after randomization in the TEX trial (epirubicin and paclitaxel w/o capecitabine).,"The aim of this study was to compare the effects on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of two treatment regimens in the TEX trial during 9 month from random assignment, with emphasis on the 2- and 9-months assessments. A total of 287 patients were randomized to treatment in 3-week cycles with either epirubicin plus paclitaxel (ET, 143 patients), or epirubicin, paclitaxel and capecitabine (TEX, 144 patients). HRQOL was assessed by the EORTC-QLQ C30 and EORTC QLQ-BR23 questionnaires at five points during 9 months. A total of 252 (88%) completed questionnaires before randomization. Response rate for the following assessments was >75%. There were no statistically significant differences between the TEX group and the ET group on any of the subscales 2 months after randomization. Small clinical differences (5-10 points) in favor of the ET group were found for global quality of life, role functioning, social functioning, and insomnia. At the 9-months assessment, the TEX group scored statistically significantly higher on global quality of life and physical functioning. Small clinically significant differences were found for global quality of life, physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, dyspnoea, and insomnia, all in favour of the TEX group. At the 2-months assessment, when side-effects of chemotherapy were present, patients in the TEX group appeared to fare a bit worse than those receiving ET. However, after 9 months, when the patients had adapted to treatment, the TEX group seemed to have a slightly better quality of life.",0
Intensified neoadjuvant chemotherapy in early-responding breast cancer: phase III randomized GeparTrio study.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with an early response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy have chemosensitive tumors and a high probability for a pathological complete response at surgery. The relationship between extended chemotherapy and pathological complete response at surgery was investigated in a clinical trial. METHODS: Untreated breast cancer patients received two 3-week cycles of docetaxel at 75 mg/m(2), doxorubicin at 50 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide at 500 mg/m(2) (TAC). Those whose tumor size decreased by 50% or more by sonographic measurement (ie, reduction in the product of the two largest perpendicular diameters by at least 50%) were classified as responders and randomly assigned to receive four or six more cycles of TAC, for a total of six or eight TAC cycles. The primary aim was to increase the rate of a pathological complete response (defined as no invasive or in situ residual tumor masses in the breast and lymph nodes) from 20% to 26%. Sonographic response rates and rates of breast-conserving surgery and adverse effects were also assessed. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Of the 2090 patients in the GeparTrio trial, 1390 (66.5%) were randomly assigned as responders after two initial TAC cycles to receive an additional four (n = 704) or six (n = 686) TAC cycles. Rates of pathological complete response were not statistically significantly different between the arms (21.0% with six TAC cycles and 23.5% with eight TAC cycles; difference = 2.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -1.8% to 6.8%; P = .27). More clinical (48.2% vs 52.9%, difference = 4.7%; 95% CI = -0.55% to 9.95%; P = .08) and sonographic (22.6% vs 27.6%, difference = 5%; 95% CI = 0.45% to 9.55%; P = .033) complete responses at surgery were observed with eight TAC cycles than with six TAC cycles. The rate of breast-conserving surgery was similar in both arms (67.5% vs 68.5%, respectively, P = .68). Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia and edema and various grade 1 or 2 adverse events were more frequent in patients receiving eight TAC cycles than in those receiving six cycles. CONCLUSION: Patients receiving eight TAC cycles had statistically significantly higher sonographic response rates but not pathological complete response rates than those receiving six TAC cycles. However, they also had more toxic effects. So far, eight cycles of TAC cannot be recommended for the whole group of patients responding to two initial cycles of TAC.",1
Estrogen receptor-alpha phosphorylation at serine-118 and tamoxifen response in breast cancer.,"Although estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) [corrected] is a marker used to identify breast cancer patients most likely to benefit from endocrine therapy, approximately 50% of ER-positive [corrected] breast carcinomas are resistant to tamoxifen. Preclinical studies have shown that phosphorylation of ER [corrected] at serine-118 (ER alpha S118-P) is required for tamoxifen-mediated inhibition of ER-induced [corrected] gene expression. We evaluated the association between recurrence-free survival after tamoxifen treatment and ER alpha S118-P expression by use of Cox proportional hazards regression. Data were from 239 premenopausal patients with breast cancer who participated in a randomized trial of 2 years of adjuvant tamoxifen treatment vs no systemic treatment. ER alpha S118-P expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry and categorized by use of the Allred score (low expression = score of 0-6; high expression = score of 7-8). All statistical tests were two-sided. Compared with systemically untreated patients, we found evidence of a benefit from adjuvant tamoxifen among patients whose tumors had high ER alpha S118-P expression (23.7 recurrences per 1000 person-years versus 72.2 recurrences per 1000 person-years, hazard ratio [HR] of recurrence = 0.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.20 to 0.65) but not among patients whose tumors had low expression (51.0 recurrences per 1000 person-years versus 57.0 recurrences per 1000 person-years, HR of recurrence = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.51 to 1.48), a statistically significant difference (P for interaction = .037). ER alpha 118-P was not associated with recurrence-free survival among untreated patients. Thus, ER alpha S118-P expression appears to be associated with response to tamoxifen. [corrected]",0
"Sixteen-week multidrug regimen versus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil as adjuvant therapy for node-positive, receptor-negative breast cancer: an Intergroup study.","PURPOSE: The Intergroup conducted this breast cancer adjuvant trial to compare an investigational 16-week regimen with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (5-FU; CAF). The 16-week regimen features greater doxorubicin and 5-FU dose-intensity than CAF and improved scheduling of antimetabolites with sequential methotrexate and 5-FU, as well as infusion 5-FU. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 646 node-positive, receptor-negative patients were randomly assigned to receive either the 1 6-week regimen or six cycles of CAF. Breast cancer outcomes included recurrence as well as disease-free and overall survival. Toxicity was evaluated by the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC). Treatment-related quality of life was assessed by the Breast Chemotherapy Questionnaire (BCQ) before, during, and 4 months after treatment in 163 patients. The trial was designed to use one-sided tests of significance for power calculations, but is now reported with both one-sided and the traditional two-sided tests of significance. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 3.9 years, the estimated 4-year recurrence-free survival rate was 67.5% with the 16-week regimen versus 62.7% with CAF (P = .19, two-sided; P = .095, one-sided). The estimated 4-year survival rate was 78.1% with the 16-week regimen versus 71.4% with CAF (P = .10, two-sided; P = .05, one-sided). CAF produced significantly higher grades of leukopenia, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia, as well as liver and cardiac toxicity, whereas the 16-week regimen produced significantly higher grades of anemia, nausea, stomatitis, and weight loss, as well as skin and neurotoxicity. There were three treatment-related deaths with CAF but none with the 16-week regimen. During treatment, quality of life declined significantly more with the 16-week regimen than CAF, but by 4 months posttreatment, there was no difference. CONCLUSION: The 16-week regimen produced marginally better breast cancer outcomes than CAF with similar toxicity but a greater reduction in during-treatment quality of life. The 16-week regimen should not be used instead of a standard-dose regimen without careful consideration of the 16-week regimen's pros and cons, which include its complicated schedule. It should probably not be tested further, but its antimetabolite schedules and frequent drug administration (ie, dose density) should be considered in the development of new regimens.",1

"A multigene assay to predict recurrence of tamoxifen-treated, node-negative breast cancer.","BACKGROUND: The likelihood of distant recurrence in patients with breast cancer who have no involved lymph nodes and estrogen-receptor-positive tumors is poorly defined by clinical and histopathological measures. METHODS: We tested whether the results of a reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of 21 prospectively selected genes in paraffin-embedded tumor tissue would correlate with the likelihood of distant recurrence in patients with node-negative, tamoxifen-treated breast cancer who were enrolled in the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project clinical trial B-14. The levels of expression of 16 cancer-related genes and 5 reference genes were used in a prospectively defined algorithm to calculate a recurrence score and to determine a risk group (low, intermediate, or high) for each patient. RESULTS: Adequate RT-PCR profiles were obtained in 668 of 675 tumor blocks. The proportions of patients categorized as having a low, intermediate, or high risk by the RT-PCR assay were 51, 22, and 27 percent, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of the rates of distant recurrence at 10 years in the low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups were 6.8 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 4.0 to 9.6), 14.3 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 8.3 to 20.3), and 30.5 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 23.6 to 37.4). The rate in the low-risk group was significantly lower than that in the high-risk group (P<0.001). In a multivariate Cox model, the recurrence score provided significant predictive power that was independent of age and tumor size (P<0.001). The recurrence score was also predictive of overall survival (P<0.001) and could be used as a continuous function to predict distant recurrence in individual patients. CONCLUSIONS: The recurrence score has been validated as quantifying the likelihood of distant recurrence in tamoxifen-treated patients with node-negative, estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer.",0
"Effectiveness of a home care nursing program in the symptom management of patients with colorectal and breast cancer receiving oral chemotherapy: a randomized, controlled trial.","PURPOSE: To assess the effectiveness of a symptom-focused home care program in patients with cancer who were receiving oral chemotherapy in relation to toxicity levels, anxiety, depression, quality of life, and service utilization. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomized, controlled trial was carried out with 164 patients with a diagnosis of colorectal (n = 110) and breast (n = 54) cancers who were receiving oral capecitabine. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a home care program by a nurse or standard care for 18 weeks (ie, six cycles of chemotherapy). Toxicity assessments were carried out weekly for the duration of the patients' participation in the trial, and validated self-report tools assessed anxiety, depression, and quality of life. RESULTS: Significant improvements were observed in the home care group in relation to the symptoms of oral mucositis, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, pain, fatigue (first four cycles), and insomnia (all P < .05). This improvement was most significant during the initial two cycles. Unplanned service utilization, particularly the number of inpatient days (57 v 167 days; P = .02), also was lower in the home care group. CONCLUSION: A symptom-focused home care program was able to assist patients to manage their treatment adverse effects more effectively than standard care. It is imperative that patients receiving oral chemotherapy are supported with such programs, particularly during initial treatment cycles, to improve their treatment and symptom experiences.",0
Five versus more than five years of tamoxifen therapy for breast cancer patients with negative lymph nodes and estrogen receptor-positive tumors.,"BACKGROUND: In 1982, the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project initiated a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial (B-14) to determine the effectiveness of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy in patients with primary operable breast cancer who had estrogen receptor-positive tumors and no axillary lymph node involvement. The findings indicated that tamoxifen therapy provided substantial benefit to patients with early stage disease. However, questions arose about how long the observed benefit would persist, about the duration of therapy necessary to maintain maximum benefit, and about the nature and severity of adverse effects from prolonged treatment.PURPOSE: We evaluated the outcome of patients in the B-14 trial through 10 years of follow-up. In addition, the effects of 5 years versus more than 5 years of tamoxifen therapy were compared.METHODS: In the trial, patients were initially assigned to receive either tamoxifen at 20 mg/day (n = 1404) or placebo (n = 1414). Tamoxifen-treated patients who remained disease free after 5 years of therapy were then reassigned to receive either another 5 years of tamoxifen (n = 322) or 5 years of placebo (n = 321). After the study began, another group of patients who met the same protocol eligibility requirements as the randomly assigned patients were registered to receive tamoxifen (n = 1211). Registered patients who were disease free after 5 years of treatment were also randomly assigned to another 5 years of tamoxifen (n = 261) or to 5 years of placebo (n = 249). To compare 5 years with more than 5 years of tamoxifen therapy, data relating to all patients reassigned to an additional 5 years of the drug were combined. Patients who were not reassigned to either tamoxifen or placebo continued to be followed in the study. Survival, disease-free survival, and distant disease-free survival (relating to failure at distant sites) were estimated by use of the Kaplan-Meier method; differences between the treatment groups were assessed by use of the logrank test. The relative risks of failure (with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were determined by use of the Cox proportional hazards model. Reported P values are two-sided.RESULTS: Through 10 years of follow-up, a significant advantage in disease-free survival (69% versus 57%, P < .0001; relative risk = 0.66; 95% CI = 0.58-0.74), distant disease-free survival (76% versus 67%, P < .0001; relative risk = 0.70; 95% CI = 0.61-0.81), and survival (80% versus 76%, P = .02; relative risk = 0.84; 95% CI = 0.71-0.99) was found for patients in the group first assigned to receive tamoxifen. The survival benefit extended to those 49 years of age or younger and to those 50 years of age or older. Tamoxifen therapy was associated with a 37% reduction in the incidence of contralateral (opposite) breast cancer (P = .007). Through 4 years after the reassignment of tamoxifen-treated patients to either continued-therapy or placebo groups, advantages in disease-free survival (92% versus 86%, P = .003) and distant disease-free survival (96% versus 90%, P = .01) were found for those who discontinued tamoxifen treatment. Survival was 96% for those who discontinued tamoxifen compared with 94% for those who continued tamoxifen treatment (P = .08). A higher incidence of thromboembolic events was seen in tamoxifen-treated patients (through 5 years, 1.7% versus 0.4%). Except for endometrial cancer, the incidence of second cancers was not increased with tamoxifen therapy.CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The benefit from 5 years of tamoxifen therapy persists through 10 years of follow-up. No additional advantage is obtained from continuing tamoxifen therapy for more than 5 years.",1
DBCG trial 89B comparing adjuvant CMF and ovarian ablation: similar outcome for eligible but non-enrolled and randomized breast cancer patients.,"INTRODUCTION: A cohort of premenopausal patients with primary hormone receptor positive breast cancer was prospectively identified to be eligible for the DBCG 89B trial. We perform a long-term follow-up and evaluate the external validity of the trial. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Following registration in a population-based registry, patients were invited to be randomized to ovarian ablation (OA) versus nine courses of three-weekly cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF). The same procedures were used in all patients, including report forms, central review, querying, and analysis of data. Multivariate analysis was used to adjust for differences in base-line characteristics. RESULTS: Participation in the randomization varied according to center and time period. One thousand six hundred and twenty eight eligible patients were registered and 525 randomized in the DBCG 89B trial. Median estimated follow-up was 9.5 years for disease-free survival and 12.1 years for overall survival. Non-enrolled patients had a disease-free and overall survival similar to randomized patients. Within 5 years of surgery, results were similar following OA and CMF, but disease-free survival was significant inferior with OA more than five years after surgery, adjusted hazard ratio 1.38 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.85; p=0.03). This convened ten years after surgery to an inferior survival with OA, and the adjusted hazard ratio was 2.37 (95% CI 1.43 to 3.91; p<0.01). DISCUSSION: This prospective cohort study indicates that eligible patients not participating in the DBCG 89B trial had a similar disease-free and overall survival as participants. Survival was similar after OA and CMF in the first ten years, but became inferior in the OA group 10 or more years after surgery.",0
The effect of body mass index on overall and disease-free survival in node-positive breast cancer patients treated with docetaxel and doxorubicin-containing adjuvant chemotherapy: the experience of the BIG 02-98 trial.,"BACKGROUND: Obesity has been shown to be an indicator of poor prognosis for patients with primary breast cancer (BC) regardless of the use of adjuvant systemic therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of 2,887 node-positive BC patients enrolled in the BIG 02-98 adjuvant study, a randomised phase III trial whose primary objective was to evaluate disease-free survival (DFS) by adding docetaxel to doxorubicin-based chemotherapy. In the current analysis, the effect of body mass index (BMI) on DFS and overall survival (OS) was assessed. BMI was obtained before the first cycle of chemotherapy. Obesity was defined as a BMI >or= 30 kg/m2. RESULTS: In total, 547 (19%) patients were obese at baseline, while 2,340 (81%) patients were non-obese. Estimated 5-year OS was 87.5% for non-obese and 82.9% for obese patients (HR 1.34; P = 0.013). Estimated 5-years DFS was 75.9% for nonobese and 70.0% for obese patients (HR 1.20; P = 0.041). Ina multivariate model, obesity remained an independent prognostic factor for OS and DFS. CONCLUSIONS: In this study,obesity was associated with poorer outcome in node-positive BC patients. Given the increasing prevalence of obesity worldwide, more research on improving the treatment of obese BC patients is needed.",0
Predictors of early relapse in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer in the BIG 1-98 trial.,"BACKGROUND: Aromatase inhibitors are considered standard adjuvant endocrine treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, but it remains uncertain whether aromatase inhibitors should be given upfront or sequentially with tamoxifen. Awaiting results from ongoing randomized trials, we examined prognostic factors of an early relapse among patients in the BIG 1-98 trial to aid in treatment choices. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Analyses included all 7707 eligible patients treated on BIG 1-98. The median follow-up was 2 years, and the primary end point was breast cancer relapse. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify prognostic factors. RESULTS: Two hundred and eighty-five patients (3.7%) had an early relapse (3.1% on letrozole, 4.4% on tamoxifen). Predictive factors for early relapse were node positivity (P < 0.001), absence of both receptors being positive (P < 0.001), high tumor grade (P < 0.001), HER-2 overexpression/amplification (P < 0.001), large tumor size (P = 0.001), treatment with tamoxifen (P = 0.002), and vascular invasion (P = 0.02). There were no significant interactions between treatment and the covariates, though letrozole appeared to provide a greater than average reduction in the risk of early relapse in patients with many involved lymph nodes, large tumors, and vascular invasion present. CONCLUSION: Upfront letrozole resulted in significantly fewer early relapses than tamoxifen, even after adjusting for significant prognostic factors.",0
"HER-2 amplification and topoisomerase IIalpha gene aberrations as predictive markers in node-positive breast cancer patients randomly treated either with an anthracycline-based therapy or with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil.","PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate HER-2 and topoisomerase IIalpha (topo IIalpha) as candidates for predicting the activity of anthracyclines in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this study, we evaluated HER-2 and topo IIalpha gene aberrations by fluorescence in situ hybridization in a series of 430 primary breast cancer samples. Samples came from node-positive breast cancer patients randomly treated either with one of two anthracycline-based regimens [full-dose epirubicin-cyclophosphamide (HEC) and moderate-dose epirubicin-cyclophosphamide (EC)] or with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) in the context of a Phase III adjuvant therapy trial. Event-free survival comparisons were performed between the three study arms in the subgroups of HER-2-amplified and nonamplified tumors. An explorative analysis was also performed to evaluate the predictive value of topo IIalpha in the cohort of HER-2-amplified patients. RESULTS: HER-2 amplification was observed in 73 of the 354 evaluable samples (21%), whereas topo IIalpha amplification was found in 23 of the 61 evaluable HER-2-amplified tumors (38%). The three event-free survival comparisons were CMF versus HEC, CMF versus EC, and EC versus HEC. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were as follows: (a) CMF versus HEC, HR = 1.42 for HER-2-amplified tumors (95% CI, 0.54-3.76; P = 0.48) and 0.84 for HER-2-nonamplified tumors (95% CI, 0.49-1.44; P = 0.53); (b) CMF versus EC, HR = 1.65 for HER-2-amplified tumors (95% CI, 0.66-4.13; P = 0.29) and 0.66 for HER-2-nonamplified tumors (95% CI, 0.39-1.10; P = 0.11); and (c) EC versus HEC, HR = 0.93 for HER-2-amplified tumors (95% CI, 0.31-2.77, P = 0.90) and 1.33 for HER-2-nonamplified tumors (95% CI, 0.82-2.14; P = 0.25). Observed HRs suggest that the anthracycline-based therapy could be more effective than CMF in the subgroup of HER-2-amplified patients, whereas treatments could be equally active in the HER-2-nonamplified cohort. topo IIalpha evaluation suggests that the superiority of anthracyclines over CMF in HER-2-amplified patients could be confined to the subgroup of topo IIalpha-amplified tumors. CONCLUSIONS: HER-2 could have a predictive value for the activity of anthracycline-based regimens in the adjuvant therapy of breast cancer patients. The predictive value of HER-2 would most likely be related to the concomitant amplification of the topo IIalpha gene.",0
"Disease-free survival advantage of adjuvant cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil in patients with node-negative, rapidly proliferating breast cancer: a randomized multicenter study.","PURPOSE: According to one of the most recent key scientific questions concerning the use of biomarkers in clinical trials, we investigated whether node-negative breast cancer patients, defined as high-risk cases on the basis of tumor cell proliferation, could benefit from cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) adjuvant therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred eighty-one patients with negative nodes and rapidly proliferating tumors, defined according to thymidine labeling index (TLI), were randomized to receive six cycles of CMF or no further treatment after surgery +/- radiotherapy. RESULTS: The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 83% for patients treated with CMF compared with 72% in the control group (P: =.028). Adjuvant treatment reduced both locoregional and distant metastases. When clinical outcome was analyzed in cell kinetic subgroups characterized according to tertile criteria, compared with patients in the control arm, 5-year DFS was significantly higher after adjuvant CMF in patients with TLI values in the second (78% v 88%, respectively; P: =.037) and third tertiles (58% v 78%, respectively; P: =.024). CONCLUSION: The results from this randomized clinical study indicate that patients with node-negative, rapidly proliferating tumors significantly benefit from adjuvant CMF.",1
"Prospective, randomized trial of 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy in combination with the interleukin-3/granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) fusion protein (PIXY321) versus GM-CSF in patients with advanced breast cancer.","We conducted a prospective randomized trial to evaluate the ability of the interleukin-3/granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) fusion protein, PIXY321, to ameliorate cumulative thrombocytopenia after multiple cycles of 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide (FLAC) chemotherapy compared with GM-CSF in patients with advanced breast cancer. Fifty-three patients were randomized to receive either PIXY321. 375 microg/m2 twice a day subcutaneously, or GM-CSF, 250 microg/m2 daily subcutaneously after FLAC chemotherapy. PIXY321 was less well tolerated than GM-CSF, with more patients developing chills and local skin reactions and more patients stopping PIXY321 due to intolerance. While no difference in the neutrophil nadirs was seen with the two cytokines, the duration of the absolute neutrophil count less than 1,000/muL for all cycles was significantly longer with PIXY321 than with GM-CSF. Fifty percent of patients treated with multiple cycles of FLAC chemotherapy on both study arms developed dose-limiting thrombocytopenia. No differences in platelet nadirs, duration of thrombocytopenia, or need for platelet transfusions were observed with PIXY321 versus GM-CSF. The average delivered doses of FLAC chemotherapy were somewhat higher in the GM-CSF study arm. PIXY321 was not superior to GM-CSF in ameliorating the cumulative thrombocytopenia observed with multiple cycles of FLAC chemotherapy and was less well tolerated.",0
Oophorectomy and tamoxifen adjuvant therapy in premenopausal Vietnamese and Chinese women with operable breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: In 1992, the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group reported that a meta-analysis of six randomized trials in European and North American women begun from 1948 to 1972 demonstrated disease-free and overall survival benefit from adjuvant ovarian ablation. Approximately 350,000 new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed annually in premenopausal Asian women who have lower levels of estrogen than western women. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1993 to 1999, we recruited 709 premenopausal women with operable breast cancer (652 from Vietnam, 47 from China) to a randomized clinical trial of adjuvant oophorectomy and tamoxifen (20 mg orally every day) for 5 years or observation and this combined hormonal treatment on recurrence. At later dates estrogen- and progesterone-receptor protein assays by immunohistochemistry were performed for 470 of the cases (66%). RESULTS: Treatment arms were well balanced. With a median follow-up of 3.6 years, there have been 84 events and 69 deaths in the adjuvant treatment group and 127 events and 91 deaths in the observation group, with 5-year disease-free survival rates of 75% and 58% (P =.0003 unadjusted; P =.0075 adjusted), and overall survival rates of 78% and 70% (P =.041 unadjusted) for the adjuvant and observation groups, respectively. Only patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors benefited from the adjuvant treatment. In Vietnam, for women unselected for hormone receptor status, a cost-effectiveness analysis suggests that this intervention costs $350 per year of life saved. CONCLUSION: Vietnamese and Chinese women with hormone receptor-positive operable breast cancer benefit from adjuvant treatment with surgical oophorectomy and tamoxifen.",0
Paclitaxel versus doxorubicin as first-line single-agent chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer: a European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Randomized Study with cross-over.,"PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy of paclitaxel versus doxorubicin given as single agents in first-line therapy of advanced breast cancer (primary end point, progression-free survival ¿PFS) and to explore the degree of cross-resistance between the two agents. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred thirty-one patients were randomized to receive either paclitaxel 200 mg/m(2), 3-hour infusion every 3 weeks, or doxorubicin 75 mg/m(2), intravenous bolus every 3 weeks. Seven courses were planned unless progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred before the seven courses were finished. Patients who progressed within the seven courses underwent early cross-over to the alternative drug, while a delayed cross-over was optional for the remainder of patients at the time of disease progression. RESULTS: Objective response in first-line therapy was significantly better (P =.003) for doxorubicin (response rate ¿RR, 41%) than for paclitaxel (RR, 25%), with doxorubicin achieving a longer median PFS (7.5 months for doxorubicin v 3.9 months for paclitaxel, P <.001). In second-line therapy, cross-over to doxorubicin (91 patients) and to paclitaxel (77 patients) gave response rates of 30% and 16%, respectively. The median survival durations of 18.3 months for doxorubicin and 15.6 months for paclitaxel were not significantly different (P =.38). The doxorubicin arm had greater toxicity, but this was counterbalanced by better symptom control. CONCLUSION: At the dosages and schedules used in the present study, doxorubicin achieves better disease and symptom control than paclitaxel in first-line treatment. Doxorubicin and paclitaxel are not totally cross-resistant, which supports further investigation of these drugs in combination or in sequence, both in advanced disease and in the adjuvant setting.",1
The minimal effective exemestane dose for endocrine activity in advanced breast cancer.,"Phase I studies have demonstrated that exemestane, an irreversible oral aromatase inhibitor, is able to suppress circulating oestrogen levels. In our previous experience, doses ranging from 2.5 to 25 mg induced a similar suppression of oestrogens. The aim of this study was to identify the minimum effective exemestane dose on the basis of endocrine activity. 20 evaluable postmenopausal advanced breast cancer patients were randomly given exemestane 0.5, 1, 2.5 or 5 mg, in double-blind conditions. Oestrone (E1), oestradiol (E2), oestrone sulphate (E1S), gonadotrophins, sex-hormone binding globulin and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate serum levels were evaluated from the first day of treatment to the 7th, 14th, 28th and 56th day. Serum E1, E2 and E1S levels were suppressed by all doses starting from day 7; the degree of inhibition versus baseline was 25 up to 72% for E1, 30 up to 62% for E2 and 16 up to 52% for E1S, with higher doses achieving greater suppression; these changes were maintained over time. A significant increase in FSH and LH levels was observed for all doses. Treatment tolerability was satisfactory. The endocrine effects of exemestane appear to be dose related and 0.5 and 1 mg are ineffective for adequately suppressing circulating oestrogens.",1
Alteration of topoisomerase II-alpha gene in human breast cancer: association with responsiveness to anthracycline-based chemotherapy.,"PURPOSE: Approximately 35% of HER2-amplified breast cancers have coamplification of the topoisomerase II-alpha (TOP2A) gene encoding an enzyme that is a major target of anthracyclines. This study was designed to evaluate whether TOP2A gene alterations may predict incremental responsiveness to anthracyclines in some breast cancers.METHODS: A total of 4,943 breast cancers were analyzed for alterations in TOP2A and HER2. Primary tumor tissues from patients with metastatic breast cancer treated in a trial of chemotherapy plus/minus trastuzumab were studied for amplification/deletion of TOP2A and HER2 as a test set followed by evaluation of malignancies from two separate, large trials for changes in these same genes as a validation set. Association between these alterations and clinical outcomes was determined.RESULTS: Test set cases containing HER2 amplification treated with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) plus trastuzumab, demonstrated longer progression-free survival compared to those treated with AC alone (P = .0002). However, patients treated with AC alone whose tumors contain HER2/TOP2A coamplification experienced a similar improvement in survival (P = .004). Conversely, for patients treated with paclitaxel, HER2/TOP2A coamplification was not associated with improved outcomes. These observations were confirmed in a larger validation set, where HER2/TOP2A coamplification was again associated with longer survival when only anthracycline-containing chemotherapy was used for treatment compared with outcome in HER2-positive cancers lacking TOP2A coamplification.CONCLUSION: In a study involving nearly 5,000 breast malignancies, both test set and validation set demonstrate that TOP2A coamplification, not HER2 amplification, is the clinically useful predictive marker of an incremental response to anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Absence of HER2/TOP2A coamplification may indicate a more restricted efficacy advantage for breast cancers than previously thought.",0
Cardiac and vascular morbidity in women receiving adjuvant tamoxifen for breast cancer in a randomised trial. The Scottish Cancer Trials Breast Group.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine any cardiac or vascular morbidity associated with long term treatment with tamoxifen given after mastectomy for primary breast cancer. DESIGN: Cohort study using linkage between database of a randomised trial and statistics of Scottish hospital inpatients to identify episodes of cardiac and vascular morbidity. SETTING: NHS hospitals in Scotland. SUBJECTS: 1312 women who had undergone mastectomy for breast cancer and who were randomised either to a treatment group to receive adjuvant tamoxifen or to a control group to be given tamoxifen only on first relapse of disease. Maximum duration of tamoxifen treatment was 14 years. Total woman years of follow up were 9943. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Randomised and observational comparisons of risk (expressed as hazard ratios) of myocardial infarction, other cardiac event, cerebrovascular disease, or thromboembolic event according to treatment allocated and between nonusers, former users, and current users of tamoxifen. RESULTS: Use of tamoxifen was associated with lower rates of myocardial infarction. Hazard ratio for women in control group was 1.92 (95% confidence interval 0.99 to 3.73) compared with women allocated to adjuvant treatment. The association was stronger for current use: hazard ratio for non-users was 3.49 (1.52 to 8.03) compared with current users. Current users of tamoxifen, however, had higher rates of thromboembolic events:hazard ratio for non-users was 0.40 (0.18 to 0.90) compared with current users. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide further evidence that tamoxifen reduces the risk of myocardial infarction. Thromboembolic events should be carefully monitored in trials of tamoxifen, particularly those of prophylactic treatment, in which tamoxifen is given to healthy women.",0
Chemotherapy with or without estrogenic recruitment in metastatic breast cancer. A randomized trial of the Gruppo Oncologico Nord Ovest (GONO).,"BACKGROUND: This phase III study was carried out to verify whether a kinetic recruitment induced with low doses of diethylstilbestrol (DES) could increase the antitumor activity of chemotherapy in patients with advanced breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred fifty-eight women with metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide 600 mg/sqm i.v., epidoxorubicin 60 mg/sqm i.v. and fluorouracil 600 mg/ sqm i.v. (CEF) on day 1 or DES-CEF (diethylstilbestrol 1 mg orally days 1-3 CEF on day 4) every 21 days. Patients were treated until progression or, if responsive, for a maximum of 10 courses. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the two treatment arms in response rates (51.3% to CEF and 49.6% for DES-CEF); median progression-free survival (9.4 months for CEF and 11 months for DES-CEF group) or median overall survival (17.3 and 20 months for CEF and DES-CEF arms, respectively). Non-hematological toxicities were superimposable in the two arms, while DES-chemotherapy was more myelotoxic. CONCLUSIONS: This trial confirms that chemotherapy preceded by estrogenic recruitment is still in an experimental phase and that, at present, it has no role in clinical practice. Further research is needed to test the possibility of combining different mitogens in the light of new information about breast cancer cell growth.",1
Dose-response relationship of epirubicin in the treatment of postmenopausal patients with metastatic breast cancer: a randomized study of epirubicin at four different dose levels performed by the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group.,"PURPOSE: To test for possible correlations between dose of single-drug epirubicin and efficacy/toxicity in postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer. The study also included analysis of a correlation between pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred eighty-seven women were randomized to receive either 40, 60, 90, or 135 mg/m2 of epirubicin intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks. Treatment consisted of first-line cytotoxic therapy for metastatic disease. In patients with early progressive disease after either 40 or 60 mg/m2, dose escalation to 135 mg/m2 was performed. A full pharmacokinetic analysis was performed in 78 patients. RESULTS: Among 263 eligible patients, an increase in response rate and time to progression was found with an increase in dose from 40 to 90 mg/m2, while no increase in efficacy was found from 90 to 135 mg/m2. Multivariate analysis, using the Cox proportional hazards model with time to progression as the end point, confirmed that epirubicin dose more than 60 mg/m2 was an independent prognostic covariate. Furthermore, a significant association was established between randomized dose and both hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity. No association between pharmacokinetic parameters and efficacy parameters was demonstrated. On the other hand, a significant correlation between pharmacokinetic parameters and both hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity was found. CONCLUSION: An increase in dose of epirubicin from 40 to 90 mg/m2 is accompanied by increased efficacy. Further increases in dose do not yield increased efficacy. A positive correlation between epirubicin dose and toxicity, as well as a correlation between pharmacokinetic parameters and toxicity, was also established.",1
Preincisional paravertebral block reduces the prevalence of chronic pain after breast surgery.,"We reported earlier that preincisional paravertebral block (PVB) provides significant immediate postoperative analgesia after breast cancer surgery. In the same patients (n = 60), a 1-yr follow-up was performed to find out whether PVB could also reduce the prevalence of postoperative chronic pain. The follow-up consisted of a 14-day symptom diary and telephone interviews 1, 6, and 12 mo after surgery. The 14-day consumption of analgesics was similar in the 30 PVB and the 30 control patients. However, 1 mo after surgery, the intensity of motion-related pain was lower (P = 0.005) in the PVB group. Six months after surgery, the prevalence of any pain symptoms (P = 0.029) was lower in the PVB group. Finally, at 12 mo after surgery, in addition to the prevalence of pain symptoms (P = 0.003) and the intensity of motion-related pain (P = 0.003), the intensity of pain at rest (P = 0.011) was lower in the PVB group. These findings were independent of whether or not axillary dissection had been performed. The incidence of neuropathic pain was low (two and three patients in the PVB and control groups, respectively). In addition to providing acute postoperative pain relief, preoperative PVB seems to reduce the prevalence of chronic pain 1 yr after breast cancer surgery.",0
"Letrozole is more effective neoadjuvant endocrine therapy than tamoxifen for ErbB-1- and/or ErbB-2-positive, estrogen receptor-positive primary breast cancer: evidence from a phase III randomized trial.","PURPOSE: Expression of ErbB-1 and ErbB-2 (epidermal growth factor receptor and HER2/neu) in breast cancer may cause tamoxifen resistance, but not all studies concur. Additionally, the relationship between ErbB-1 and ErbB-2 expression and response to selective aromatase inhibitors is unknown. A neoadjuvant study for primary breast cancer that randomized treatment between letrozole and tamoxifen provided a context within which these issues could be addressed prospectively. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Postmenopausal patients with estrogen- and/or progesterone receptor-positive (ER+ and/or PgR+) primary breast cancer ineligible for breast-conserving surgery were randomly assigned to 4 months of neoadjuvant letrozole 2.5 mg daily or tamoxifen 20 mg daily in a double-blinded study. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for ER and PgR was conducted on pretreatment biopsies and assessed by the Allred score. ErbB-1 and ErbB-2 IHC were assessed by intensity and completeness of membranous staining according to published criteria. RESULTS: For study biopsy-confirmed ER+ and/or PgR+ cases that received letrozole, 60% responded and 48% underwent successful breast-conserving surgery. The response to tamoxifen was inferior (41%, P =.004), and fewer patients underwent breast conservation (36%, P =.036). Differences in response rates between letrozole and tamoxifen were most marked for tumors that were positive for ErbB-1 and/or ErbB-2 and ER (88% v 21%, P =.0004). CONCLUSION: ER+, ErbB-1+, and/or ErbB-2+ primary breast cancer responded well to letrozole, but responses to tamoxifen were infrequent. This suggests that ErbB-1 and ErbB-2 signaling through ER is ligand-dependent and that the growth-promoting effects of these receptor tyrosine kinases on ER+ breast cancer can be inhibited by potent estrogen deprivation therapy.",1

Long-term results of combined-modality therapy for locally advanced breast cancer with ipsilateral supraclavicular metastases: The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center experience.,"PURPOSE: To determine outcomes in local-regional control, disease-free survival, and overall survival in patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) who present with ipsilateral supraclavicular metastases and who are treated with combined-modality therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy patients with regional stage IV LABC, which is defined by our institution as LABC with ipsilateral supraclavicular adenopathy without evidence of distant disease, received treatment on three prospective trials of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. All patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil, or cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone. Patients then received local therapy that consisted of either total mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) or segmental mastectomy and ALND before or after irradiation. Patients with no response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy were treated with surgery and/or radiotherapy. After completion of local therapy, chemotherapy was continued for four to 15 cycles, followed by radiotherapy. Patients older than 50 years who had estrogen receptor-positive tumors received tamoxifen for 5 years. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 11.6 years (range, 4.8 to 22.6 years). Disease-free survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 34% and 32%, respectively. The median disease-free survival was 1.9 years. Overall survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 41% and 31%, respectively. The median overall survival was 3.5 years. The overall response rate (partial and complete responses) to induction chemotherapy was 89%. No treatment-related deaths occurred. CONCLUSION: Patients with ipsilateral supraclavicular metastases but no other evidence of distant metastases warrant therapy administered with curative intent, ie, combined-modality therapy consisting of chemotherapy, surgery, and radiotherapy. Patients with ipsilateral supraclavicular metastases should be included in the stage IIIB category of the tumor-node-metastasis classification because their clinical course and prognosis are similar to those of patients with stage IIIB LABC.",1
In vivo manipulation of human breast cancer growth by estrogens and growth hormone: kinetic and clinical results.,"Since 1983, a series of experimental and clinical studies have been carried out on the possibility of enhancing the chemotherapy effectiveness in breast cancer by expanding the fraction of cycling cells. Theoretically estrogens should recruit breast cancer cells and this fact should result in a higher killing efficiency of antiproliferative drugs. Actually it has been clearly shown, by means of the thymidine labeling index and primer-dependent alpha-DNA polymerase assay, that low doses of diethylstilbesterol are able to increase the tumor proliferative activity of human breast cancer in vivo (estrogenic recruitment). Three randomized trials have been carried out (one in locally advanced and two in metastatic breast cancer) comparing conventional polychemotherapy vs chemotherapy with estrogenic recruitment. Only limited advantages have been observed in these trials. Searching for new modalities of kinetic manipulation of tumors, recombinant human growth hormone has been employed in a pilot study: the preliminary results indicate that it largely enhances tumor proliferative activity, suggesting the possibility of employing a growth factor system to increase chemosensitivity.",0
"Efficacy of oral ondansetron, a selective antagonist of 5-HT3 receptors, in the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapies. Ondansetron Study Group.","We evaluated the efficacy and safety of oral ondansetron, a selective antagonist of 5-HT3 receptors, for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy (> 500 mg/m2). In this trial 324 chemotherapy-naive cancer patients, mostly females with breast cancer, were randomized to receive either placebo or ondansetron 1 mg, 4 mg, or 8 mg three times per day for 3 days. There were no differences in the doses of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and methotrexate between the study groups. All ondansetron dose groups were superior to the placebo control group (p < .001) for all measured efficacy parameters (complete response, number of emetic episodes, therapeutic failures, need of rescue antiemetics). No emetic episodes were reported by 9 (12%), 29 (37%), 48 (64%), and 47 (66%) of the placebo patients and the 1-mg, 4-mg, and 8-mg dose of ondansetron patients, respectively. Nausea was reduced and food intake was improved for all the ondansetron groups. A more severe emetic response was observed in patients receiving cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin combination chemotherapy. In this subgroup of patients, 66%, 38%, 25%, and 16% of the placebo group and 1-mg, 4-mg, and 8-mg ondansetron patients, respectively, required rescue antiemetics. No significant toxic effects were observed in this study. A higher incidence of headaches and gastrointestinal complaints (constipation, abdominal pain) were observed in the three ondansetron groups. In conclusion, oral ondansetron is an effective and well-tolerated antiemetic treatment in the management of cancer patients receiving ambulatory cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy. These results support the view that serotonin and 5-HT3 receptors play an important role in cyclophosphamide-induced nausea and vomiting.",0
Reduced incidence of invasive breast cancer with raloxifene among women at increased coronary risk.,"BACKGROUND: In the Raloxifene Use for The Heart trial, 10 101 postmenopausal women with coronary heart disease (CHD) or multiple CHD risk factors were randomly assigned to 60 mg/d raloxifene or to placebo and followed for a median of 5.6 years. Raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, was found to reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer and vertebral fractures but not the risk of cardiovascular events. Here, we provide further details about breast cancer incidence by tumor characteristics, duration of treatment, and subgroup. METHODS: Reported breast cancer was adjudicated by an independent committee based on medical records and pathology reports. The primary analyses used Cox proportional hazards models with time to first breast cancer as the outcome. Subgroup effects were analyzed using similar models with terms for treatment by subgroup. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: As previously reported, raloxifene reduced the incidence of invasive breast cancer by 44% (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.38 to 0.83; absolute risk reduction = 1.2 invasive breast cancers per 1000 women treated for 1 year). The lower incidence of invasive breast cancer reflected a 55% lower incidence of invasive estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumors (HR = 0.45; 95% CI = 0.28 to 0.72). However, raloxifene treatment did not reduce the incidence of noninvasive breast cancer or of invasive ER-negative breast cancer. The reduced incidence of invasive breast cancer was similar across subgroups, including those defined by age, body mass index, family history of breast cancer, prior use of postmenopausal hormones, and 5-year estimated risk of invasive breast cancer. CONCLUSION: Raloxifene reduces risk of invasive ER-positive breast cancer regardless of a woman's baseline breast cancer risk but does not reduce risk of noninvasive or ER-negative breast cancers. These results confirm those of the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation, a previous randomized trial among women with osteoporosis.",0
"Doxorubicin in combination with fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide (i.v. FAC regimen, day 1, 21) versus methotrexate in combination with fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide (i.v. CMF regimen, day 1, 21) as adjuvant chemotherapy for operable breast cancer: a study by the GEICAM group.","BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine the relative efficacy of doxorubicin versus methotrexate in combination with intravenous cyclophosphamide and 5-fluorouracil (FAC versus CMF) as adjuvant chemotherapy for operable breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Over a 4-year period, 985 women undergoing curative surgery for breast cancer (T1-3 N0-2 M0, stage I-IIIA, UICC) from nine hospitals were stratified with respect to axillary node involvement (node positive versus node negative) and randomized to receive either FAC (500/50/500/m(2)) every 3 weeks for six cycles or CMF (600/60/600/m(2)) every 3 weeks for six cycles. RESULTS: The relative dose intensities of FAC and CMF were 87% and 85% of planned doses, respectively. Unadjusted data indicated a non-significant trend towards better results with FAC. In the prospectively formed subset of node-negative patients, disease-free survival and overall survival were statistically superior in the FAC treatment arm (P = 0.041 and 0.034, respectively), but this advantage was not seen in the subset of node-positive patients, probably because of a difference in the percentage of patients with four or more positive nodes. Adjusting data for size of treatment effect and potential interactions (number of positive nodes, tumor size, treatment center), the overall relative risk (RR) of disease recurrence and death were significantly lower with FAC treatment (RR 1.2, P = 0.03, and RR 1.3, P = 0.05, respectively). This result was mainly due to the difference observed in the node-negative patient population. Toxicity was mild: FAC induced more alopecia, emesis, mucositis and cardiotoxicity; this last was of clinical concern, but was infrequent and manageable. CMF induced more conjunctivitis and weight gain. There were no toxic deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Doxorubicin in combination with day 1 i.v. cyclophosphamide and 5-fluorouracil is superior to methotrexate in combination with day 1 i.v. cyclophosphamide and 5-fluorouracil as adjuvant chemotherapy for operable breast cancer. A treatment effect is particularly evident in the node-negative patients. Although the clinical toxicity of FAC is greater than that of CMF, the levels were manageable and clinically acceptable.",1
Harvest quality and factors affecting collection and engraftment of CD34+ cells in patients with breast cancer scheduled for high-dose chemotherapy and peripheral blood progenitor cell support.,"The use of CFU-GM and CD34+ cell enumeration for assessing harvest quality and factors affecting peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) harvest and engraftment were investigated in 45 women with high-risk and metastatic breast cancer scheduled for dose-intensive cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, and carboplatin (CTCb). PBPC were mobilized with standard breast cancer regimens or cyclophosphamide (1.5 g/m2) and 5 micrograms/kg/day G-CSF and used together with G-CSF for hematopoietic support post-CTCb. There was a significant correlation between peripheral blood CD34+ cells/microliter and harvest CD34+/kg (r = 0.73, p < 0.0001) and between harvest CFU-GM and CD34+ cells/kg (r = 0.5, p < 0.0001). CFU-GM clonogenic assays were of no clinical use beyond that of CD34+ cell enumeration, with the latter allowing for real-time decisions regarding harvesting. Multiple stepwise regression identified the number of prior chemotherapy cycles as the only significant clinical predictor of CD34+ cell yield. For 34 patients proceeding to CTCb with PBPC support, multiple stepwise regression identified as the best predictors for engraftment CFU-GM and CD34+ cells/kg for neutrophils and CFU-GM, CD34+ cells/kg, and the number of prior cycles of chemotherapy for platelets, respectively. A threshold dose of 1 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg, obtained in 87% of these heavily pretreated breast cancer patients, was adequate to ensure engraftment within 15 days. There was no significant difference in length of hospital stay or blood product use between patients receiving 1-2.5 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg and greater than 2.5 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg, although median time to engraftment of neutrophils (9 days versus 8 days, p = 0.007) and platelets (12 days versus 9 days, p = 0.006) was significantly longer. The established threshold of > or = 1 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg will allow for more confident consideration of using aliquots of this threshold dose for hematopoietic support in sequential high-dose regimens inclusive of CTCb.",0
"Phase III, randomized, double-blind study of epoetin alfa compared with placebo in anemic patients receiving chemotherapy.","PURPOSE: To determine whether weekly epoetin alfa could improve hemoglobin (HgB) levels, reduce RBC transfusions, and improve quality of life (QOL) in patients with advanced cancer and with anemia after receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This double-blind, placebo-controlled study randomly assigned patients to placebo or epoetin alfa (Ortho Biotech, Bridgewater, NJ) 40,000 U subcutaneous weekly for 16 weeks. QOL, HgB, and RBC transfusions were measured pretreatment and monthly. RESULTS: The study accrued 344 patients; 330 were assessable for efficacy and 305 were assessable for QOL. Placebo-treated patients had a mean increase in HgB of 0.9 g/dL (range, -3.8 to +5.3) compared with 2.8 g/dL (range, -2.2 to +7.5) for epoetin-treated patients (P < .0001). During the study, 31.7% of placebo-treated patients achieved a > or = 2 g/dL HgB increase compared with 72.7% of epoetin-treated patients (P < .0001). The incidence of RBC transfusion for placebo and epoetin treatment arms was 39.6% and 25.3% (P = .005), respectively. The placebo group received 256 units of RBCs compared with 127 units in the epoetin group (P < .0001). The incidence of toxicity in the groups was similar. Changes in the average QOL scores from baseline to the end of the study were similar in the two groups (P = not significant). The HgB responders (irrespective of treatment arm) had a mean change in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) fatigue score from a baseline of +5.1 compared with -2.1 for the nonresponders (P = .006). CONCLUSION: Epoetin alfa significantly improved HgB and reduced transfusions in this patient population. These results support the use of weekly epoetin alfa as an ameliorative agent for cancer-related anemia.",0
"Prospective, randomized comparison of high-dose chemotherapy with stem-cell support versus intermediate-dose chemotherapy after surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy in women with high-risk primary breast cancer: a report of CALGB 9082, SWOG 9114, and NCIC MA-13.","PURPOSE: The prognosis for women with primary breast cancer involving multiple axillary nodes remains poor. High-dose chemotherapy with stem-cell support produced promising results in initial clinical trials conducted at single institutions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seven hundred eighty-five women aged 22 to 66 years with stage IIA, IIB, or IIIA breast cancer involving 10 or more axillary lymph nodes were randomized after surgery and standard adjuvant chemotherapy to either high-dose cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and carmustine (HD-CPB) with stem-cell support or intermediate-dose cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and carmustine (ID-CPB) with G-CSF support but without stem cells. Planned treatment for all patients included locoregional radiation therapy. Hormone-receptor-positive patients were to receive 5 years of tamoxifen. Event-free survival (EFS) was the primary end point. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 7.3 years. Event-free survival was not significantly different between the two treatment groups (P = .24). The probability of being free of an event at 5 years with HD-CPB was 61% (95% CI, 56% to 65%), and was 58% (95% CI, 53% to 63%) for ID-CPB. Thirty-three patients died of causes attributed to HD-CPB, compared with no therapy-related deaths among women treated with ID-CPB. Overall survival for the two arms was identical at 71% at 5 years (P = .75). CONCLUSION: HD-CPB with stem-cell support was not superior to ID-CPB for event-free or overall survival among all randomized women with high-risk primary breast cancer.",1
Effects of chemoendocrine therapy on the coagulation-fibrinolytic systems in patients with advanced breast cancer. Japan Advanced Breast Cancer Study Group and Japan Clinical Oncology Group.,"In order to predict a hypercoagulable state in patients with advanced breast cancer receiving medical treatment, the effects of chemoendocrine therapy on the coagulation-fibrinolytic systems were investigated prospectively. The patients were randomly divided into two groups. The ACT group had 38 patients, who received 20 mg/m2 adriamycin (ADM) i.v. on days 1 and 8, 100 mg cyclophosphamide (CPA) p.o. on days 1-14, and 20 mg tamoxifen (TAM) p.o. daily. The ACM group had 44 patients, who received 20 mg/m2 ADM i.v. on days 1 and 8, 100 mg CPA p.o. on days 1-14 and 1200 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) p.o. daily. The treatment was repeated every 28 days until there was evidence of progressive disease or until the full ADM dose (550 mg/m2) had been given. The following 9 hematologic parameters were measured every 4 weeks: alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor plasmin complex (PIC), anti-thrombin-III (AT-III), D-dimer (Dd), fibrinogen (Fg), plasminogen (Pg), protein C (PC), thrombin-antithrombin-III complex (TAT-III), tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), and factor X (FX). Compared to the ACT group, patients in the ACM group showed significantly higher values of AT-III and PC, which exceeded the normal ranges. The levels of Pg, t-PA and FX were significantly higher in the ACM group than in the ACT group, but were still within the normal ranges. The levels of TAT-III, Dd and PIC decreased in the ACT group and were unchanged in the ACM group after the start of treatment. Fg remained unchanged in both groups after the start of treatment. One patient in the ACM group had thrombophlebitis of the lower extremities with high levels of TAT-III, Dd and PIC and a decrease of Fg, but her condition returned to normal after reduction of the MPA dose. Although these data are not directly indicative of a hypercoagulable state in patients receiving chemoendocrine therapy, changes in AT-III, TAT-III, Dd and PIC should be monitored carefully when this type of treatment is given.",0
"Adjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil, vincristine, and prednisone compared with single-agent L-phenylalanine mustard for patients with operable breast carcinoma and positive axillary lymph nodes: 20-year results of a Southwest Oncology Group study.","BACKGROUND: Adjuvant combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil plus vincristine and prednisone (CMFVP) was compared with single-agent L-phenylalanine mustard (L-PAM) for the treatment of patients with axillary lymph node positive primary breast carcinoma over 20-years of follow-up. METHODS: Four hundred forty-one women with axillary lymph node positive breast carcinoma were randomized to receive either combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide (60 mg/m(2) orally every day for 1 year), fluorouracil (300 mg/m(2) intravenously [IV] weekly for 1 year), methotrexate (15 mg/m(2) IV weekly for 1 year), vincristine (0.625 mg/m(2) IV for 10 weeks), prednisone (30 mg/m(2) orally on Days 1-14, 20 mg/m(2) on Days 15-28, and 10 mg/m(2) on Days 29-42), or single-agent chemotherapy with L-PAM (5 mg/m(2) orally every day for 5 days every 6 weeks for 2 years) after undergoing surgery. Patients were stratified according to menopausal status and number of positive lymph nodes (1-3 positive lymph nodes or > 3 positive lymph nodes). Seventy-seven patients were ineligible. RESULTS: The maximum follow-up is 24 years, with a median follow-up of 21.5 years. Disease free survival and overall survival were superior with CMFVP (two-sided log-rank test; P = 0.0008 and P = 0.007, respectively). For all patients, the estimated 20-year survival rate of patients who received CMFVP was 40% compared with 27% for patients who received L-PAM. There was a substantial survival benefit for CMFVP compared with L-PAM in the subsets of premenopausal patients and patients with four or more positive lymph nodes. The estimated 20-year survival rate for premenopausal women who received CMFVP was 49% compared with 33% for premenopausal women who received L-PAM. Among women with > or = 4 positive lymph nodes, the estimated survival rate for patients who received CMFVP was 31% compared with 15% for patients who received L-PAM. Both regimens were tolerated well. Toxicity was more severe and frequent among patients who received CMFVP. CONCLUSIONS: The authors conclude that, after 20 years of follow-up, adjuvant chemotherapy with CMFVP remains superior to L-PAM for the treatment of patients with lymph node positive breast carcinoma.",1

Tamoxifen in treatment of intraductal breast cancer: National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-24 randomised controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: We have shown previously that lumpectomy with radiation therapy was more effective than lumpectomy alone for the treatment of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). We did a double-blind randomised controlled trial to find out whether lumpectomy, radiation therapy, and tamoxifen was of more benefit than lumpectomy and radiation therapy alone for DCIS. METHODS: 1804 women with DCIS, including those whose resected sample margins were involved with tumour, were randomly assigned lumpectomy, radiation therapy (50 Gy), and placebo (n=902), or lumpectomy, radiation therapy, and tamoxifen (20 mg daily for 5 years, n=902). Median follow-up was 74 months (range 57-93). We compared annual event rates and cumulative probability of invasive or non-invasive ipsilateral and contralateral tumours over 5 years. FINDINGS: Women in the tamoxifen group had fewer breast-cancer events at 5 years than did those on placebo (8.2 vs 13.4%, p=0.0009). The cumulative incidence of all invasive breast-cancer events in the tamoxifen group was 4.1% at 5 years: 2.1% in the ipsilateral breast, 1.8% in the contralateral breast, and 0.2% at regional or distant sites. The risk of ipsilateral-breast cancer was lower in the tamoxifen group even when sample margins contained tumour and when DCIS was associated with comedonecrosis. INTERPRETATION: The combination of lumpectomy, radiation therapy, and tamoxifen was effective in the prevention of invasive cancer.",1
Paclitaxel and UFT plus oral calcium folinate in pretreated metastatic breast cancer.,"This phase I study was designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting side effects of combination treatment with paclitaxel (Taxol) and UFT (uracil and tegafur in a 4:1 molar ratio) plus oral calcium folinate (Orzel) for advanced metastatic breast cancer. After premedication, patients received paclitaxel as a 3-hour IV infusion (175 mg/m2) on day 1; UFT was administered orally at 300 mg/day (dose level 1), 400 mg/day (dose level 2), 500 mg/day (dose level 3), or 600 mg/day (dose level 4) in combination with 90 mg/day of calcium folinate in three divided doses for 14 days. Twenty patients with pretreated metastatic breast cancer have entered the trial so far. The main toxicity was neutropenia, occurring in 68% of patients. World Health Organization grades 1 and 2 peripheral neuropathy, arthralgia, and myalgia were common but not dose-limiting. All patients had grade 3 alopecia due to paclitaxel. One of six patients treated at dose level 4 experienced a dose-limiting toxicity with neutropenic fever. But within four dose levels MTD was not reached, and the study will continue to accrue patients to dose level 5. Objective responses were observed at all dose levels. In conclusion, the combination of paclitaxel and UFT plus oral calcium folinate seems to be a convenient and effective regimen for patients with pretreated metastatic breast cancer. Phase I is ongoing in order to determine MTD and the recommended dose for phase II testing.",1
"A phase III randomized trial of cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, and 5-fluorouracil (CNF) versus cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, and 5-fluorouracil (CAF) in patients with metastatic breast cancer.","One hundred patients with metastatic breast cancer were randomly selected to receive combined chemotherapy treatment with adriamycin (50 mg/m2) or mitoxantrone (12 mg/m2) associated with 5-fluorouracil (600 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2) administered intravenously every 21 days with a maximum of ten cycles. All patients included in this study were under 75 years of age and had ECOG performance status of less than 4. They had not been treated previously with chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, which could not have included anthracyclines, had to have relapsed at least 12 months after the completion of therapy. There were no statistically significant differences in pretreatment characteristics or metastatic disease location between the two groups. Ninety-four patients were assessable for response. No differences were observed in response rate or in survival between the groups. The response rate (complete response (CR) and partial response (PR)) was 68% (13% CR and 55% PR for CAF; 0% CR and 68% PR for CNF). Median survival for all patients was 19 months (18 months with CAF and 19 months with CNF). All patients were assessable for toxicity. There were no differences in gastrointestinal and cardiac toxicity. More grade I-II hematologic toxicity episodes (p < 0.001) and treatment delays (p = 0.05) due to leucopenia were observed with the CNF group, and more grade III alopecia (p < 0.001) was observed with the CAF group. Patients received further therapeutic manoeuvres after finishing the study with a sequential treatment consisting of hormonal therapy and chemotherapy with mitomycin (M) -vinblastine (Vbl) (M 10 mg/m2 day 1, Vbl 5 mg/m2 days 1, 15 and 29; maximum 5 cycles). This chemotherapy treatment was received by 32 patients, with a response rate of 34% and grade III-IV hematologic toxicity of 37%. Treatment with CNF can be considered a good alternative to CAF for first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer. M-Vbl treatment is useful as second-line treatment in patients with prior adriamycin exposure.",1
Baseline characteristics of participants in the Raloxifene Use for The Heart (RUTH) trial.,"The Raloxifene Use for The Heart (RUTH) trial is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial designed to determine whether raloxifene 60 mg/day compared with placebo lowers the risk of coronary events (coronary death, nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI], or hospitalized acute coronary syndromes other than MI) and reduces the risk of invasive breast cancer in women at risk for a major coronary event. Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that improves cardiovascular risk factors, reduces the risk of vertebral fracture, and is associated with a reduced incidence of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Between June 1998 and August 2000, 10,101 women were enrolled at 187 sites in 26 countries. Approximately half of the women had documented coronary heart disease (CHD) (n = 5,031); the remainder had multiple CHD risk factors that increased their risk for a CHD event (n = 5,070). The mean age of participants was 68 years (39% were >70 years old), and did not differ between those with documented CHD and those at increased CHD risk. Most women were Caucasian (84%); 60% had a body mass index >/=27 kg/m(2), 46% had diabetes mellitus, 78% had systemic hypertension, and 14% had low-density lipoprotein cholesterol >160 mg/dl. Compared with women at increased CHD risk, women with documented CHD had higher cardiovascular risk scores, a higher prevalence of abnormal electrocardiograms, greater use of cardiovascular medications, were more likely to have had cardiac rehabilitation, and were more likely to have previously used estrogen or oral contraceptives, but had a slightly lower prevalence of CHD risk factors such as smoking, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and systemic hypertension, and had lower serum levels of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The RUTH cohort is the largest group of postmenopausal women at increased risk of CHD events ever assembled in a clinical trial, and is the first trial designed to determine the effect of a selective estrogen receptor modulator on the risk of CHD events.",0
The effect of adjuvant tamoxifen: the latest results from the Cancer Research Campaign Adjuvant Breast Trial. Cancer Research Campaign Breast Cancer Trials Group.,"The CRC Adjuvant Breast Trial, launched in 1980 to repeat both the Nolvadex Adjuvant Trial Organisation tamoxifen trial and the Scandinavian trial of perioperative cyclophosphamide trial, randomised 2230 stage I or II early breast cancer patients in a 2 x 2 factorial design to investigate the benefits of a short course of perioperative cyclophosphamide or tamoxifen daily for 2 years. At a median follow-up of 7.8 years, no significant benefit is noted for perioperative cyclophosphamide, however the main effect analysis for adjuvant tamoxifen demonstrates a significant improvement in disease-free survival which increases with time over the follow-up period. These results are in keeping with the World Overview of Trials of Adjuvant Tamoxifen. However, this study is unique, having a large number of node negative patients and over 500 premenopausal women in a comparison of tamoxifen and control. The relative risk reductions for the node negative patients for disease-free survival are greater than for node positive patients. This might suggest that the absolute benefit for adjuvant tamoxifen is similar in both groups of patients, bearing in mind the increase risk of relapse with node positive patients. No trend for interaction emerges according to age or menopausal status suggesting an identical benefit for pre and postmenopausal women. Similar relative risk reductions are seen when the data are stratified according to tumour size, suggesting a similar positive benefit may be seen for all patients irrespective of tumour size. Of particular interest is the incidence of contralateral breast cancer, the initial overall effect which emerged at the third year of follow-up ceases to be apparent. However subgroup analysis according to menopausal status suggests a trend for interaction with a reduction in the risk of contralateral breast cancer in the postmenopausal women and a marginal increase in the risk of contralateral breast cancer in premenopausal women. Plausible mechanisms exist to explain this difference in outcome and these data need to be confirmed or refuted by other large trials of adjuvant tamoxifen especially at this time when the chemoprophylaxis of breast cancer in high risk premenopausal women by tamoxifen is being considered.",1
High-dose chemotherapy with hematopoietic stem-cell rescue for high-risk breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: The use of high-dose adjuvant chemotherapy for high-risk primary breast cancer is controversial. We studied its efficacy in patients with 4 to 9 or 10 or more tumor-positive axillary lymph nodes. METHODS: Patients younger than 56 years of age who had undergone surgery for breast cancer and who had no distant metastases were eligible if they had at least four tumor-positive axillary lymph nodes. Patients in the conventional-dose group received fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC) every three weeks for five courses, followed by radiotherapy and tamoxifen. The high-dose treatment was identical, except that high-dose chemotherapy (6 g of cyclophosphamide per square meter of body-surface area, 480 mg of thiotepa per square meter, and 1600 mg of carboplatin per square meter) with autologous peripheral-blood hematopoietic progenitor-cell transplantation replaced the fifth course of FEC. RESULTS: Of the 885 patients, 442 were assigned to the high-dose group and 443 to the conventional-dose group. After a median follow-up of 57 months, the actuarial 5-year relapse-free survival rates were 59 percent in the conventional-dose group and 65 percent in the high-dose group (hazard ratio for relapse in the high-dose group, 0.83; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.66 to 1.03; P=0.09). In the group with 10 or more positive nodes, the relapse-free survival rates were 51 percent in the conventional-dose group and 61 percent in the high-dose group (P=0.05 by the log-rank test; hazard ratio for relapse, 0.71; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.50 to 1.00). CONCLUSIONS: High-dose alkylating therapy improves relapse-free survival among patients with stage II or III breast cancer and 10 or more positive axillary lymph nodes. This benefit may be confined to patients with HER-2/neu-negative tumors.",1
"Anastrozole alone or in combination with tamoxifen versus tamoxifen alone for adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer: results of the ATAC (Arimidex, Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination) trial efficacy and safety update analyses.","BACKGROUND: The first analysis of the ATAC (Arimidex, Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination) trial (median follow-up, 33 months) demonstrated that in adjuvant endocrine therapy for postmenopausal patients with early-stage breast cancer, anastrozole was superior to tamoxifen in terms of disease-free survival (DFS), time to recurrence (TTR), and incidence of contralateral breast cancer (CLBC). In the current article, the results of the first efficacy update, based on a median follow-up period of 47 months, are reported along with the results of an updated safety analysis, performed 7 months after the first analysis (median duration of treatment, 36.9 months). METHODS: DFS, TTR, CLBC incidence, and safety were assessed in the same patient group as in the first analysis of the ATAC trial. RESULTS: DFS estimates at 4 years remained significantly more favorable (86.9% vs. 84.5%, respectively) for patients receiving anastrozole compared with those receiving tamoxifen (hazard ratio [HR], 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76-0.99; P = 0.03). The benefit generated by anastrozole in terms of DFS was even greater in patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70-0.96; P = 0.014). The HR for TTR also indicated a significant benefit for patients receiving anastrozole compared with those receiving tamoxifen (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.71-0.96; P = 0.015), with additional benefit for patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65-0.93; P = 0.007). CLBC incidence data also continued to favor anastrozole (odds ratio [OR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.38-1.02; P = 0.062), and statistical significance was achieved in the hormone receptor-positive subgroup (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.32-0.98; P = 0.042). The updated safety analysis also confirmed the findings of the first analysis, in that endometrial cancer (P = 0.007), vaginal bleeding and discharge (P < 0.001 for both), cerebrovascular events (P < 0.001), venous thromboembolic events (P < 0.001), and hot flashes (P < 0.001) all occurred less frequently in the anastrozole group, whereas musculoskeletal disorders and fractures (P < 0.001 for both) continued to occur less frequently in the tamoxifen group. These results indicated that the safety profile of anastrozole remained consistent. CONCLUSIONS: After an additional follow-up period, anastrozole continues to show superior efficacy, which is most apparent in the clinically relevant hormone receptor-positive population. Furthermore, anastrozole has numerous noteworthy advantages in terms of tolerability compared with tamoxifen. These findings suggest that the benefits of anastrozole are likely to be maintained in the long term and provide further support for the status of anastrozole as a valid treatment option for postmenopausal women with hormone-sensitive early-stage breast cancer.",1
Menstrual history and quality-of-life outcomes in women with node-positive breast cancer treated with adjuvant therapy on the NSABP B-30 trial.,"PURPOSE: Premenopausal women with breast cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapy are at risk for amenorrhea. The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-30 trial included menstrual history (MH) and quality-of-life (QOL) studies to compare treatments on these outcomes.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to sequential doxorubicin (A) and cyclophosphamide (C) followed by docetaxel (T; AC→T), concurrent TAC, or AT, which varied in duration (24, 12, 12 weeks, respectively), and use of C. Endocrine therapy was prescribed for women with hormone receptor-positive tumors. MH and QOL were assessed with standardized questionnaires at baseline; cycle 4, day 1; and every 6 months through 24 months. Prespecified analyses examined rates of amenorrhea by treatment arm, the relationship between amenorrhea and QOL, and QOL by treatment arm.RESULTS: Amenorrhea 12 months after random assignment was significantly different between treatment groups: 69.8% for AC→T, 57.7% for TAC, and 37.9% for AT (P < .001). The AT group without tamoxifen had the lowest rate of amenorrhea. QOL was poorer for patients receiving AC→T at 6 months but similar to others by 12 months. Post-treatment symptoms were increased above baseline for all treatments. Multivariable repeated measures modeling demonstrated that treatment arm, time point, age, and tamoxifen use were significantly associated with symptom severity (all P values < .002).CONCLUSION: Amenorrhea rates differed significantly by treatment arm, with the AT arm having the lowest rate. Patients treated with longer duration therapy (AC→T) had greater symptom severity and poorer QOL at 6 months, but did not differ from shorter duration treatments at 12 months.",0
Survival after adjuvant oophorectomy and tamoxifen in operable breast cancer in premenopausal women.,"PURPOSE: Worldwide, approximately 750,000 new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed annually in premenopausal women with limited economic resources. Longer-term survival benefits from adjuvant therapies in such women with operable breast cancer are unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1993 to 1999, we recruited 709 premenopausal women with operable breast cancer to a multisite randomized clinical trial of adjuvant oophorectomy and tamoxifen for 5 years or observation and this combined hormonal therapy on recurrence. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 7.0 years, disease-free and overall survival were significantly improved with the adjuvant treatment (log-rank P = .0003 and .0002, respectively). Five year disease-free survival (DFS) probabilities of 74% and 61% (95% CI for difference, 7% to 21%) and overall survival (OS) rates of 78% and 71% (95% CI for difference, 1% to 21%) were observed in the adjuvant and observation groups. Ten-year DFS probabilities of 62% and 51% (95% CI for difference, 4% to 22%) and OS probabilities of 70% and 52% (95% CI for difference, 6% to 34%) between adjuvant and observation groups, respectively, were observed. In the subset of estrogen receptor-positive patients, 5-year DFS probabilities were 83% and 61%, and 10-year DFS probabilities were 66% and 47%, while 5-year OS probabilities were 88% and 74%, and 10-year OS probabilities were 82% and 49% in the adjuvant and observation groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: In premenopausal women with operable breast cancer not selected for estrogen receptor status or with estrogen receptor-positive tumors, 5- and 10-year DFS and OS rates are significantly improved following adjuvant oophorectomy and tamoxifen.",0
Epirubicin plus tamoxifen versus tamoxifen alone in node-positive postmenopausal patients with breast cancer: A randomized trial of the International Collaborative Cancer Group.,"PURPOSE: To assess whether the addition of epirubicin (EPI) therapy to prolonged treatment with tamoxifen (TAM) improves relapse-free and overall survival in postmenopausal women with node-positive primary breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six hundred four patients entered onto a randomized clinical trial were allocated to receive TAM 20 mg/d for 4 years or TAM 20 mg/d for 4 years plus EPI 50 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1 and 8 every 4 weeks for six cycles. Analysis was performed according to allocated treatment, with all randomized patients included (intention to treat), irrespective of eligibility status. RESULTS: After a median follow-up period of 5.7 years, an improvement in relapse-free survival (RFS) was observed for the TAM and EPI-treated patients, compared with those who received TAM alone. The unadjusted hazard ratio was 0.72 (95% confidence interval, 0.54 to 0.96), with a corresponding reduction in the odds of recurrence of 27.9% (SD, 12. 3), which was statistically significant (P =.023). Adjustment for prognostic and/or predictive factors did not materially affect the hazard ratio. No difference was observed in terms of overall survival (reduction in odds of death, 11.9% [SD, 16.3]; P =.46). Combined chemohormonal treatment was associated with a higher incidence of acute side effects but without a clear increase in long-term cardiotoxicity. Twelve nonbreast second malignancies, including five hematologic malignancies (two of which were cases of acute myelogenous leukemia), were observed. CONCLUSION: The data show that combined chemohormonal treatment reduces the risk of relapse in postmenopausal patients with node-positive breast cancer. No evidence was found, however, for an improvement in overall survival. The size of benefit observed for both outcomes was consistent with that reported in the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group overview. The trial presented here, however, provides the first report of an improvement in RFS associated with the provision of a single cytotoxic drug in addition to prolonged TAM.",1
Comparison of chemotherapy with or without medroxyprogesterone acetate for advanced or recurrent breast cancer.,"The usefulness of CAF [cyclophosphamide (CPA)/doxorubicin (ADR)/5-fluorouracil (5-FU)] + medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) therapy for advanced/recurrent breast cancer was studied in a randomised trial at 56 institutions. Patients received CAF therapy [CPA: 100 mg, orally, days 1-14; ADR: 30 mg/m2, intravenously (i.v.), days 1 and 8; 5-FU: 500 mg/m2, i.v., days 1 and 8) in arm I, or CAF + MPA therapy (CAF + MPA 1200 mg, daily) in arm II. The response rate was significantly higher (P = 0.041) in arm II (53.5%, 46/86) than arm I (36.6%, 30/82). The response rate by tumour site was significantly higher for lymph node and bone lesions in arm II. Partial response duration and overall response duration were significantly longer in arm II. Incidences of anorexia and nausea/vomiting were significantly higher in arm I but in arm II, moon face, oedema and vaginal bleeding were significantly higher. Many patients in arm II demonstrated improvement in performance status and weight loss, suggesting a beneficial effect of MPA. The chemoendocrine therapy with CAF + MPA appears to be more beneficial than CAF alone in the treatment of advanced/recurrent breast cancer.",1
Efficacy of pamidronate in breast cancer with bone metastases: a randomized double-blind placebo controlled multicenter study.,,0
Formestane versus megestrol acetate in postmenopausal breast cancer patients after failure of tamoxifen: a phase III prospective randomised cross over trial of second-line hormonal treatment (SAKK 20/90). Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (SAKK),"The aim of the study was to compare efficacy and tolerability of the new aromatase inhibitor formestane (Lentaron) with megestrol acetate (Megestat) (MGA) in postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer. 179 patients were randomised to receive either 250 mg formestane intramuscularly biweekly or MGA 160 mg orally daily. 51% of the patients had received tamoxifen as adjuvant treatment; 73% of the patients had positive and 16% unknown oestrogen receptor values. The response rate was 17% in both treatment arms (95% confidence interval 10-26% for formestane and 10-27% for MGA). Disease stabilisation > or = 6 months was seen in 25% of the formestane and 22% of the MGA patients. Time to treatment failure was 120 days in the formestane arm and 111 days in the MGA arm. There was no significant difference between the treatments with regard to response rate and time to treatment failure. Overall toxicity was similar in both arms, but weight gain > 3 kg (P = 0.081) and severe cardiovascular toxicity (P = 0.044) were more frequently observed with MGA, e.g. deep vein thrombosis 0/90 formestane versus 5/81 MGA cases (P = 0.022). Formestane was associated with worsening of hot flushes/sleeping problems (P = 0.051) and mild leucopenia (P = 0.004). In our study, formestane and MGA showed similar antineoplastic activity as second-line hormonal treatment for advanced breast cancer. Both drugs have a specific toxicity profile. MGA was associated with significantly more severe cardiovascular toxicity and weight increase than formestane.",1
Effect of oral contraceptive with and without associated estriol on ultrasound measurements of breast fibroadenoma: randomized clinical trial.,"CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Fibroadenomas are the most common benign tumors of the female breast. The aim of this study was to evaluate the proliferative activity of breast fibroadenoma as shown by ultrasound measurements, following administration of oral contraceptives with and without associated estriol. DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial carried out in the Mastology Sector, Department of Gynecology, Universidade Federal de São Paulo. METHODS: We studied 33 women with fibroadenomas. Ten were placed in group 1 and took an oral contraceptive consisting of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol together with placebo material in the same capsule, for four consecutive cycles with a seven-day interval between them. The other 23 patients constituted group 2 and took the oral contraceptive as above together with estriol in the same capsule, in the same way as done by the group 1 patients. We took ultrasound measurements of their tumors (in three dimensions) before and after the intake of medication. At the end of the study, all the patients had their tumors removed by surgery. RESULTS: We observed decreased fibroadenoma width among the users of oral contraceptives with placebo, and this decrease was statistically significant. In the other group, we did not observe any changes (in width, length or height). CONCLUSION: The results confirm that estriol may block the protective effect of oral contraceptives on fibroadenomas, since we observed decreased fibroadenoma width among the group 1 patients but not the group 2 patients.",0
Weekly paclitaxel improved pathologic response of primary chemotherapy compared with standard 3 weeks schedule in primary breast cancer.,"The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of weekly paclitaxel to every-3-week schedule in terms of pathologic response and toxicity which caused treatment delay in primary chemotherapy of breast cancer. After pretreatment of two cycles of cyclophosphamide/ pirarubicin/ fluorouracil (cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2) days 1, 8; pirarubicin 35 mg/m(2) days 1, 8; 5-Fu 200 mg/m(2) day ci day 1-28, every 4 weeks), 219 women with histologically confirmed T(1-3) N(0-2) M(0) invasive breast cancer, whose vertical diameters production of breast tumor reduced not more than 75%, were randomized to receive four cycles of Pq3wC (arm A: paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) day 1, carboplatin AUC 6 d1, every 3 weeks) or Pq1wC (arm B: paclitaxel 60 mg/m(2) days 1, 8, 15, carboplatin AUC 6 day 1 for every 3 weeks) before surgery, stratified by partial or no response (stable disease and progression of disease) evaluated by ultrasonography. Pathologic response of the primary tumor was assessed by using Miller and Payne grading system. We defined grade 4/5 as excellent response, grade 3/4/5 as response and treatment delay as paclitaxel administration being delayed at least 1 week because of toxicity in this study. 213 patients (2 cases with concurrent bilateral breast cancer) were eligible for analysis, 109 patients with 110 lesions in arm A and 104 patients with 105 lesions in arm B. Patients in arm B had a higher excellent pathologic response rate and a higher pathologic response rate compared with patients in arm A (59.0 vs. 45.5%, P = 0.046 and 86.7 vs. 71.8%, P = 0.007). Pathologic complete response (pCR) rate in breast alone was similar between two arms (P = 0.733), but there was a higher pCR rate in patients with partial response to two cycles of cyclophosphamide/pirarubicin/fluorouracil than those with no response (32.4 vs. 13.9%, P = 0.001). There was no treatment-related death, however more patients in arm B than in arm A experienced treatment delay caused by toxicity (60.6 vs. 11.9%, P < 0.001). Under the condition of same cumulative doses, weekly paclitaxel was more effective than 3 weeks schedule in terms of pathologic response to primary chemotherapy in breast cancer, and caused more treatment delay related to toxicity though well tolerant.",1
"PREPARE trial: a randomized phase III trial comparing preoperative, dose-dense, dose-intensified chemotherapy with epirubicin, paclitaxel, and CMF versus a standard-dosed epirubicin-cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel with or without darbepoetin alfa in primary breast cancer--outcome on prognosis.","BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to compare the effect of dose-intensified neoadjuvant chemotherapy with that of standard epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel in combination with or without darbepoetin on survival in primary breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 733 patients received either four cycles of neoadjuvant epirubicin 90 mg/m(2) plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks followed by four cycles of paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks (EC→T), or three cycles of epirubicin 150 mg/m(2) every 2 weeks followed by three cycles of paclitaxel 225 mg/m(2) every 2 weeks followed by three cycles of combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (E(dd)→T(dd)→CMF). The patients were randomly assigned to receive darbepoetin or none. The primary objective was to demonstrate a superior disease-free survival (DFS) of E(dd)→T(dd)→CMF compared with EC→T. RESULTS: Estimated 3-year DFS was 75.8% with EC→T versus 78.8% with E(dd)→T(dd)→CMF [hazard ratio (HR) 1.14; P = 0.37] and overall survival (OS) 88.4% versus 91.5% (HR 1.26; P = 0.237). Three-year DFS was 74.3% with darbepoetin versus 80.0% without (HR 1.31; P = 0.061) and OS 88.0% versus 91.8% (HR 1.33; P = 0.139). Patients with a pathologically documented complete response [pathological complete response (pCR)] had a significantly better DFS compared with those without achieving a pCR (estimated 3-year DFS: 89.2% versus 74.9%; HR 2.27; P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Neoadjuvant dose-intensified chemotherapy compared with standard chemotherapy did not improve DFS, whereas the addition of darbepoetin might have detrimental effects on DFS.",1
Markers of type I collagen degradation and synthesis in the monitoring of treatment response in bone metastases from breast carcinoma.,"Thirty-six patients with bone metastases included in a trial of supportive calcitonin on the treatment response to systemic therapy were monitored by conventional radiography, conventional indicators of bone metabolism [alkaline phosphatase (AP), osteocalcin (gla), urinary hydroxyproline excretion (OHP), urinary calcium (uCa), serum calcium (sCa)] and collagen metabolites (ICTP, the pyridinoline cross-linked carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen; PICP, the carboxy-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen; and PIIINP the amino-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen). All patients had been on the same systemic treatment for at least 3 months at the start of the trial. There was a positive correlation between the concentrations of ICTP and PICP at baseline (Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficient rs = 0.62). Both ICTP and PICP showed statistically significant correlations to the other markers of bone metabolism (except sCa and uCa) as well as to the number of bone metastases on bone scans. Reduction in ICTP correlated significantly with the treatment response at three months (rs = - 0.57). while PICP showed a borderline negative correlation to therapy response (rs = - 0.37). Of all the biochemical parameters studied the changes in ICTP showed the best correlation with the treatment response. PICP and ICTP changes in patients with progressive disease differed significantly from those in patients with responding and stable metastases, whereas no difference was found between responders and stable patients.",0
Neoadjuvant treatment with trastuzumab in HER2-positive breast cancer: results from the GeparQuattro study.,"PURPOSE Trastuzumab, a humanized antibody against the human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2), has shown high efficacy in breast cancer. We prospectively investigated its efficacy given simultaneously with anthracycline-taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with operable or locally advanced, HER2-positive tumors were treated preoperatively with four cycles of epirubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by four cycles of docetaxel with or without capecitabine (EC-T[X]) and trastuzumab 6 mg/kg (with a loading dose of 8 mg/kg) every 3 weeks during all chemotherapy cycles. Patients with HER2-negative tumors treated in the same study with the same chemotherapy but without trastuzumab were used as a reference group. Results Of 1,509 participants, 445 had HER2-positive tumors treated with trastuzumab and chemotherapy. Pathologic complete response (pCR; defined as no invasive or in situ residual tumors in the breast) rate was 31.7%, which was 16% higher than that in the reference group (15.7%). HER2-positive patients without response to the first four cycles of EC showed an unexpectedly high pCR rate of 16.6% (3.3% in the reference group). Breast conservation rate was 63.1% and comparable to that of the reference group (64.7%). EC-T(X) plus trastuzumab was associated with more febrile neutropenia and conjunctivitis, but with a comparable short-term cardiac toxicity profile as the reference group. CONCLUSION This trial confirms that combining trastuzumab with anthracycline-taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy results in a high pCR rate without clinically relevant early toxicity. Combination of chemotherapy with trastuzumab should be considered when neoadjuvant treatment is given to patients with HER2-positive breast cancer.",1
"Drug-induced apoptosis and p53, BCL-2 and BAX expression in breast cancer tissues in vivo and in fibroblast cells in vitro.","BACKGROUND: Chemotherapeutic management of breast cancers is a difficult task as they show significant differences in chemosensitivity. The present study was undertaken to determine the usefulness of the apoptosis-related factors as indicators of tumor sensitivity to 5'-deoxyfluorouridine (5'-DFUR) in breast cancers. METHODS: (1) Forty-six breast cancer patients were randomly assigned to a group in which oral 5'-DFUR (1200 mg/day) was administered for more than 5 days before operation (24 patients) and a control group who received no preoperative chemotherapy (22 patients). Surgical specimens were examined for the frequency of apoptotic cells [apoptotic index (AI)] by a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling method and for the expression of p53, BCL-2 and BAX by immunohistochemical staining. (2) Normal human diploid fetal lung fibroblast, IMR90 and SV40 transformed IMR90 were exposed to 5-FU. Apoptotic cells were detected by flow cytometry and BCL-2 and BAX mRNAs by real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis. RESULTS: (1) No significant difference in the AIs or in BCL-2 and BAX scores was observed between the 5'-DFUR-treated and control groups. However, in the p53 negative subgroup (n = 36), AI and BAX scores were higher and BCL-2 scores lower in the 5'-DFUR group than in the control group (P = 0.006, 0.008 and 0.050, respectively). (2) The sensitivity of IMR90 was significantly decreased by SV40 transformation and the 5-FU-induced cytotoxicity was mainly due to induction of apoptosis. The BCL-2/BAX mRNA ratio was decreased in response to 5-FU in IMR90. These results correlated with our clinical data. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative treatment with 5'-DFUR induced apoptosis and changes in BCL-2 and BAX expression in p53 negative breast cancers. p53 status, AI and the BCL-2/BAX ratio may be useful information for the choice of postoperative chemotherapy for breast cancer.",0
p53 Expression in node-positive breast cancer patients: results from the Cancer and Leukemia Group B 9344 Trial (159905).,"PURPOSE: p53 as a prognostic and predictive factor in early-stage breast cancer has had mixed results. We studied p53 protein expression, by immunohistochemistry, in a randomized clinical trial of stage II patients treated with adjuvant doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide with or without paclitaxel [Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 9344, INT0148]. Patients and Methods: Epithelial p53 expression was evaluated using two immunohistochemical antibodies (DO7 and 1801) in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from patients with node-positive breast cancer who were randomized to four cycles of cyclophosphamide and one of three doses of doxorubicin (60, 75, or 90 mg/m(2); AC) and to receive four subsequent cycles of paclitaxel (T) or not. Prognostic and predictive value of p53 protein expression was assessed, independent of treatment assignment, for escalating doses of doxorubicin or addition of T with endpoints of relapse-free (RFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Of 3,121 patients, 1,887 patient specimens treated on C9344 were obtained, passed quality control, and evaluated for p53 expression. Expression was 23% and 27% for mAbs 1801 and D07, respectively, with 92% concordance. In univariate analysis, p53 positivity was associated with worse OS with either antibody, but only p53 staining with monoclonal antibody 1801 had significantly worse RFS. In multivariate analysis, p53 was not predictive of RFS or OS from either doxorubicin dose escalation or addition of paclitaxel regardless of the antibody. CONCLUSION: Nuclear staining of p53 by immunohistochemistry is associated with worse prognosis in node-positive patients treated with adjuvant doxorubicin-based chemotherapy but is not a useful predictor of benefit from doxorubicin dose escalation or the addition of paclitaxel.",0
Short-term changes in Ki-67 during neoadjuvant treatment of primary breast cancer with anastrozole or tamoxifen alone or combined correlate with recurrence-free survival.,"PURPOSE: Neoadjuvant (preoperative) therapy for breast cancer may allow for the development of intermediate markers of treatment benefit, thereby circumventing the need for efficacy trials of adjuvant therapy, which require much larger patient numbers and longer follow-up. The aim of this study--as part of the Immediate Preoperative ""Arimidex"" (anastrozole), Tamoxifen, or Arimidex Combined with Tamoxifen (IMPACT) trial (n = 330)--was to test the hypotheses that changes in Ki-67 after 2 weeks and/or 12 weeks: (i) differed between treatments, (ii) predicted clinical tumor response, and/or (iii) may predict long-term outcome differences between treatments in adjuvant therapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination (ATAC) trial compared these same agents in the adjuvant setting. Biomarkers were measured in biopsy specimens taken before and after 2 and 12 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: Suppression of the proliferation marker Ki-67 after 2 and 12 weeks was significantly greater with anastrozole than with tamoxifen (P = 0.004 and P < 0.001) but was similar between tamoxifen and the combination (P = 0.600 and P = 0.912). This result closely parallels that seen for the relative recurrence-free survival with the treatments after a median follow-up of 31 months in the ATAC trial in 9,366 patients. Against expectations, apoptosis was not increased in any of the treatment arms. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that short-term changes in proliferation in the neoadjuvant setting may be able to predict outcome during adjuvant use of the same treatments. If this can be confirmed, these findings could lead to a profound change in approaches to drug development in breast cancer. The data indicate that estrogen is not an important survival factor for human breast cancer cells.",0
Dose intensity of standard adjuvant CMF with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for premenopausal patients with node-positive breast cancer.,"The effects of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) on total dose and dose intensity of standard oral adjuvant CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil) chemotherapy were studied in premenopausal patients with node-positive breast cancer. Treatment consisted of standard CMF and locoregional radiotherapy (on indication). G-CSF was administered if the leukocyte count recovery was insufficient. Fifty-one patients required no G-CSF (""no cytopenia'), and 50 patients received G-CSF (""G-CSF). Twenty-two patients, however, received no G-CSF support despite insufficient leukocyte recovery (""control'). Following G-CSF, leukocyte recovery was adequate in 83% of the chemotherapy cycles. The proportion of the patients who had a dose intensity > or = 85% was 90% in the ""no cytopenia' group, 74% in the ""G-CSF' group, and 45% in ""control' group (p < 0.05). Leukocyte recovery was adequate in 87% of the chemotherapy cycles in the patients who received radiotherapy as compared with 92% of those in the patients without radiotherapy (p < 0.05). In conclusion an adequate leukocyte recovery after G-CSF was found in 83% of all chemotherapy cycles. The dose intensity of the G-CSF group was higher as compared with controls. The impact of radiotherapy on hematological recovery was significant, but not dependent on G-CSF.",0
Contrary effects of the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor vandetanib on constitutive and flow-stimulated nitric oxide elaboration in humans.,"Vascular endothelial growth factor regulates neoplastic angiogenesis through production of endothelium-derived NO. We performed a prospective evaluation of vascular function during treatment with vandetanib, a vascular endothelial growth receptor 2 and 3 receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, to determine the effects of vascular endothelial growth receptor signal interruption on endothelial function in humans. Seventeen patients with stage IV breast cancer received dose-escalated vandetanib in combination with low-dose oral chemotherapy. We measured blood pressure, systemic nitrate/nitrite levels, and brachial artery vascular function. In vitro analyses of cultured endothelial cells were performed to determine the effect of vandetanib on NO production, akt(473) phosphorylation, and endothelial NO synthase protein content and membrane localization. Vandetanib treatment for 6 weeks significantly increased blood pressure, decreased resting brachial artery diameter, and decreased plasma systemic nitrate/nitrite levels compared with baseline. Flow-mediated vasodilation was preserved, and no change was noted in nitroglycerin-mediated vasodilation. In vitro, endothelial cell nitrite levels and akt(473) phosphorylation were reduced and vascular endothelial growth receptor 2 levels did not change, but endothelial NO synthase membrane concentration doubled. Vandetanib reduces constitutive NO production and increases blood pressure, yet flow-stimulated NO bioavailability was preserved. Changes in vascular function with tyrosine kinase inhibition are complex and require further study in humans.",0
Phase III trial of concurrent or sequential adjuvant chemoradiotherapy after conservative surgery for early-stage breast cancer: final results of the ARCOSEIN trial.,"PURPOSE: In 1996, we initiated the French multicenter phase III randomized trial to compare the effect on disease-free survival (DFS) of concurrent versus sequential chemotherapy (CT) and radiotherapy (RT) after breast-conserving surgery for stages I and II breast cancer. This report presents the clinical results with a median follow-up of 60 months. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between February 1996 and April 2000, 716 patients were entered onto this trial. Adjuvant treatment began within 6 weeks after surgery. Sequential treatment of CT administered first followed by RT was compared with concurrent treatment of CT administered with RT. The CT regimen consisted of mitoxantrone (12 mg/m2), fluorouracil (500 mg/m2), and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) on day 1, and it was repeated every 21 days for six courses. RT was delivered to the breast and, when indicated, to the regional lymphatics. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in treatment in the 5-year DFS (80% in both groups; P = .83), locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS; 92% in sequential v 95% in concurrent; P = .76), metastasis-free survival (87% in sequential v 84% in concurrent; P = .55), or overall survival (90% in sequential v 91% in concurrent; P = .76). Nevertheless, in the node-positive subgroup, the 5-year LRFS was statistically better in the concurrent arm (97% in concurrent v 91% in sequential; P = .02), corresponding to a risk of locoregional recurrence decreased by 39% (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.93). CONCLUSION: This treatment protocol remains an appealing clinical option for many women with operable breast cancer at a high risk of recurrence. Combination treatments with new drugs for breast cancer are warranted.",1
Capecitabine plus docetaxel combination chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer.,"Doxifluridine(5'-DFUR)is converted to its metabolite 5-FU by the enzyme thymidine phosphorylase(TP). TP is expressed significantly higher in tumor tissue than in normal tissue. Capecitabine(N4-pentoxylcarbonyl -5'-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine)is a pro-drug of 5'-DFUR and a novel fluoropyrimidine carbamate that is converted to 5-FU preferentially in tumor tissue through a three-step enzymatic cascade. Expression of TP in tumor tissue may clinically predict efficacy of capecitabine. Induction of TP activity has brought about enhancement of capecitabine efficacy by taxanes in human cancer xenografts. In addition, a phase III study directly comparison docetaxel monotherapy and docetaxel plus capecitabine has been conducted for metastatic breast cancer patients who had received anthracyclines. The overall response rate of the combination group was 42%(n=255), and that of the monotherapy group was 30%(n=256)(p=0.006). The primary endpoints were time to disease progression, and time to treatment failure, and these parameters were superior in the combination arm than in the single arm, suggesting that capecitabine sensitization by docetaxel might be a new approach to breast cancer treatment.",0
Quality of life and quality-adjusted survival (Q-TWiST) in patients receiving dose-intensive or standard dose chemotherapy for high-risk primary breast cancer.,"Quality of life (QL) is an important consideration when comparing adjuvant therapies for early breast cancer, especially if they differ substantially in toxicity. We evaluated QL and Q-TWiST among patients randomised to adjuvant dose-intensive epirubicin and cyclophosphamide administered with filgrastim and progenitor cell support (DI-EC) or standard-dose anthracycline-based chemotherapy (SD-CT). We estimated the duration of chemotherapy toxicity (TOX), time without disease symptoms and toxicity (TWiST), and time following relapse (REL). Patients scored QL indicators. Mean durations for the three transition times were weighted with patient reported utilities to obtain mean Q-TWiST. Patients receiving DI-EC reported worse QL during TOX, especially treatment burden (month 3: P<0.01), but a faster recovery 3 months following chemotherapy than patients receiving SD-CT, for example, less coping effort (P<0.01). Average Q-TWiST was 1.8 months longer for patients receiving DI-EC (95% CI, -2.5 to 6.1). Q-TWiST favoured DI-EC for most values of utilities attached to TOX and REL. Despite greater initial toxicity, quality-adjusted survival was similar or better with dose-intensive treatment as compared to standard treatment. Thus, QL considerations should not be prohibitive if future intensive therapies show superior efficacy.",0
Zoledronic acid reduces skeletal-related events in patients with osteolytic metastases.,"BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the dose-response relation for zoledronic acid, a new generation high potency bisphosphonate, given as a 5-minute infusion in patients with malignant osteolytic disease. METHODS: Two-hundred eighty patients with osteolytic lesions due to metastatic breast carcinoma or multiple myeloma were randomized to double-blind treatment with either 0.4, 2.0, or 4.0 mg of zoledronic acid or 90 mg pamidronate. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients receiving radiation to bone. Other skeletal-related events, bone mineral density (BMD), bone markers, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, pain and analgesic scores, and safety also were evaluated. RESULTS: Zoledronic acid at doses of 2.0 and 4.0 mg and pamidronate at a dose of 90 mg each significantly reduced the need for radiation therapy to bone (P < 0.05) in contrast with 0.4 mg zoledronic acid, which did not. Skeletal-related events of any kind, pathologic fractures, and hypercalcemia also occurred less frequently in patients treated with 2.0 or 4.0 mg zoledronic acid or pamidronate than with 0.4 mg zoledronic acid. Increases in lumbar spine BMD (6.2-9.6%) and decreases in the bone resorption marker N-telopeptide (range, -37.1 to -60.8%) were observed for all treatment groups. Skeletal pain, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and headache were the most commonly reported adverse events. Adverse events were similar in nature and frequency with zoledronic acid and pamidronate. CONCLUSIONS: A 5-minute infusion of 2.0-4.0 mg zoledronic acid was at least as effective as a 2-hour 90-mg pamidronate infusion in treatment of osteolytic metastases. A 0.4-mg dose of zoledronic acid was significantly less effective. Both zoledronic acid and pamidronate were well tolerated.",0
High-dose versus low-dose cyclophosphamide in combination with G-CSF for peripheral blood progenitor cell mobilization.,"BACKGROUND: To compare the mobilizing effects and toxicities of two different doses of cyclophosphamide (CY) plus lenograstim (glycosylated G-CSF), we performed a prospective randomized study by enrolling patients suffering with either high-risk Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) or breast cancer undergoing ablative chemotherapy. METHODS: The NHL patients received 4 cycles of CHOP and the breast cancer patients received 2-3 cycles of FAC (FEC) adjuvant chemotherapy. Then, the patients were randomly allocated to receive CY 4 g/m2 (arm A) or 1.5 g/m2 (arm B) in combination with lenograstim. Large volume leukapheresis was carried out and it was continued daily until the target cell dose of 2 x 10(6) CD34+ cell/kg was reached. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients were enrolled in the study. The median number of leukaphereis sessions actually performed was 2.5 sessions in arm A and 3 sessions in arm B. The target cell dose was obtained with the median number of one leukapheresis session in both arms of the study (p=0.09). The collected number of CD34+ cells in the leukapheresis products was higher in arm A than arm B (22.4 vs. 9.9 x 10(6)/kg, respectively, p=0.05). Grade III or IV leukopenia was present in 14/15 patients (94%) in arm A and in 1/12 patients (8%) in arm B (p<0.0001). Grade Ill or IV thrombocytopenia was present in 8/15 patients (54%) in arm A, but this was not present in any patients of arm B (p=0.0004). Neutropenic fever occurred in 6/15 patients (40%) in arm A, and in 1/12 patients (8%) in arm B (p=0.09). The hematological recovery of the leukocytes and platelets after transplantation was not statistically different between the two doses. CONCLUSION: Low-dose CY plus lenograstim is a safe and effective mobilizing regimen.",0
Myocyte cell damage after administration of doxorubicin or mitoxantrone in breast cancer patients assessed by indium 111 antimyosin monoclonal antibody studies.,"PURPOSE: To compare myocyte cell damage induced by doxorubicin or mitoxantrone, we performed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measurements and indium 111 antimyosin antibody studies in a group of patients with advanced breast cancer who had been treated with these anthracycline derivatives. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 35 patients eligible to receive chemotherapy including the anthracyclines: doxorubicin or mitoxantrone (cumulative dose of doxorubicin, 500 mg/m2; or mitoxantrone, 120 mg/m2). LVEF was measured before and after 10 cycles of chemotherapy. Antimyosin uptake in the myocardium was quantified by means of a heart-to-lung ratio (HLR). RESULTS: Patients treated with doxorubicin presented with a significant decrease in LVEF after chemotherapy (before, 60.4% +/- 8.92%; after, 49.8% +/- 9.71%; P = .001). Antimyosin uptake was observed in all patients with a HLR of 2.03 +/- 0.25. Seven of eight patients with a HLR greater than 2.03 had a greater than 10% decrease in LVEF. Patients treated with mitoxantrone did not present with a decrease in LVEF after chemotherapy (before, 55.4% +/- 6.25%; after, 55.8% +/- 7.25%; not significant). Antimyosin uptake was observed in 14 of 17 patients with a HLR of 1.77 +/- 0.18 (P < .05). CONCLUSION: 111In antimyosin monoclonal antibodies defect myocardial cell damage produced by doxorubicin and mitoxantrone. In patients with advanced breast cancer, cumulative doses of 120 mg/m2 of mitoxantrone produce less myocardial cell damage than cumulative doses of 500 mg/m2 of doxorubicin. 111In antimyosin uptake without decrease in LVEF after treatment with mitoxantrone indicates the presence of myocyte cell damage, but not to the extent necessary to deteriorate function. These results indicate that 111In antimyosin antibody studies are useful in the noninvasive comparative assessment of cardiotoxicity produced by different anthracycline derivatives.",0
Uracil/tegafur plus oral calcium folinate in advanced breast cancer.,"Uracil and tegafur (in a molar ratio of 4:1 [UFT]) has proven activity against breast cancer and is delivered in an easy-to-administer oral formulation. Orzel, which combines UFT with the oral biomodulator, calcium folinate, may provide even greater antitumor efficacy against breast cancer. Here, we describe the preliminary results of this phase II trial investigating the feasibility of 250 mg/m2/day of UFT plus 45 mg/day of oral calcium folinate administered to highly pretreated patients with advanced breast cancer. The results indicate a highly tolerable regimen and an overall response rate of 27.8% in a group of poor-prognosis patients. These findings warrant continued investigation.",1
Bisphosphonates for osteoporosis treatment are associated with reduced breast cancer risk.,"BACKGROUND: Bisphosphanates are used primarily for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, and are also indicated for osseous complications of malignancy. In addition to their bone resorption properties, the most commonly used nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate compounds also inhibit protein prenylation, and thus may exert anti-tumour properties.METHODS: To evaluate whether the use of these drugs may be associated with cancer, specifically breast cancer, we conducted a population-based case-control study in Wisconsin from 2003 to 2006. Participants included 2936 incident invasive breast cancer cases and 2975 population controls aged < 70 years. Bisphosphonate use and potential confounders were assessed by interview.RESULTS: Using multivariable logistic regression, the odds ratio for breast cancer in current bisphosphonate users compared with non-users was 0.67 (95% confidence interval 0.51-0.89). Increasing duration of use was associated with a greater reduction in risk (P-trend=0.01). Risk reduction was observed in women who were not obese (P-interaction=0.005).CONCLUSION: These results are suggestive of an additional benefit of the common use of bisphosphonates, in this instance, the reduction in breast cancer risk.",0
Phase III multicenter trial of doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel compared with doxorubicin plus paclitaxel followed by weekly paclitaxel as adjuvant therapy for women with high-risk breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: This study compared disease-free survival (DFS) obtained with two different regimens of adjuvant therapy in high-risk breast cancer. METHODS: Women (who had performance status [PS] of 0 to 1) with operable, histologically confirmed, stage I to III adenocarcinoma of the breast were eligible. Patients had undergone primary surgery with no residual tumor. Treatments were as follows: arm 1 was doxorubicin 60 mg/m(2) plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks for four cycles followed by paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks for four cycles (ie, AC-P); and arm 2 was doxorubicin 50 mg/m(2) plus paclitaxel 200 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks for four cycles followed by paclitaxel 80 mg/m(2) weekly for 12 weeks. RESULTS: Overall, 1,830 patients were enrolled and 1,801 were treated: arm 1 (n = 906; AC-->P) and arm 2 (n = 895; AP-WP). Overall, patients had a PS of 0 (88%), had estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor-positive disease (52%), had one to three positive nodes (46%), and were postmenopausal (57%); the median age was 52 years. Currently, 1,640 patients (90%) are alive. The 6-year DFS was 79% to 80% in both groups. Disease relapse was the cause of death for 83 patients in arm 1 and in 66 patients of arm 2. Overall 6-year survival rates were 82% and 87% in arms 1 and 2, respectively. Reasons for patients being taken off study treatment included toxicity (13% in arm 1 v 20% in arm 2), progressive disease or recurrence (7% v 5%), and consent withdrawn (9% v 8%), respectively. The most frequent toxicities were hematologic, including neutropenia and leukopenia followed by neuropathy, myalgia, nausea, fatigue, headache, arthralgia, and vomiting. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the AP-WP regimen is an equally effective and tolerable option for the adjuvant treatment of patients with high-risk breast cancer. The substitution of paclitaxel for cyclophosphamide results in comparable effectiveness of the regimen.",1
"erbB-2, p53, and efficacy of adjuvant therapy in lymph node-positive breast cancer.","BACKGROUND: We have previously reported that high expression of the erbB-2 gene (also known as HER-2/neu and ERBB2) in breast cancer is associated with patient response to dose-intensive treatment with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin (Adriamycin), and 5-flurouracil (CAF) on the basis of short-term follow-up of 397 patients (set A) with axillary lymph node-positive tumors who were enrolled in Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) protocol 8541. METHODS: To validate those findings, we conducted immunohistochemical analyses of erbB-2 and p53 protein expression in an additional cohort of 595 patients (set B) from CALGB 8541, as well as a molecular analysis of erbB-2 gene amplification in tumors from all patients (sets A and B). Marker data were compared with clinical, histologic, treatment, and outcome data. RESULTS: Updated analyses of data from set A (median follow-up, 10.4 years) showed an even stronger interaction between erbB-2 expression and CAF dose, by use of either immunohistochemical or molecular data. A similar interaction between erbB-2 expression and CAF dose was observed in all 992 patients, analyzed as a single group. However, for set B alone (median follow-up, 8.2 years), results varied with the method of statistical analysis. By use of a proportional hazards model, the erbB-2 expression-CAF dose interaction was not significant for all patients. However, in the subgroups of patients randomly assigned to the high- or the moderate-dose arms, significance was achieved. When patient data were adjusted for differences by use of a prognostic index (to balance an apparent failure of randomization in the low-dose arm), the erbB-2 expression-CAF dose interaction was significant in all patients from the validation set B as well. An interaction was also observed between p53 immunopositivity and CAF dose. CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis that patients whose breast tumors exhibit high erbB-2 expression benefit from dose-intensive CAF should be further validated before clinical implementation. Interactions between erbB-2 expression, p53 expression, and CAF dose underscore the complexities of predictive markers where multiple interactions may confound the outcome.",0
Variability of patterns of fatigue and quality of life over time based on different breast cancer adjuvant chemotherapy regimens.,"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationships among fatigue and physical and mental quality of life (QOL) and different adjuvant chemotherapy regimens in patients with stage I-IIIA breast cancer prior to, during, and after treatment. DESIGN: Longitudinal, descriptive design embedded in a randomized, clinical trial. SETTING: Outpatient oncology clinics in the midwestern United States. SAMPLE: 196 postoperative women, mean age of 52 years, receiving anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens: dose-dense taxane, dose-standard taxane, or dose-standard without taxane. METHODS: The Piper Fatigue Scale and Medical Outcomes Study SF-36(R) (v.2) Survey were completed 48 hours prior to treatment 1, at treatments 4 and 8, and 30 days after the final treatment. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Fatigue, adjuvant chemotherapy regimen, and QOL. FINDINGS: Fatigue and mental QOL changed significantly over time for all regimens, but the patterns of change did not differ based on regimen. Physical QOL changed significantly over time for all regimens, and the pattern of change differed based on whether taxanes were received. Higher fatigue was correlated with lower physical and mental QOL prior to and 30 days after the final treatment, regardless of regimen. CONCLUSIONS: Women who receive taxanes are at higher risk for lower physical QOL over time. Higher fatigue was associated with lower QOL regardless of the chemotherapy regimens. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Clinicians should screen patients for fatigue and assess for contributing factors at clinic visits. Methods to integrate evidence-based fatigue interventions into practice should be tested and outcomes evaluated.",0
The ratio of positive to excised nodes identifies high-risk subsets and reduces inter-institutional differences in locoregional recurrence risk estimates in breast cancer patients with 1-3 positive nodes: an analysis of prospective data from British Columbia and the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center.,"PURPOSE: To examine the power of the nodal ratio (NR) of positive/excised nodes in predicting postmastectomy locoregional recurrence (LRR) in patients with 1-3 positive nodes (N+) and in identifying cohorts at similar risk across independent data sets. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Data from 82 patients with 1-3 N+ treated without postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) in the British Columbia (BC) randomized trial were compared with data from 462 patients treated without PMRT in prospective chemotherapy trials at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). Kaplan-Meier LRR curves were compared between centers using the absolute number of N+ and nodal ratios. RESULTS: The median number of excised nodes was 10 in BC and 16 in MDACC (p < 0.001). Examining LRR by number of N+, the 10-year LRR rate for patients with 1-3 N+ was higher in BC compared with MDACC (21.5% vs. 12.6%; p = 0.02). However, when examining LRR using NR, no differences were found between institutions. In patients with NR < or = 0.20, the 10-year LRR rate was 17.7% BC vs. 10.9% MDACC (p = 0.27). In patients with NR > or = 0.20, the 10-year LRR rate was 28.7% BC vs. 22.7% MDACC (p = 0.32). On Cox regression analysis, NR was a stronger prognostic factor compared with number of N +. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with 1-3 N+, evaluating nodal positivity using NR reduced inter-institutional differences in LRR estimates that may exist due to variations in numbers of nodes excised. Nodal ratio >0.20 was associated with LRR >20%, warranting PMRT consideration. Nodal ratio may be useful for extrapolating data from prospective trials to clinical practices in which axillary staging extent vary.",0
Treatment of skeletal disease in breast cancer: a controlled clodronate trial.,"Normocalcaemic breast cancer patients with progressive osteolytic bone metastases were treated with clodronate 1.6 g/day (17) or placebo (17) for 12 months. Bone pain, extension of bone metastases and formation of new osteolytic foci were reduced by clodronate, and development of severe hypercalcaemia was prevented. After withdrawal of treatment the patients were followed-up for at at least 12 months. New bone metastases developed in both groups. There were, however, less fractures and less hypercalcaemia in the clodronate than in the placebo group. The survival rate was higher in the clodronate group than in the placebo group. No haematological toxicity was observed in the clodronate group.",0
Possible deleterious effect of tamoxifen in premenopausal women with locoregional recurrence of breast cancer.,"Tamoxifen (TAM) treatment following isolated locoregional recurrence of breast cancer significantly increases 5-year disease-free survival rates compared with observation alone in potentially hormone-responsive patients [J Clin Oncol 1994, 12, 2071-2077]. The treatment outcome was re-analysed by menopausal status (stratification factor) in 35 premenopausal and in 132 postmenopausal patients. Disease progression was highly reduced by tamoxifen in the postmenopausal group and was similar to control in the premenopausal group. However, the 5-year cumulative incidence analysis of the type of first failure showed TAM to be associated with increased incidence of distant metastases (P = 0.01) in premenopausal patients. TAM reduced local progression (P = 0.40) in premenopausal and both types of failure (P = 0.16 and P = 0.001, respectively) in postmenopausal patients. Administration of TAM was associated with a decrease of 5-year overall survival from 90 +/- 7% to 60 +/- 14% in premenopausal patients. Although cautious interpretation of these results is highly recommended due to the small patient numbers and the retrospective subset analyses, these findings might be worthy of further investigation in larger trials. Prospective randomised studies to test hormonal treatment outcome by menopausal status should be encouraged in breast cancer.",0
Tumor-associated lymphocytes as an independent predictor of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer.,"PURPOSE Preclinical data suggest a contribution of the immune system to chemotherapy response. In this study, we investigated the prespecified hypothesis that the presence of a lymphocytic infiltrate in cancer tissue predicts the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS We investigated intratumoral and stromal lymphocytes in a total of 1,058 pretherapeutic breast cancer core biopsies from two neoadjuvant anthracycline/taxane-based studies (GeparDuo, n = 218, training cohort; and GeparTrio, n = 840, validation cohort). Molecular parameters of lymphocyte recruitment and activation were evaluated by kinetic polymerase chain reaction in 134 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples. Results In a multivariate regression analysis including all known predictive clinicopathologic factors, the percentage of intratumoral lymphocytes was a significant independent parameter for pathologic complete response (pCR) in both cohorts (training cohort: P = .012; validation cohort: P = .001). Lymphocyte-predominant breast cancer responded, with pCR rates of 42% (training cohort) and 40% (validation cohort). In contrast, those tumors without any infiltrating lymphocytes had pCR rates of 3% (training cohort) and 7% (validation cohort). The expression of inflammatory marker genes and proteins was linked to the histopathologic infiltrate, and logistic regression showed a significant association of the T-cell-related markers CD3D and CXCL9 with pCR. CONCLUSION The presence of tumor-associated lymphocytes in breast cancer is a new independent predictor of response to anthracycline/taxane neoadjuvant chemotherapy and provides useful information for oncologists to identify a subgroup of patients with a high benefit from this type of chemotherapy.",0
Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in patients with breast cancer: a cytological and colposcopic study.,"Twenty-six patients with treated breast cancer who had been randomised previously to receive combination chemotherapy including alkylating agents (n = 14) or to undergo oophorectomy (n = 12) following surgery underwent cytological and colposcopic screening of the uterine cervix. Colposcopically directed cervical punch biopsies were taken from all patients in whom a colposcopic abnormality was detected. Breast cancer patients were compared with 79 controls with normal cervical cytology and no known breast malignancy. Colposcopically directed punch biopsies were taken from the cervical transformation zone of all controls. Significantly more breast cancer patients who had received chemotherapy (43%) than controls (10%) had CIN (P < 0.01) and significantly more patients who had received chemotherapy (14%) than controls (3%) had CIN 2 or 3 (P < 0.05). The proportion of breast cancer patients in the oophorectomy group with CIN (17%) did not differ significantly from the control group. No case of CIN was detected by cervical cytology. This study suggests that breast cancer patients receiving combination chemotherapy including alkylating agents are at increased risk of CIN, and that cervical cytology alone may be an inadequate form of screening for these patients.",0
Dose-dense paclitaxel-containing adjuvant therapy for breast cancer.,"The use of dose-dense therapy is one approach to overcoming the ""resistance"" of malignant cells to adjuvant therapy caused by inadequate drug exposure. In this approach, active drugs are delivered sequentially at their ""ideal"" dose level separated by short intertreatment intervals. Thus, dose intensification is achieved by means of rapidly recycled treatments rather than by dramatic dose escalation. To overcome absolute cellular resistance, the addition of new, active, non-cross-resistant drugs holds great promise and has specifically motivated the testing of the taxanes. This article describes the results of clinical trials of dose-dense therapy, with particular emphasis on attempts to incorporate one taxane, paclitaxel (Taxol), into the dose-dense regimen of sequential doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide--the so called A-->T-->C regimen, and into more conventional regimens.",0

Prophylaxis with a cream containing urea reduces the incidence and severity of radio-induced dermatitis.,"INTRODUCTION: Radio-induced dermatitis is one of the most frequent side effects of radiotherapy. Among the commercially available products for the care of irradiated skin is a hydrating lotion containing 3% urea, polidocanol and hyaluronic acid. Its effectiveness for preventing the appearance of radiodermatitis or reducing its severity has been studied on a number of occasions. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of ""intensive use"" of the lotion containing 3% urea, polidocanol and hyaluronic acid for preventing the appearance of acute radiodermatitis and controlling its severity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective observational study in 98 patients with breast cancer with a 10-week follow-up period. Skin toxicity (RTOG/EORTC scale) was evaluated weekly. To study the effectiveness we compared incidence and grade of toxicity with a sample of 174 breast cancer patients (control sample) treated in our centre during 2006 who used skin-support measures at the start of the radiotherapy or the occurrence of radiodermatitis. RESULTS: The proportion of patients who did not develop radiodermatitis was significantly higher in the intensive use group (27.6% vs. 15.5%; p<0.05; OR: 2.07). Compared with the same lotion in standard conditions, the intensive use group showed lower incidence of radiodermatitis (p<0.01), lower grade of toxicity (p<0.001) and lower proportion of radiodermatitis grade 2 or higher (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Intensive use of the lotion doubles the likelihood that breast cancer patients will not develop radiodermatitis during radiotherapy. Furthermore, compared with standard use, intensive use is more effective in reducing the incidence of skin toxicity and skin toxicity grade 2 or higher.",0
An evaluation of a computer-imaging program to prepare women for chemotherapy-related alopecia.,"OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to evaluate a computer program named Help with Adjustment to Alopecia by Image Recovery (HAAIR) that was developed to provide educational support and reduce distress in women with hair loss following chemotherapy.METHODS: Forty-five women who had been diagnosed with cancer and anticipated alopecia following treatment were randomly assigned to either the Imagining group (IG) or Standardized Care group (SCG). Patients in the IG used a computer-imaging program that created the patient's image on a screen to simulate baldness and use of wigs whereas patients in the SCG were directed to a resource room at the Cancer Center established for women with chemotherapy-related alopecia. Assessment data using the Brief Symptom Inventory, Importance of Hair Questionnaire, and the Brief Cope were completed at baseline (T1), before chemotherapy and hair loss, following hair loss (T2), and 3 months follow-up (T3).RESULTS: All women were able to successfully use the touch screen computerized-imaging program and reported that using the computer was a positive, helpful experience, thus establishing acceptability and usability. Women in both the IG and the SCG group showed significantly lower hair loss distress scores at T2 after hair loss than at T1 with T3 distress scores increasing in the SCG and decreasing in the IG. Those with avoidance coping reported more distress.CONCLUSIONS: This evaluation demonstrates that the HAAIR program is a patient-endorsed educational and supportive complement to care for women facing chemotherapy-related alopecia.",0
Cost of managing anemia with and without prophylactic epoetin alfa therapy in breast cancer patients receiving combination chemotherapy.,"The cost of managing anemia with prophylactic epoetin alfa therapy versus blood transfusions in breast cancer patients receiving combination chemotherapy was studied. A retrospective study of anemia in breast cancer patients treated with four cycles of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin with fluorouracil (CAF) or without fluorouracil (CA) was conducted. For each cycle of chemotherapy, patients were assessed for fatigue, subsequent blood transfusions administered, and potential response to and adverse effects of blood transfusions. Transfusions were given at the prescriber's discretion rather than in accordance with standard guidelines. The lowest hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit of each patient per cycle were reported. Data on these patients, along with data from published studies of prophylactic use of epoetin alfa, were used in a decision analysis of the costs associated with using epoetin alfa versus red blood cell transfusions to manage anemia. The charts of 50 patients were reviewed. In the study group, the percentage of patients with anemia and the frequency of fatigue rose with each chemotherapy cycle. In general, blood transfusions were not used. The cost of using epoetin alfa prophylactically for all four cycles was estimated at $6483 per patient for the literature-based group versus $169 for the study group. The cost of managing anemia in breast cancer patients was substantially lower when blood transfusions were used than when epoetin alfa was given prophylactically throughout four cycles of therapy with CAF or CA; the absence of standard guidelines for transfusion might have exaggerated the difference in costs.",0
"Comparative effects of three cytokine regimens after high-dose cyclophosphamide: granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and sequential interleukin-3 and GM-CSF.","PURPOSE: To compare the toxicity and effects on hematologic recovery and circulating progenitor cell mobilization of three cytokine regimens administered after high-dose cyclophosphamide (HD-CTX; 6 g/m(2)), given as the first step of a high-dose sequential chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients with breast cancer or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were randomized to receive granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) alone (arm 1), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) alone (arm 2), or sequential interleukin-3 (IL-3) and GM-CSF (arm 3). Cytokines were administered as a single daily subcutaneous injection at a dose of 5 to 6 microg/kg/d. Progenitor cells were evaluated in peripheral blood as well as in apheretic product as both CD34(+) cells and granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM). RESULTS: Neutrophil recovery was faster in arm 1 as compared with arms 2 and 3 (P <.0001); no significant differences were observed between arms 2 and 3. In arm 3, a moderate acceleration of platelet recovery was observed, but it was statistically significant only as compared with arm 1 (P =.028). The peak of CD34(+) cells was hastened in a median of 2 days in arm 1 compared with arms 2 and 3 (P =.0002), whereas the median peak value of CD34(+) cells and CFU-GM was similar in the three patient groups. Administration of IL-3 and GM-CSF resulted in more significant toxicity requiring pharmacologic treatment in 90% of patients. CONCLUSION: The three cytokine regimens administered after HD-CTX are comparably effective in reducing hematologic toxicity and mobilizing the hematopoietic progenitor cells. G-CSF accelerates leukocyte recovery and progenitor mobilization. Although G-CSF-treated patients have somewhat slower platelet recovery, they definitely have fewer side effects.",0
Comparison of mitozantrone and epirubicin in advanced breast cancer.,"Forty chemotherapy naive patients with metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer were treated in a randomized trial comparing mitozantrone 14 mg/m2 with epirubicin 75 mg/m2 given intravenously at 3-weekly intervals. There was a 40% (95% confidence interval (CI) 8-72; P = 0.013) higher partial response rate with epirubicin (11/18) than with mitozantrone (4/19). Epirubicin caused significantly more alopecia (difference 76%; 95% CI 57-96; P < 0.0001) and nausea/vomiting (difference = 38%; 95% CI 10-67; P = 0.01). Three patients who received long courses of epirubicin experienced cardiac failure; two were proved to have cardiomyopathy. The median survival for the epirubicin and mitozantrone groups were 9.5 and 8 months respectively. Thus, although epirubicin gave a higher response rate it also caused more toxicity.",1
"Adjuvant cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil in node-positive breast cancer: the results of 20 years of follow-up.","BACKGROUND: Adjuvant combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil was administered after radical mastectomy for primary breast cancer with histologically positive axillary lymph nodes to assess whether it would improve treatment outcome as compared with surgery alone. Here we report a 20-year follow-up of this investigation. METHODS: In 1973 we began a trial involving 386 women who were randomly assigned to receive either no further treatment after radical mastectomy (179 women) or 12 monthly cycles of adjuvant combination chemotherapy (207 women). All patients were admitted to the Istituto Nazionale Tumori in Milan, Italy. Adjuvant chemotherapy was delivered in the outpatient clinic of the Division of Medical Oncology. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 19.4 years, the patients given adjuvant combination chemotherapy had significantly better rates of relapse-free survival (unadjusted relative risk of relapse, 0.71; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.56 to 0.90; P = 0.004; adjusted relative risk, 0.65, 95 percent confidence interval, 0.51 to 0.83; P < 0.001) and total survival (unadjusted relative risk of death, 0.78; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.62 to 0.99; P = 0.04; adjusted relative risk, 0.76; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.97; P = 0.03). With the exception of postmenopausal women, a benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy was evident in all subgroups of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The long-term results of this trial of adjuvant combination chemotherapy confirm our preliminary observations of the effectiveness of the treatment in women with node-positive breast cancer.",1
Effects of a home-based walking program on perceived symptom and mood status in postoperative breast cancer women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy.,"AIM: This paper is a report of a study analysing the effect of a home-based walking exercise program on symptoms and mood distress among breast cancer women receiving chemotherapy postoperatively.BACKGROUND: Treatment-related symptoms, mood distress and decline in physical activity have been identified as major complaints among cancer patients. Studies on the efficacy of home-based walking exercise for symptoms and mood did not fully describe the exercise prescriptions that could be safe and beneficial for women with breast cancer, especially these receiving adjuvant chemotherapy.METHOD: This is a prospective, randomized clinical trial. In 2008-2009, participants were recruited from the oncology outpatient clinic of a medical center in Taiwan, and were assigned to either the exercise group (n=19) or the control group (n=21). Women in the exercise group participated in a moderate-intensity home-based walking program for 12 weeks during their chemotherapy treatments. Symptoms, mood status and physical activity level were measured at baseline, 6- and 12-week follow-up. Data were analysed by two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance.RESULTS: Women in the exercise group reported significantly lower symptom severity scores and mood disturbance compared with those in the control group throughout the study period.CONCLUSION: Regular moderate-intensity exercise can play an important role in improving treatment-related symptoms and mood in women with breast cancer. A home-based walking exercise program can be easily incorporated into care for women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy.",0
Evaluation of the prognostic value of HER-2 and VEGF in breast cancer patients participating in a randomized study with dose-dense sequential adjuvant chemotherapy.,"PURPOSE: To assess the prognostic and predictive significance of HER-2 overexpression and high expression of VEGF in high-risk patients with breast cancer treated with dose-dense sequential chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From June 1997 until November 2000, 595 patients were randomized to three cycles of epirubicin (E) 110 mg/m2 followed by three cycles of paclitaxel (T) 250 mg/m2 followed by three cycles of ""intensified"" CMF (cyclophosphamide 840 mg/m2, methotrexate 47 mg/m2 and fluorouracil 840 mg/m2) or to four cycles of E, followed by four cycles of CMF. HER-2 was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 394 patients, and by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in cases scored as 2+ by IHC. VEGF was evaluated in 323 patients by IHC. RESULTS: HER-2 overexpression was detected in 123 patients (31%) and high expression of VEGF in 233 (72%). The rate of HER-2 overexpression was significantly higher in patients with positive VEGF staining (35% vs. 21%, p=0.02). Overexpression of HER-2 was significantly associated with negative hormonal status, high histologic grade and larger tumors. HER-2 overexpression was a significant negative predictor of DFS (p=0.002), but not of OS. Adjusting for HER-2 overexpression, DFS and OS did not significantly differ between treatment groups. Positive VEGF staining was not associated with receptor status, number of positive nodes, grade, tumor size, incidence of relapse or death. CONCLUSIONS: For both treatments, HER-2 overexpression was a significant negative prognostic factor for DFS but not for OS, while high expression of VEGF was not significantly associated to either DFS or OS. No predictive ability of HER-2 status or VEGF overexpression for T treatment was evident.",0
"Leuprorelin acetate every-3-months depot versus cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil as adjuvant treatment in premenopausal patients with node-positive breast cancer: the TABLE study.","PURPOSE: Ovarian suppression with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists is an effective adjuvant treatment for premenopausal women with estrogen receptor (ER) -positive breast cancer. Whereas monthly LHRH agonist therapy has been well established, the value of every-3-months (3-monthly) formulations is unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This randomized phase III trial was performed to compare the 3-monthly depot LHRH agonist leuprorelin acetate (LAD-3M; n = 299) and chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF; n = 300) in pre- or perimenopausal patients with ER-positive, node-positive breast cancer. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 5.8 years, recurrence-free survival was similar for patients treated with LAD-3M or CMF (hazard ratio [HR], 1.19; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.51; P = .15). There was no substantial heterogeneity in the relative treatment effect among subgroups defined by age, progesterone receptor (PR) status, nodal status, hormone levels, or menstrual recovery after treatment. Exploratory overall survival analysis favored LAD-3M (HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.99; P = .005). Chemotherapy-related adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, and alopecia were more common with CMF, whereas symptoms of estrogen suppression such as hot flushes and sweating were initially more pronounced with LAD-3M. CONCLUSION: The 3-monthly depot LHRH-agonist leuprorelin acetate is an effective adjuvant treatment in premenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive, node-positive breast cancer that is not inferior to CMF.",1

The use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors following peripheral blood progenitor cell rescue after high-dose chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer: a prospective study.,"The use of high-dose chemotherapy followed by hematopoietic rescue is increasing worldwide for solid tumors. Several studies have suggested that the period of absolute neutrophil count (ANC, < 500/ml) may be shortened in patients who receive peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC). To estimate the clinical value of granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor, we examined a cohort of 26 consecutive patients with advanced breast cancer who received one or two cycles of high-dose chemotherapy with PBPC rescue with or without filgrastim. Thirty-five courses of high-dose ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide) chemotherapy were administered and evaluated. All patients received PBPC rescue. Sixteen patients (21 courses) received subcutaneous filgrastim (5 mg/kg) following PBPC infusion. Recovery to > or = 500 ANC occurred at a median time of 7 days post PBPC infusion among patients who received filgrastim versus 10 days among patients who received standard support care only (P < 0.01). The administration of filgrastim was not associated with a reduction in the duration of hospitalization, in the total number of days on nonprophylactic antibiotics, number of red blood cell transfusions, time to platelet engraftment, or number of febrile days. This could be the consequence of the high hematopoietic cell dose administered in the study. Therefore, any effect of filgrastim was probably masked by the use of a large number of PBPC. Larger prospective randomized studies, specifically focused on the utility of the administration of growth factors following high-dose chemotherapy and PBPC rescue, may be warranted to know whether the administration of filgrastim after PBPC transplantation is really necessary.",0
"A randomized trial of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone versus cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil, and prednisone in patients with metastatic breast cancer.","Ninety-four patients were entered in a clinical trial assessing the clinical activity of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (CAP) versus a combination of cyclophosphamide. 5-Fluorouracil, and prednisone (CFP) in patients with advanced breast cancer. Objective response rates were comparable, 49% for CFP and 46% for CAP. There was no statistical difference between the duration of response of the two regimens or in time to progression. Most importantly, survival differences were not apparent. Both regimens were clinically tolerable and toxicities, for the most part, were comparable. Thus, no therapeutic advantage existed for either of these polychemotherapy regimens in patients with advanced breast cancer.",1
Helping patients make informed choices: a randomized trial of a decision aid for adjuvant chemotherapy in lymph node-negative breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, patients have indicated a desire for more information about their disease and to be involved in making decisions about their care. We developed an aid called the ""Decision Board"" to help clinicians inform patients with lymph node-negative breast cancer of the risks and benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy. We determined whether adding the Decision Board to the medical consultation improved patient knowledge and satisfaction compared with the medical consultation alone. METHODS: Between October 1995 and March 2000, 176 women with lymph node-negative breast cancer who were candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive the Decision Board plus the medical consultation (83 patients) or the medical consultation alone (93 patients). One week after the consultation, patients completed a questionnaire assessing their knowledge about breast cancer and chemotherapy. Satisfaction with decision making was assessed 1 week and 3, 6, and 12 months after randomization, and differences between groups were analyzed by a repeated measures analysis of variance. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Patients in the Decision Board arm were better informed about breast cancer and adjuvant chemotherapy than patients in the control arm (mean knowledge score = 80.2 [on a scale of 0-100], 95% confidence interval [CI] = 77.1 to 83.3, and 71.7, 95% CI = 69.0 to 74.4, respectively; P<.001). Over the entire study period, satisfaction with decision making was higher for patients in the Decision Board arm than for patients in the control arm (P =.032). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the number of patients who chose adjuvant chemotherapy (77% and 70% for patients in the Decision Board arm and those in the control arm, respectively; P =.303). CONCLUSION: When making decisions regarding adjuvant chemotherapy, patients with early breast cancer who had been exposed to the Decision Board had better knowledge of the disease and treatment options and greater satisfaction with their decision making than those who received the standard consultation.",0
"Biomarker changes during neoadjuvant anastrozole, tamoxifen, or the combination: influence of hormonal status and HER-2 in breast cancer--a study from the IMPACT trialists.","PURPOSE: To investigate the relationships between biomarker changes in breast cancer during neoadjuvant (preoperative) endocrine therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The IMPACT trial compared the preoperative use of tamoxifen with anastrozole alone or in combination in postmenopausal women (n = 330) with primary breast cancer. Biomarkers were measured in tumor biopsy specimens taken at baseline, and after 2 and 12 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: 52 (93%) of 56, 46 (85%) of 54, and 37 (84%) of 44 patients in the anastrozole, tamoxifen, and combination groups, respectively. There was a significantly greater suppression of Ki67 in the anastrozole-treated group than in the tamoxifen- or combination-treated groups, which is parallel to the greater efficacy seen for anastrozole over these two treatments in the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination adjuvant trial. A positive relationship was noted between estrogen-receptor level and Ki67 suppression in all patients. Ki67 was reduced to a greater extent in progesterone receptor-positive tumors compared with progesterone receptor-negative tumors. HER-2-negative tumors tended to show a greater reduction in Ki67 compared with HER-2-positive tumors, but the difference was only significant in the tamoxifen group after 2 weeks, and in the anastrozole group after 12 weeks. CONCLUSION: These results confirm the value of Ki67 as a molecular marker, and provide information regarding the relationships between treatment-induced changes in Ki67 and other important biomarkers. Studies such as this should help integrate agents targeted at growth factor signaling with endocrine agents in breast cancer.",0
Randomized phase II trial of letrozole and letrozole plus low-dose metronomic oral cyclophosphamide as primary systemic treatment in elderly breast cancer patients.,"PURPOSE: To investigate the activity of letrozole plus/minus oral metronomic cyclophosphamide as primary systemic treatment (PST) in elderly breast cancer patients. METHODS: One hundred fourteen consecutive elderly women with T2-4 N0-1 and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer were randomly assigned to primary letrozole therapy (2.5 mg daily for 6 months) or a combination of letrozole plus oral cyclophosphamide (50 mg/daily for 6 months) in an open-labeled, randomized phase II trial. Tumor response was assessed clinically, and tumor Ki67 index and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) -A levels were measured before and after treatment. RESULTS: Overall response rate was 71.9% (95% CI, 60.0 to 83.8) in the 57 patients randomly assigned to receive primary letrozole and 87.7% (95% CI, 78.6 to 96.2) in the 57 patients randomly assigned to receive letrozole plus cyclophosphamide. The difference in activity between treatment arms was predominantly confined to patients with ductal histology. There was a significantly greater suppression of Ki67 and VEGF-A expression in the letrozole/cyclophosphamide-treated group than in the letrozole-treated group, leading to lower Ki67 and VEGF expression at post-treatment residual histology (P = .03 and P = .002, respectively). CONCLUSION: Both letrozole and letrozole plus cyclophosphamide treatments appeared active as PST in elderly breast cancer patients. Metronomic scheduling of cyclophosphamide may have an antiangiogenic effect and the combination of letrozole plus cyclophosphamide warrants testing in a randomized phase III trial.",1
Dose-dense adjuvant chemotherapy in early breast cancer patients: results from a randomized trial.,"BACKGROUND: To determine whether a dose-dense regimen improves outcome in early breast cancer patients, we compared outcomes with the same fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC) chemotherapeutic regimen administered every 3 weeks (FEC21) or administered every 2 weeks (FEC14 including support with filgrastim, a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) in a multicenter phase III randomized trial. METHODS: A total of 1214 patients with early-stage breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive six cycles of FEC14 (604 patients) or of FEC21 (610 patients). Study endpoints were overall survival and event-free survival. Associations were assessed by multivariable analysis with adjustment for age; tumor size; grade; proliferative rate; and menopausal, lymph node, estrogen receptor, and progesterone receptor status. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Patients in the FEC14 arm had fewer dose reductions or treatment delays or discontinuation (26%) than those in the FEC21 arm (33%) (difference = 7%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2% to 12%; P = .008). FEC14 therapy, compared with FEC21 therapy, was associated with more asthenia (36% versus 29%, difference = 7%, 95% CI = 2% to 12%; P = .01), bone pain (33% versus 4%, difference = 29%, 95% CI = 25% to 33%; P < .001), anemia (38% versus 19%, difference = 19%, 95% CI = 14% to 24%; P < .001), and thrombocytopenia (8% versus 2%, difference = 6%, 95% CI = 4% to 9%; P < .001), but with less leukopenia (12% versus 45%, difference = 33%, 95% CI = 28% to 37%; P < .001). No acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome was observed. At a median follow-up of 10.4 years, no statistically significant difference in the hazard of death (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.67 to 1.13) or recurrence (HR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.71 to 1.08) was found between FEC14 and FEC21 groups after adjustment by multivariable analysis. Although the study was underpowered for subset analysis, we found no evidence that the effect of the treatment type was associated with any of the potential prognostic factors. CONCLUSION: Our results support the long-term safety of FEC14 chemotherapy as an adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. However, this therapy was not associated with improved outcome, but because of the limited statistical power of our study, we cannot rule out a modest improvement in outcome associated with FEC14 therapy.",1

A randomized trial on the use of ultrasonography or office hysteroscopy for endometrial assessment in postmenopausal patients with breast cancer who were treated with tamoxifen.,"OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to compare the screening effectiveness and acceptability of transvaginal ultrasonography (with sonohysterography if endometrial thickness was >4 mm) with office hysteroscopy. STUDY DESIGN: This randomized crossover study comprised 53 consecutive asymptomatic (without vaginal bleeding) postmenopausal patients with breast cancer who had taken tamoxifen (20 or 40 mg/day) for at least 6 months. RESULTS: Two patients had endometrial cancer (1 primary, 1 breast secondary), both detected only by transvaginal ultrasonography. Twenty-six patients had at least 1 polyp (total 47, all benign). The women who had polyps were not significantly different in their age, body mass, months of tamoxifen intake, or the cumulative dose. The sensitivity and specificity of transvaginal ultrasonography were 85% and 100%, respectively. The corresponding values for office hysteroscopy were 77% and 92%. It was significant that more patients preferred transvaginal ultrasonography to hysteroscopy (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Transvaginal ultrasonography (plus sonohysterography) may be more effective and acceptable than office hysteroscopy for detecting endometrial abnormalities in women taking tamoxifen.",0
"Second line endocrine treatment of postmenopausal advanced breast cancer. Preliminary endocrine results of a 5-arm randomized phase II trial of medium vs low dose aminoglutethimide, with or without hydrocortisone vs hydrocortisone alone (EORTC 10861).","The supposed mechanism of action of aminoglutethimide (AG), medical adrenalectomy, has been challenged. AG is now considered to act as an inhibitor of the aromatization of mainly adrenal androgens to estrogens in peripheral tissues and/or breast cancer itself. To further establish the AG dose required to sufficiently reduce estrogen levels in plasma and the possible role of hydrocortisone (HC) in combination with AG or by itself, postmenopausal advanced breast cancer patients received AG low (125 mg bid) or medium (250 mg bid) dose alone or combined with HC (20 mg bid) or HC alone (20 mg bid). Preliminary hormonal data show a similar reduction of serum estrone and estrone sulphate by at least some 50% at 8 wk in all treatment groups. At 6 months these effects persist except for patients treated with HC alone. In the latter a normalization of estrone levels is observed with effective suppression of adrenal androgen precursors, suggesting increased aromatase activity with prolonged glucocorticoid treatment.",0
A randomized phase III comparative trial of immediate consolidation with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell support compared to observation with delayed consolidation in women with metastatic breast cancer and only bone metastases following intensive induction chemotherapy.,"The prognosis for patients with metastatic breast cancer remains poor. Metastatic breast cancer confined to the bones may have a better prognosis, especially hormone receptor-positive disease. We performed a prospective, randomized clinical trial to compare immediate consolidation with high-dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic support versus observation with high-dose consolidation at the time of disease progression in women with metastatic breast cancer and only bone metastases. The patients received chemotherapy with doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil and methotrexate before randomization. In all, 85 patients were enrolled and 69 were randomized. The median follow-up is 8.1 years from randomization. The median event-free survival (EFS) for the immediate transplant arm is 12 months and for the observation arm is 4.3 months (P<0.0001). The median overall survival for the immediate transplant arm is 2.97 years and for the observation arm 1.81 years, a difference that is not statistically significant. Immediate high-dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy as consolidation offers a clinically and statistically significant improvement in EFS compared with radiation therapy alone following induction chemotherapy for women with metastatic breast cancer confined to the bones.",0
Anti-apoptotic phenotype is associated with decreased locoregional recurrence rate in breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: Tumor stage and nodal status are the most important factors predicting locoregional recurrence in breast cancer. We wanted to investigate the prognostic value of some newer molecular genetic markers for the occurrence of a locoregional recurrence, in order to improve the selection of patients for locoregional adjuvant therapy. METHODS: Bcl-2, p53, MIB-1, pS2 and CD44v6 were determined immunohistochemically on formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded tumour tissues of 163 patients treated by modified radical mastectomy between 1982 and 1987. Postoperative irradiation was given to 35 patients to the intermammary chain only and to only 13 (8%) patients to the chest wall with or without the regional lymph nodes. Node-positive patients were treated with CAF adjuvant chemotherapy and were randomized for whether or no additional Medroxyprogesteroneacetate (MPA). A multivariate analysis was performed on a number of potential prognostic factors. The risk for locoregional recurrence was estimated using the competing risk approach. RESULTS: After a median period of 7.5 years 28 patients developed a locoregional recurrence. The cumulative incidence of loco-regional recurrence at 10 years was 17%. Bcl-2 and p53 were found to be independent factors predicting locoregional recurrence, whereas a trend was found for MIB-1. Increased Bcl-2 as well as p53 expression were associated with a decreased risk, whereas the increased presence of MIB-1 was associated with an increased risk. CONCLUSION: Results indicate that molecular markers of apoptosis as well as proliferation provide additional information for the risk of locoregional recurrence after modified radical mastectomy. If confirmed, these markers may play a role in the selection of appropriate locoregional adjuvant treatment after primary surgery.",0
Change in tumor cellularity of breast carcinoma after neoadjuvant chemotherapy as a variable in the pathologic assessment of response.,"BACKGROUND: Complete pathologic response of breast carcinoma to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a well defined outcome that correlates with prolonged survival. Categorization of incomplete response depends on accurate measurement of residual tumor size but is complicated by the variable histopathologic changes that occur within the tumor bed. In the current study, the authors investigated the contribution of assessing tumor cellularity in the pathologic evaluation of response to chemotherapy. METHODS: The slides from diagnostic core needle biopsy and the subsequent matched resection specimens were examined in 240 patients with breast carcinoma: 120 ""treated"" patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 120 ""control"" patients who received primary surgical management within a few weeks of diagnosis. Clinical response and residual tumor size were evaluated in 108 treated patients who completed a clinical trial with paclitaxel and then received combined 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy. Tumor cellularity was assessed from hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue sections as the percentage of tumor area that contained invasive carcinoma. RESULTS: After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, tumor cellularity decreased from a median of 40% in core needle biopsy to 10% in resection specimens (P<0.01; Wilcoxon signed rank test). The cellularity of core needle biopsy (median, 30%) tended to underestimate the cellularity of resection specimens (median, 40%) in the control group (P<0.01). Changes in cellularity varied within each clinical response category, particularly partial response and minor response. The greatest reduction was observed in the cellularity of residual primary tumors that measured < or =1 cm (pathologic T1a [pT1a] and pT1b tumors), but changes in cellularity varied in the pT1, pT2, and pT3 residual tumor categories. The shape of the distribution of tumor size, expressed as the greatest dimension in cm, was similar in the control group and the treatment group (excluding complete pathologic response); however, when residual tumor size and cellularity were combined, the distribution of pathologic response shifted left (toward complete response) with a steep decline, suggesting that many tumors had a large reduction in cellularity but little change in the tumor size. CONCLUSIONS: Cellularity of the tumor mass was reduced significantly by neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and the change varied widely in different categories of clinical response. Although residual tumors measuring < or =1 cm in greatest dimension had the most reduction in tumor cellularity, there was broad variability for all residual tumor groups (pT1-pT3). The frequency distribution of residual tumor size was altered markedly by the inclusion of tumor cellularity, indicating that the product of pathologic size and tumor cellularity may provide more accurate pathologic response information than tumor size alone.",0
"Effect of low-dose prophylactic dopamine on high-dose cisplatin-induced electrolyte wasting, ototoxicity, and epidermal growth factor excretion: a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial.","PURPOSE: To evaluate the protective effect of low-dose dopamine given as continuous infusion in patients who undergo chemotherapy with the nephrotoxin cisplatin. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients who received high-dose cisplatin-containing chemotherapy entered a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Twenty-one patients received dopamine, and 21 received placebo. Patients were to receive either infusional dopamine 2 micrograms/kg/min over 48 hours or placebo. Cisplatin 125 mg/m2 was administered 12 hours after initiating dopamine (group D) or placebo (group P). This schedule was repeated twice, 1 week apart. Measurements of serum creatinine, urinary electrolytes and creatinine, urinary excretion of epidermal growth factor (EGF), ototoxicity, parameters of hematopoietic recovery, and duration of hospitalization were analyzed. RESULTS: We observed an increase in serum creatinine level to a peak of 1.9 mg/dL (range, 0.8 to 7.8) in the dopamine group, in comparison to 1.4 mg/dL (range, 0.9 to 3.3) in the placebo group (P = .04). Urinary magnesium excretion increased and EGF excretion decreased in both groups. Urinary sodium, chloride, and potassium excretion were increased in both groups, but more so in the placebo group. Dopamine had no measurable effect on hearing loss, duration of hospitalization, or hematopoietic recovery. CONCLUSION: The use of prophylactic dopamine increased peak serum creatinine levels relative to placebo and failed to prevent cisplatin-induced renal toxicity or ototoxicity. Determination of whether dopamine could reverse chemotherapy-induced renal damage would require a randomized prospective trial.",0
Changes in biological markers after primary chemotherapy for breast cancers.,"The profiles of functional (proliferative rate and cell distribution in the cell cycle) and phenotypic (nuclear DNA content and hormone receptor status) biological markers and the expression of P53 and Bcl-2 proteins were prospectively evaluated in breast cancers before and after different regimens of primary chemotherapy. Overall, changes induced on the 2 proliferation indices (3H-thymidine labelling index, 3H-dT LI, and flow-cytometric S-phase fraction, FCM-S) mainly consisted of a decrease for rapidly proliferating tumours and an increase or no change for slowly proliferating tumours. However, when considered as a function of treatment type, changes of 3H-dT LI and FCM-S were superimposable in rapidly proliferating tumours, regardless of the type of treatment, and in slowly proliferating tumours only after anthracycline-including regimens. Conversely, following CMF, FCM-S was increased in 90% of the cases and 3H-dT LI in only 50%. Our data imply that the 2 proliferation indices could reflect different phenomena: an actual variation of proliferative activity by 3H-dT LI and an accumulation of cells in the S-phase by FCM-S. In addition, a higher accumulation of cells in G2-M phases could be detected by FCM after anthracycline-including regimens than after CMF. The fraction of P53-positive cells was reduced by primary chemotherapy in about 50% of P53-positive tumours, whereas Bcl-2 expression was only marginally affected. DNA ploidy and hormone receptor status did not change in about 75% of cases, regardless of the chemotherapeutic regimen.",0
Fifteen-year results of a randomized phase III trial of fenretinide to prevent second breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: The synthetic retinoid fenretinide administered for 5 years for prevention of second breast cancer showed no difference after a median of 8 years, but a possible reduction in premenopausal women. We conducted a long-term analysis in a subgroup of women who were regularly followed up in a single center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed data after a median follow-up of 14.6 years (IQ range, 12.3-16.3 years) from 1739 women aged 30-70 (872 in the fenretinide arm and 867 in the observation arm), representing 60% of the initial cohort of 2867 women. The main efficacy endpoint was second primary breast cancer (contralateral or ipsilateral). RESULTS: The number of second breast cancers was 168 in the fenretinide arm and 190 in the control arm (hazard ratio = 0.83, 95% CI, 0.67-1.03). There were 83 events in the fenretinide arm and 126 in the observation arm in premenopausal women (HR = 0.62, 95% CI, 0.46-0.83), and 85 and 64 events in postmenopausal women (HR = 1.23, 95% CI, 0.63-2.40). The younger were the women, the greater was the risk reduction associated with fenretinide, which attained 50% in women aged 40 years or younger and disappeared after age 55 (P-age*treatment interaction = 0.023). There was no difference in cancers in other organs, distant metastases or survival. CONCLUSIONS: Fenretinide induces a significant risk reduction of second breast cancer in premenopausal women, which is remarkable at younger ages, and persists several years after treatment cessation. Since adverse events are limited, a trial in young women at high-risk is warranted.",1
Current status of Milan adjuvant chemotherapy trials for node-positive and node-negative breast cancer.,"This report summarizes the most important clinical results achieved at the Milan Cancer Institute through various randomized trials with systemic adjuvant chemotherapy. In the study testing surgery versus surgery plus 12 cycles of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) in node-positive patients, the reduction in failure rate (34%) significantly favored CMF-treated patients (P less than 0.001). Despite a reduction in the death rate of 23%, the overall survival showed only a trend for CMF compared to surgery alone (P = 0.10). In a second study, the 8-year results confirmed the lack of difference in relapse-free survival and total survival rates between patients who received 12 and 6 cycles of CMF. The third study indicated that at 6 years, postmenopausal women who had 1-3 positive lymph nodes and were treated with full-dose sequential non-cross-resistant combinations had rates of relapse-free survival and total survival that were superior to those previously achieved with CMF in the same menopausal subset. In a limited series of patients with negative axillary nodes as well as negative estrogen receptors, there was clear evidence of very poor prognosis in women given only local-regional therapy, compared to women treated with adjuvant CMF. Within the node-negative subset, the proliferative activity (labeling index) of the primary tumor appears to be a more effective prognostic discriminant than estrogen receptor status. The proportion of primary drug-resistant tumor cells as well as the lack of relative dose intensity in the drug programs tested so far probably represent the two most important causes for the failure of adjuvant chemotherapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0
Pulmonary toxicity after radiotherapy in primary breast cancer patients: results from a randomized chemotherapy study.,"PURPOSE: Pulmonary toxicity was prospectively evaluated within a randomized trial for breast cancer patients at high risk for relapse, who postoperatively received as adjuvant therapy either 9 cycles of tailored chemotherapy (20 patients) (cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, 5-fluorouracil [FEC]) or standard FEC x 3 followed by high-dose chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, carboplatin [CTCb]) supported by peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (14 patients). After high-dose chemotherapy or tailored FEC, all patients received locoregional radiotherapy (50 Gy/5 weeks), plus tamoxifen for 5 years. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Lung function tests (FVC, FEV1, and DL(CO)) were performed before chemotherapy and 9 months after radiotherapy. Computed tomography of the lungs was performed before radiotherapy and 6 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months after radiotherapy. RESULTS: Clinical signs of suspected pneumonitis were noted in 29% of patients, but only 1 patient needed symptomatic therapy. Radiologic changes were detected in 68% of patients, and they were most frequent at 3 months after radiotherapy. FVC decreased in both groups (tailored FEC: mean difference, -6.5%, p = 0.0005; CTCb: -2.0%, p = 0.21; tailored FEC vs. CTCb: -4.5%, p = 0.05). DL(CO) decreased significantly in both groups (tailored FEC: mean difference, -11.2%, p < 0.0001; CTCb: -5.6%, p = 0.02; tailored FEC vs. CTCb: -5.6%, p = 0.07). FEV1 decreased by 7.3% in patients treated with tailored FEC (p < 0.0001) and by 2.5% in patients treated with CTCb (p = 0.03) (tailored FEC vs. CTCb: 3.7%, p = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: Changes in pulmonary function were thus detected in both groups, although to a greater extent in the tailored FEC group. The clinical significance of these findings should be balanced carefully against the improved, statistically significant relapse-free survival achieved with the tailored FEC regimen compared to high-dose CTCb + peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PSCT).",0
Patterns of locoregional failure in patients with operable breast cancer treated by mastectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy with or without tamoxifen and without radiotherapy: results from five National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project randomized clinical trials.,"PURPOSE: To assess patterns of locoregional failure (LRF) in lymph node-positive (LN+) breast cancer patients treated with mastectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy (+/- tamoxifen) and without postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) in five National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project trials. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined 5,758 patients enrolled onto the B-15, B-16, B-18, B-22, and B-25 trials. Median follow-up time was 11.1 years. Distribution of pathologic tumor size was < or = 2 cm, 2.1 to 5 cm, and more than 5 cm in 30%, 52%, and 11% of patients, respectively. Distribution of the number of LN+ was one to three, four to nine, and > or = 10 in 51%, 32%, and 16% of patients, respectively. Ninety percent of patients received doxorubicin-based chemotherapy. RESULTS: The overall 10-year cumulative incidences of isolated LRF, LRF with or without distant failure (DF), and DF alone as first event were 12.2%, 19.8%, and 43.3%, respectively. Cumulative incidences for LRF as first event with or without DF for patients with one to three, four to nine, and > or = 10 LN+ were 13.0%, 24.4%, and 31.9%, respectively (P < .0001). For patients with a tumor size of < or = 2 cm, 2.1 to 5.0 cm, and more than 5.0 cm, these incidences were 14.9%, 21.3%, and 24.6%, respectively (P < .0001). Multivariate analysis showed age, tumor size, premenopausal status, number of LN+, and number of dissected LN as significant predictors for LRF as first event. CONCLUSION: In patients with large tumors and four or more LN+, LRF as first event remains a significant problem. Although PMRT is currently recommended for patients with four or more LN+, it may also have value in selected patients with one to three LN+. However, in the absence of a randomized trial examining the worth of radiotherapy in this group of patients, the value of PMRT remains unknown.",0
Exemestane is superior to megestrol acetate after tamoxifen failure in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer: results of a phase III randomized double-blind trial. The Exemestane Study Group.,"PURPOSE: This phase III, double-blind, randomized, multicenter study evaluated the efficacy, pharmacodynamics, and safety of the oral aromatase inactivator exemestane (EXE) versus megestrol acetate (MA) in postmenopausal women with progressive advanced breast cancer who experienced failure of tamoxifen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 769 patients were randomized to EXE 25 mg/d (n = 366) or MA (n = 403) 40 mg four times daily. Tumor response, duration of tumor control, tumor-related signs and symptoms (TRSS), quality of life (QOL), survival, and tolerability were evaluated. RESULTS: Overall objective response (OR) rates were higher in patients treated with EXE than in those treated with MA (15.0% v 12.4%); a similar trend was noted in patients with visceral metastases (13.5% v 10.5%). Median survival time was significantly longer with EXE (median not reached) than with MA (123.4 weeks; P =.039), as were the median duration of overall success (OR or stable disease > or = 24 weeks; 60.1 v 49.1 weeks; P =.025), time to tumor progression (20.3 v 16.6 weeks; P =.037), and time to treatment failure (16.3 v 15.7 weeks; P =.042). Compared with MA, there were similar or greater improvements in pain, TRSS, and QOL with EXE. Both drugs were well tolerated. Grade 3 or 4 weight changes were more common with MA (17.1% v 7.6%; P =.001). CONCLUSION: EXE prolongs survival time, time to tumor progression, and time to treatment failure compared with MA and offers a well-tolerated treatment option for postmenopausal women with progressive advanced breast cancer who experienced failure of tamoxifen.",1
"Antithrombin III level, fibrinogen level, and platelet count changes with adjuvant tamoxifen therapy.","Adjuvant therapy for breast cancer with tamoxifen is suggested to be of benefit to both women with negative and women with positive axillary nodes, and treatment lasting several years is currently being investigated. Venous thrombophlebitis may complicate tamoxifen treatment at a rate of approximately one per 800 treatment-years. To explore the possible mechanisms of this effect, we evaluated changes in antithrombin III levels, fibrinogen levels, and platelet counts in 140 postmenopausal women with surgically resected breast cancer who were disease free and participating in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized toxicity study of tamoxifen. Antithrombin III levels, elevated at baseline evaluation, decreased in tamoxifen-treated subjects at 6 months, but no subject exhibited a drop to clinically significant levels. Fibrinogen levels decreased 15% (0.4 g/L) in tamoxifen-treated subjects at 6 months. Platelet counts decreased 7% to 9% from baseline to evaluations at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months in tamoxifen-treated subjects. While these changes do not explain the possible small thrombophlebitis-promoting effect of tamoxifen, the decrease in fibrinogen levels might be expected to be associated with a decreased risk of arterial thrombosis.",0
"A prospective, randomized Phase III trial comparing combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and 5-fluorouracil with vinorelbine plus doxorubicin in the treatment of advanced breast carcinoma.","BACKGROUND: A prospective, multicenter, randomized, Phase III trial comparing the efficacy of combination chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) with a combination of vinorelbine and doxorubicin (NA) in the treatment of patients with advanced breast carcinoma was undertaken. METHODS: One hundred and seventy-seven patients who previously were untreated for recurrent or metastatic breast carcinoma were entered into the study; 7 patients could not be assessed. The final analysis relates to 85 patients who were treated with FAC and 85 patients who were treated with NA, of whom 21 (25%) and 44 (52%), respectively, had received prior adjuvant chemotherapy. RESULTS: The overall response rates were similar for the two treatments and were unaffected by prior exposure to adjuvant therapy; overall response rate (ORR) for FAC was 74% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 65-83%), and the ORR for NA was 75% (95% CI, 66-84%). The activity of NA in patients with liver involvement was greater than that of FAC in terms of survival. Overall survivals were similar, with a median of 17.3 months for patients receiving FAC and 17.8 months for patients receiving NA. Severe toxicity was uncommon with World Health Organization Grade 3-4 neutropenia affecting only 7% of patients in each arm of the study. NA was associated with a higher incidence of mild to moderate constipation, neurotoxicity, and phlebitis, whereas FAC produced a slight excess of mild cardiotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of these two regimens is very similar, although NA may be more active in a subset of patients with visceral metastatic disease, particularly liver involvement. It is clear that, in a direct comparison with an established three-drug regimen, the newer two-drug combination of NA demonstrated equivalent activity with no significant excess of Grade 3-4 toxicity.",1
Neoadjuvant therapy with gemcitabine in breast cancer.,"Primary systemic therapy (ie, preoperative or neoadjuvant) increases the possibility for breast-conserving surgery in patients with primary breast cancer. Patients with pathologic complete response to primary systemic therapy have improved survival compared with those with persistent tumors. Several phase II trials have evaluated gemcitabine-containing doublet or triplet regimens as primary systemic therapy for breast cancer, results of which have shown promising clinical and pathologic response rates with manageable toxicity. Results of a phase I/II study of gemcitabine (Gemzar)/epirubicin (Ellence)/docetaxel (Taxotere), or GEDoc, with prophylactic filgrastim (Neupogen), as primary systemic therapy in 77 evaluable patients with primary breast cancer are reported herein. Dose-limiting toxicities were grade 3 febrile neutropenia (n = 1) and grade 3 diarrhea (n = 2) at the fourth dose level of GEDoc tested (gemcitabine at 800 mg/m2 days 1 and 8, epirubicin at 90 mg/m2 day 1, and docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 day 1). As assessed by ultrasound, 92% of patients responded overall (22% complete response), and 79% of patients could undergo breast-conserving surgery. The pathologic complete response rate in resected breast tissue was 26%.",1
Dose and dose intensity as determinants of outcome in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. The Cancer and Leukemia Group B.,"BACKGROUND: Both total dose and dose intensity of adjuvant chemotherapy are postulated to be important variables in the outcome for patients with operable breast cancer. The Cancer and Leukemia Group B study 8541 examined the effects of adjuvant treatment using conventional-range dose and dose intensity in female patients with stage II (axillary lymph node-positive) breast cancer. METHODS: Within 6 weeks of surgery (radical mastectomy, modified radical mastectomy, or lumpectomy), 1550 patients with unilateral breast cancer were randomly assigned to one of three treatment arms: high-, moderate-, or low-dose intensity. The patients received cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and 5-fluorouracil on day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle, with 5-fluorouracil administration repeated on day 8. The high-dose arm had twice the dose intensity and twice the drug dose as the low-dose arm. The moderate-dose arm had two thirds the dose intensity as the high-dose arm but the same total drug dose. Disease-free survival and overall survival were primary end points of the study. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 9 years, disease-free survival and overall survival for patients on the moderate- and high-dose arms are superior to the corresponding survival measures for patients on the low-dose arm (two-sided P<.0001 and two-sided P = .004, respectively), with no difference in disease-free or overall survival between the moderate- and the high-dose arms. At 5 years, overall survival (average +/- standard error) is 79% +/- 2% for patients on the high-dose arm, 77% +/- 2% for the patients on the moderate-dose arm, and 72% +/- 2% for patients on the low-dose arm; disease-free survival is 66% +/- 2%, 61% +/- 2%, and 56% +/- 2%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Within the conventional dose range for this chemotherapy regimen, a higher dose is associated with better disease-free survival and overall survival.",1
Final results of ERASME-4: a randomized trial of first-line docetaxel plus either capecitabine or epirubicin for metastatic breast cancer.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of capecitabine plus docetaxel (XT) versus epirubicin plus docetaxel (ET) as first-line therapy for metastatic breast cancer (MBC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with no prior chemotherapy for MBC were randomized to 3-weekly cycles of either XT (capecitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) twice daily, days 1-14; docetaxel 75 mg/m(2), day 1) or ET (epirubicin 75 mg/m(2), day 1; docetaxel 75 mg/m(2), day 1). The primary endpoint was non-progression rate 6 months after randomization. The planned sample size was 106 patients based on a randomized, phase II selection design. RESULTS: Between April 2004 and January 2007, 68 patients were randomized, giving 82% power to select the best regimen according to a 6-month non-progression rate. Slow accrual led to premature study termination. Baseline characteristics were generally well balanced between arms. The 6-month non-progression rates were 75.8% with XT versus 65.7% with ET (p = 0.36). After 42 months' median follow-up, median progression-free survival was 12.4 versus 6.8 months, respectively (p = 0.040). The safety profiles were consistent with previous experience. CONCLUSION: Further larger studies are warranted to validate these results. Despite more grade 3 hand-foot syndrome, first-line XT may be a valid alternative to ET, potentially improving efficacy.",1
The effect of systemic adjuvant chemotherapy on local breast recurrence in node positive breast cancer patients treated by lumpectomy without radiation.,"A randomised trial has previously been repeated in which 437 women with node positive breast cancer received either a 12-week chemohormonal regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil, vincristine, prednisone, adriamycin and tamoxifen or 36 weeks of CMFVP. The present analysis concerns the local recurrence rates for the 122 lumpectomy patients who did not receive breast irradiation. The cumulative rate of local breast recurrence was greater in the 12-week than the 36-week group, P = 0.02. Similarly, in the lumpectomy patients, the cumulative rate of distant recurrence was greater in the 12-week than the 36-week group, P = 0.04. In conclusion, our results suggest that adjuvant chemotherapy impacts on local breast recurrence in a similar manner to other sites in Stage II breast cancer patients treated by lumpectomy without radiation. Despite the use of a conventional 36-week adjuvant chemotherapy regimen, the local breast recurrence rate was substantial.",0
Docetaxel vs doxorubicin in metastatic breast cancer resistant to alkylating chemotherapy.,"Single-agent docetaxel (Taxotere) has been shown to be highly active in metastatic breast cancer, with an overall response rate of 47%, median time to progression of 4 months, and survival of 10 months when administered as second-line therapy. These data compare favorably with those reported for doxorubicin (Adriamycin), which has been considered the most active single agent in this setting. This nonblinded, multicenter, randomized phase III study compared the median time to progression, response rate, quality of life, toxicity, and survival after treatment with docetaxel or doxorubicin in patients with metastatic breast cancer in whom previous alkylating chemotherapy failed. Patients were randomized to receive an intravenous infusion of either docetaxel, 100 mg/m2, for 1 hour once every 3 weeks or doxorubicin, 75 mg/m2, for 15 to 20 minutes once every 3 weeks. This preliminary analysis presents data on 200 of 326 patients recruited. It was performed after the completion of patient accrual. The median time to progression was greater in the docetaxel group than in the doxorubicin group (29 vs 21 weeks, respectively; P = not significant). Overall response rates were higher with docetaxel (47% vs 27%), and fewer patients in the docetaxel group had progressive disease as their best overall response (10% vs 22%). Both regimens caused the same incidence and severity of neutropenia, yet patients treated with doxorubicin had a higher incidence of infection and febrile neutropenia. In addition, doxorubicin produced a higher incidence of grade 3 to 4 thrombocytopenia. Cardiac toxicity led to discontinuation in 7 patients and death in 2 patients in the doxorubicin group; fluid retention led to discontinuation in 1 patient in the docetaxel group. Based on this preliminary analysis, docetaxel was more active and safer than doxorubicin in patients with metastatic breast cancer in whom previous alkylating chemotherapy failed.",1
Ovarian irradiation and prednisone following surgery and radiotherapy for carcinoma of the breast.,"Following mastectomy, patients aged 35 to 76 years with operable breast cancer underwent postoperative irradiation of the chest wall and regional lymph nodes. They were then assigned at random to receive no further therapy (NT), ovarian irradiation (R) 2000 rads in 5 days, or ovarian irradiation in the same dosage plus prednisone (R + P) 7.5 mg daily for up to five years. A total of 703 eligible patients received the randomly assigned treatment. The median follow up was 21 years with a range of 14 to 25 years. Overall, there was a delay in recurrence (p = 0.03) and survival was prolonged (p = 0.19) for patients who received R, but in neither case was the difference significant after adjusting for the multiplicity in our data. Overall, patients who received R + P experienced a significant delay in recurrence (p = 0.0003) and a significantly prolonged survival (p = 0.005), even after adjusting for multiple comparisons. In premenopausal patients who received R, the recurrence of breast cancer was delayed and survival prolonged, but not significantly. In premenopausal women aged 45 years or more, R + P therapy significantly prolonged survival (p = 0.0004), while the delay in recurrence although significant (p = 0.02) was only marginally so after allowance for multiple comparisons. No value was demonstrated for ovarian irradiation with or without prednisone therapy in postmenopausal patients. A new finding in this review was that contralateral breast cancer as the first failure was reduced by R + P compared to NT in the overall group.",1
"Potent corticosteroid cream (mometasone furoate) significantly reduces acute radiation dermatitis: results from a double-blind, randomized study.","PURPOSE: Radiation-induced dermatitis is a very common side effect of radiation therapy, and may necessitate interruption of the therapy. There is a substantial lack of evidence-based treatments for this condition. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of mometasone furoate cream (MMF) on radiation dermatitis in a prospective, double-blind, randomized study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study comprised 49 patients with node-negative breast cancer. They were operated on with sector resection and scheduled for postoperative radiotherapy using photons with identical radiation qualities and dosage to the breast parenchyma. The patients were randomized to receive either MMF or emollient cream. The cream was applied on the irradiated skin twice a week from the start of radiotherapy until the 12th fraction (24 Gy) and thereafter once daily until 3 weeks after completion of radiation. Both groups additionally received non-blinded emollient cream daily. The intensity of the acute radiation dermatitis was evaluated on a weekly basis regarding erythema and pigmentation, using a reflectance spectrophotometer together with visual scoring of the skin reactions. RESULTS: MMF in combination with emollient cream treatment significantly decreased acute radiation dermatitis (P=0.0033) compared with emollient cream alone. There was no significant difference in pigmentation between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Adding MMF, a potent topical corticosteroid, to an emollient cream is statistically significantly more effective than emollient cream alone in reducing acute radiation dermatitis.",0
Prognostic significance of three novel biologic factors in a clinical trial of adjuvant therapy for node-negative breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Five products of human breast carcinoma cells, including membrane-associated phospholipase A2 (M-PLA2), polymorphonuclear leukocyte elastase (PMN-E), tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA), and endothelin-1 (ET-1), have been implicated in the processes of tumor cell invasion and metastasis in human breast carcinoma. However, the prognostic significance of these factors has not been assessed previously in node-negative breast carcinoma, in which adjuvant treatment is dependent on risk stratification. METHODS: The five products of breast carcinoma cells were measured in 184 patients with node-negative breast carcinoma who were enrolled in the Kumamoto Adjuvant Chemo-Endocrine Therapy for Breast Cancer prospective randomized trial, and the predictive values of these factors for relapse-free and overall survival were evaluated. RESULTS: M-PLA2, PMN-E, and t-PA were found to be significant independent predictors of relapse-free and overall survival, whereas u-PA and ET-1 were not independently predictive. Further statistical analyses showed that the predictive powers of M-PLA2, PMN-E, and t-PA were additive. A combination of these three factors identified a group of patients (approximately 50% of those who manifested node-negative breast carcinoma) with a favorable prognosis, regardless of the administration of adjuvant therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified three biologic factors that are valuable predictors of survival in node-negative breast carcinoma. A combination of these biologic factors may allow identification of low-risk patients who could be spared adjuvant therapy.",0
The increase of the rate of hemopoietic recovery and clinical benefit of the erythropoietin (EPO) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) with peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) after intensive cyclic chemotherapy in high-risk breast cancer patients.,"The role of erythropoietin (EPO) plus granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) combination in hemopoietic recovery was studied in patients with high-risk breast carcinoma and compared to a control group of previously treated identical patients who were not given EPO plus G-CSF. Eleven consecutive patients admitted to this study had Stage III or IV breast cancer. They received 6 cycles of intensive chemotherapy (epirubicin 150 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 1300 mg/m2). The 1st cycle served for mobilization of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC). At its end leukaphereses collections of PBPC were performed to be used as hematologic support (PBPCT) in the 5 remaining cycles. The administration of EPO plus G-CSF was started when leukocyte (WBC) count in peripheral blood dropped below 1 x 10(9)/l and hemoglobin (Hb) level fell below 100 g/l. The treatment was stopped when leukocyte count rose to 5 x 10(9)/l and Hb to 130 g/l. EPO plus G-CSF combination after PBPCT produced significant effects in terms of hemopoietic recovery, clinical benefit and supportive care requirements when compared with 12 historic control patients: Periods of leukopenia were shorter which resulted in reduced risk of infectious complications. The grades of leukopenia in the study and control groups were as follows: grade 4 (36 vs. 18%), grade 3 (57 vs. 30%), grade 2 (7 vs. 13%) respectively. Significantly shorter was the time of PLT recovery < 50 x 10(9)/l (p < 0.001). The grades of thrombocytopenia were: grade 4 (29 vs. 11%), grade 3 (21 vs. 12%), grade 2 (25 vs. 36%) respectively. The number of necessary transfusions was significantly reduced as well as the length of hospital stay (p < 0.001). In conclusion, our results obtained in this study confirm that combination of EPO plus G-CSF not only increases the rate of hemopoietic recovery, reduces the number of necessary red blood cell and platelet transfusions but, at the same time, simplifies the clinical management and is more tolerable for the patients.",0
Randomised trial of paclitaxel versus doxorubicin as first-line chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer: quality of life evaluation using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the Rotterdam symptom checklist.,"The aim of the study was to compare the quality of life (QL) of patients treated with single-agent paclitaxel versus doxorubicin as first-line chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer. 331 patients with advanced breast cancer were randomised, with 294 eligible for analysis. Patients completed both the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire and the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist (RSCL) with six additional items, at baseline and after the third, fifth and seventh cycles of chemotherapy. A significant difference in progression-free survival in favour of doxorubicin caused a bias in the data with differences in expected completion rates of questionnaires beyond cycle three. Therefore, statistical comparisons were performed only for the first three cycles. Baseline compliance was 64% and 61% for the QLQ-C30 and RSCL questionnaires, respectively. Doxorubicin was associated with significantly more nausea/vomiting (P=0.001), loss of appetite (P=0.010) and a greater burden of disease and treatment (P=0.044), but with less bone pain (P=0.042) and rash (P=0.045) than paclitaxel. Both treatments were associated with improved emotional function and reduction in psychological distress at cycle 3. Longitudinal data suggested that doxorubicin was associated with less pain, specifically bone pain. Doxorubicin was more active but may have had more side-effects during the first three cycles. Long-term QL outcomes could not be assessed.",0
High local recurrence risk after breast-conserving therapy in node-negative premenopausal breast cancer patients is greatly reduced by one course of perioperative chemotherapy: A European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Breast Cancer Cooperative Group Study.,"PURPOSE: Patients with invasive breast cancer may develop a local recurrence (LR) after breast-conserving therapy (BCT). Younger age has been found to be an independent risk factor for LR. Within a group of premenopausal node-negative breast cancer patients, we studied risk factors for LR and the effect of perioperative chemotherapy (PeCT) on LR. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) conducted a randomized trial (EORTC 10854) to compare surgery followed by one course of PeCT (fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide) with surgery alone. From patients treated on this trial, we selected premenopausal patients with node-negative breast cancer who were treated with BCT to examine whether histologic characteristics and the expression of various proteins (estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, p53, Ki-67, bcl-2, CD31, c-erbB-2/neu) are risk factors for subsequent LR. Also, the effect of one course of PeCT on the LR risk (LRR) was studied. RESULTS: Using multivariate analysis, age younger than 43 years (relative risk [RR], 2.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.46 to 5.18; P =.002), multifocal growth (RR, 3.34; 95% CI, 1.27 to 8.77; P =.014), and elevated levels of p53 (RR, 2. 14; 95% CI, 1.13 to 4.05; P =.02) were associated with higher LRR. Also, PeCT was found to reduce LRR by more than 50% (RR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.86; P =.02). Patients younger than 43 years who received PeCT achieved similar LR rates as those of patients younger than 43 years who were treated with BCT alone. CONCLUSION: In premenopausal node-negative patients, age younger than 43 years is the most important risk factor for LR after BCT; this risk is greatly reduced by one course of PeCT. The main reason for administering systemic adjuvant treatment is to improve overall survival. The important reduction of LR after BCT is an additional reason for considering systemic treatment in young node-negative patients with breast cancer.",0
"Phase III trial of doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide (AC), docetaxel, and alternating AC and docetaxel as front-line chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer: Japan Clinical Oncology Group trial (JCOG9802).","BACKGROUND: This randomized, multicenter, phase III trial compared doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide (AC), single-agent docetaxel (D), and an alternating regimen of AC and docetaxel (AC-D) as first-line chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer (MBC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with MBC resistant to endocrine therapy were entered in a randomized study to receive either six cycles of AC (doxorubicin 40 mg/m2 plus cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2), D (60 mg/m2), or alternating treatment with AC-D (i.e. three cycles of AC and three cycles of D). Treatment was administered every 3 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 441 patients were entered in a randomized study. Response rates were 30% for AC, 41% for D, and 35% for AC-D. The median times to treatment failure (TTFs) were 6.4, 6.4, and 6.7 months (one-sided log-rank test, P = 0.13 for AC versus D, P = 0.14 for AC versus AC-D) and median overall survival (OS) was 22.6, 25.7, and 25.0 months (P = 0.09 for AC versus D, P = 0.13 for AC versus AC-D) in the AC, D, and AC-D, respectively. CONCLUSION: There was no difference in the TTF among the three arms. However, there was a trend toward a better response and better OS in the D than in the AC.",1
A preliminary assessment of factors associated with recurrent disease in a surgical adjuvant clinical trial for patients with breast cancer with special emphasis on the aggressiveness of therapy.,"Two hundred ninety-three patients were randomly assigned to three treatment regimens following mastectomy for operable but prognostically unfavorable breast cancer: L-PAM, CFP, or CFP with radiation therapy. For premenopausal patients an increased risk of recurrence was associated with the presence of unfavorable local signs, large number of lymph nodes involved, greater body weight, younger age, and L-PAM treatment. For the postmenopausal patients only three factors were associated with an increased risk of recurrent disease: large tumor size, large number of lymph nodes involved, and inner/central location of the primary lesion. Specifically, the treatment employed has shown no effect. Of particular importance is the fact that for neither group of patients does our experience presently demonstrate clear association of recurrent disease with the level of drug dose administered. Furthermore, evidence suggests that although patients who experience little or no myelosuppression have significantly worse disease-free intervals than patients who experience moderate or severe myelosuppression, here is no benefit for severe myelosuppression over moderate, myelosuppression.",0
Treatment of operable breast cancer in the elderly: a randomised clinical trial EORTC 10851 comparing tamoxifen alone with modified radical mastectomy.,"For treatment of early breast cancer in older women, little evidence is available from randomised trials. We conducted a randomised trial comparing modified radical mastectomy (MRM) with tamoxifen (TAM) as the sole initial therapy in 164 patients aged >/=70 years with operable breast cancer. 82 were treated by MRM and 82 with TAM. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method: multivariate analyses were performed using the Cox's proportional hazards model. Endpoints included survival, time to first relapse or progression, loco-regional progression, time to distant progression and progression-free survival. After a median follow-up of approximately 10 years, there was a significantly decreased time to progression in the TAM only group (logrank P<0.0001) and significantly shorter time to local progression within the TAM group (logrank P<0.0001). Overall survival of the two groups was similar. The results indicate that tamoxifen alone leads to an unacceptably high rate of local progression or relapse.",1
"Is chemotherapy necessary for premenopausal women with lower-risk node-positive, endocrine responsive breast cancer? 10-year update of International Breast Cancer Study Group Trial 11-93.","INTRODUCTION: International Breast Cancer Study Group (IBCSG) Trial 11-93 is the largest trial evaluating the role of the addition of chemotherapy to ovarian function suppression/ablation (OFS) and tamoxifen in premenopausal patients with endocrine-responsive early breast cancer.METHODS: IBCSG Trial 11-93 is a randomized trial comparing four cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy (AC: doxorubicin or epirubicin, plus cyclophosphamide) added to OFS and 5 years of tamoxifen versus OFS and tamoxifen without chemotherapy in premenopausal patients with node-positive, endocrine-responsive early breast cancer. There were 174 patients randomized from May 1993 to November 1998. The trial was closed before the target accrual was reached due to low accrual rate.RESULTS: Patients randomized tended to have lower risk node-positive disease and the median age was 45. After 10 years median follow up, there remains no difference between the two randomized treatment groups for disease-free (hazard ratio=1.02 (0.57-1.83); P=0.94) or overall survival (hazard ratio=0.97 (0.44-2.16); P=0.94).CONCLUSION: This trial, although small, offers no evidence that AC chemotherapy provides additional disease control for premenopausal patients with lower-risk node-positive endocrine-responsive breast cancer who receive adequate adjuvant endocrine therapy. A large trial is needed to determine whether chemotherapy adds benefit to endocrine therapy for this population.",1
"Adjuvant treatment of node-positive breast cancer with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, fluorouracil, and vincristine versus cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil: final report after a 16-year median follow-up duration.","PURPOSE: To determine the long-term impact on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy, when prospectively compared by random allocation with standard cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) in node-positive (N+) breast cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred forty-nine patients with N+ breast cancer, recruited from eight French cancer centers, were randomized to receive 12 monthly cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy, either CMF (n = 112) or doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and fluorouracil (AVCF) (n = 136). All had a negative metastatic work-up before inclusion, which was stratified by accrual center, tumor stage (International Union Against Cancer [UICC]), and menopausal status. RESULTS: No severe adverse effect related to grade 4 (World Health Organization [WHO]) toxicity was observed. There was no difference in second primary tumor incidence between the two arms. The treatment given was 88% of planned for AVCF and 75% for CMF in both premenopausal and menopausal patients. With a median follow-up time of 16 years (range, 13 to 17), the OS and DFS rates are significantly longer in the AVCF arm (56% v 41% [P = .01] for OS, and 53% v 36% [P = .006] for DFS). These differences are significant, irrespective of tumor stage (T1 to T2 v T3 to T4), and remain positive in patients with or without postoperative locoregional radiotherapy (55% of cohort). When analyzed according to menopausal status, the differences remain significant only for premenopausal patients. CONCLUSION: This set of mature controlled data confirms the added value of anthracycline-based combination adjuvant therapy for N+ breast cancer patients when compared with CMF, with both regimens given for 1 year.",1
"Long-term follow-up of acupuncture and hormone therapy on hot flushes in women with breast cancer: a prospective, randomized, controlled multicenter trial.","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of electro-acupuncture (EA) and hormone therapy (HT) on vasomotor symptoms in women with a history of breast cancer. METHODS: Forty-five women were randomized to EA (n = 27) for 12 weeks or HT (n = 18) for 24 months. The number of and distress caused by hot flushes were registered daily before, during and up to 24 months after start of treatment. RESULTS: In 19 women who completed 12 weeks of EA, the median number of hot flushes/24 h decreased from 9.6 (interquartile range (IQR) 6.6-9.9) at baseline to 4.3 (IQR 1.0-7.1) at 12 weeks of treatment (p < 0.001). At 12 months after start of treatment, 14 women with only the initial 12 weeks of EA had a median number of flushes/24 h of 4.9 (IQR 1.8-7.3), and at 24 months seven women with no other treatment than EA had 2.1 (IQR 1.6-2.8) flushes/24 h. Another five women had a decreased number of flushes after having additional EA. The 18 women with HT had a baseline median number of flushes/24 h of 6.6 (IQR 4.0-8.9), and 0.0 (IQR 0.0-1.6; p = 0.001) at 12 weeks. CONCLUSION: Electro-acupuncture is a possible treatment of vasomotor symptoms for women with breast cancer and should be further studied for this group of women.",0
"Tailored fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide compared with marrow-supported high-dose chemotherapy as adjuvant treatment for high-risk breast cancer: a randomised trial. Scandinavian Breast Group 9401 study.","BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy drug distribution varies greatly among individual patients. Therefore, we developed an individualised fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide (FEC) regimen to improve outcomes in patients with high-risk early breast cancer. We then did a randomised trial to compare this individually tailored FEC regimen with conventional adjuvant chemotherapy followed by consolidation with high-dose chemotherapy with stem-cell support. METHODS: 525 women younger than 60 years of age with high-risk primary breast cancer were randomised after surgery to receive nine cycles of tailored FEC to haematological equitoxicity with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support (n=251), or three cycles of FEC at standard doses followed by high-dose chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, and carboplatin (CTCb), and peripheral-blood stem-cell or bone-marrow support (n=274). Both groups received locoregional radiation therapy and tamoxifen for 5 years. The primary outcome measure was relapse-free survival, and analysis was by intention to treat. FINDINGS: At a median follow-up of 34.3 months, there were 81 breast-cancer relapses in the tailored FEC group versus 113 in the CTCb group (double triangular method p=0.04). 60 deaths occurred in the tailored FEC group and 82 in the CTCb group (log-rank p=0.12). Patients in the CTCb group experienced more grade 3 or 4 acute toxicity compared with the tailored FEC group (p<0.0001). Two treatment-related deaths (0.7%) occurred in the CTCb group. Six patients in the tailored FEC group developed acute myeloid leukaemia and three developed myelodysplastic syndrome. INTERPRETATION: Tailored FEC with G-CSF support resulted in a significantly improved relapse-free survival and fewer grade 3 and 4 toxicities compared with marrow-supported high-dose chemotherapy with CTCb as adjuvant therapy of women with high-risk primary breast cancer.",1
Age as a prognostic factor in recurrent breast cancer.,"The effect of age as a prognostic factor in recurrent breast cancer was studied in 1,168 patients treated on Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) protocols. Survival was significantly shorter in patients less than 35 years of age (P = .03). This was true even when other good prognostic factors were present. Eighteen prognostic factors were analyzed, and the effect on survival in each of six age groups was studied. Patients with better performance status, less than three sites of metastases, and without visceral or nodal metastases had a better survival time. A Cox proportional hazards model of survival showed that younger age groups, irrespective of menopausal status, had shorter survival times. The predicted median survival times after the first recurrence were 491 days for patients less than 35 years of age, 590 days for patients 36 to 45 years of age, and 700 days for those greater than 45 years of age.",0
Perioperative bromocriptine adjuvant treatment for operable breast cancer.,"Blood levels of prolactin are consistently raised in women who have undergone mastectomy for breast cancer, probably because of the stress of surgery. Since this increase in concentration of a known breast epithelial growth promoter might stimulate proliferation in micrometastatic cells shed at the time of surgery, a pilot study was conducted to try to abolish this effect. 38 patients with suspected operable breast cancer were given either bromocriptine (18) or placebo (20) tablets for 5 days preoperatively and thereafter for 3-10 days. Bromocriptine-treated patients showed significant reductions in prolactin levels and in S-phase fraction of tumour cells within the primary infiltrating carcinoma. There were no major side-effects. Perioperative bromocriptine may provide another approach to adjuvant therapy, possibly combined with endocrine or cytotoxic treatment for patients with axillary nodal metastases.",0
Clodronate for osteolytic metastases due to breast cancer.,"Breast-cancer patients with multiple osteolytic bone metastases were treated with clodronate (Cl2MDP) 1.6 g/day (17 patients) or placebo (17 patients) for 12 months. Bone pain, extension of bone metastases and formation of new osteolytic foci were reduced by Cl2MDP, and development of severe hypercalcaemia was prevented. After withdrawal of treatment, the patients were followed up for at least 12 months. New bone metastases developed in both groups. There were, however, less fractures and less hypercalcaemia in the Cl2MDP than in the placebo group. The survival rate was higher in the Cl2MDP group than in the placebo group. No side-effects were observed in the Cl2MDP group.",0
Impact of a mixed strength and endurance exercise intervention on insulin levels in breast cancer survivors.,"PURPOSE: Accumulating data suggest that exercise may affect breast cancer risk and outcomes. Studies have demonstrated that high levels of insulin, often seen in sedentary individuals, are associated with increased risk of breast cancer recurrence and death. We sought to analyze whether exercise lowered insulin concentrations in breast cancer survivors. METHODS: One hundred one sedentary, overweight breast cancer survivors were randomly assigned either to a 16-week cardiovascular and strength training exercise intervention or to a usual care control group. Fasting insulin and glucose levels, weight, body composition, and circumference at the waist and hip were collected at baseline and 16 weeks. RESULTS: Baseline and 16-week measurements were available for 82 patients. Fasting insulin concentrations decreased by an average of 2.86 microU/mL in the exercise group (P = .03), with no significant change in the control group (decrease of 0.27 microU/mL, P = .65). The change in insulin levels in the exercise group seemed greater than the change in controls, but the comparison did not reach statistical significance (P = .07). There was a trend toward improvement in insulin resistance in the exercise group (P = .09) but no change in fasting glucose levels. The exercise group also experienced a significant decrease in hip measurements, with no change in weight or body composition. CONCLUSION: Participation in an exercise intervention was associated with a significant decrease in insulin levels and hip circumference in breast cancer survivors. The relationship between physical activity and breast cancer prognosis may be mediated, in part, through changes in insulin levels and/or changes in body fat or fat deposition.",0

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for operable breast carcinoma larger than 3 cm: a unicentre randomized trial with a 124-month median follow-up. Institut Bergonié Bordeaux Groupe Sein (IBBGS).,"BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy improves overall survival and renders possible breast-conserving treatment in locally advanced breast cancer. It was necessary for this method to be evaluated in operable breast tumors too large to be treated immediately by conserving surgery. Initial results of this randomized trial were published in Annals of Oncology (1991). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women with T2 > 3 cm or T3 N0-1 M0 breast tumors were treated by either initial mastectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, or neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by adjusted locoregional treatment. Chemotherapy was the same in the two arms. The prognostic and predictive factors of response to chemotherapy were analyzed. RESULTS: Conserving treatments were performed in 63% at the end of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and this rate had decreased to 45% at the median follow-up of 124 months. Survivals are identical in the two treatment groups. Initial clinical tumor size < 40 mm, IHC-ER < 10% and Mib1 > 40% are predictive of tumor response to chemotherapy by uni- and multivariate analyses. For outcome prediction, c-erb-B2 > 0% is the independent prognostic factor for overall and metastasis-free survivals. CONCLUSION: Breast-conserving therapy can be performed in more than half of all cases without alteration of survival, despite a non-negligible rate of local recurrences.",0
Cost-effectiveness of adjuvant docetaxel for node-positive breast cancer patients: results of the PACS 01 economic study.,"BACKGROUND: Using data from the PACS 01 randomized trial, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of anthracyclines plus docetaxel (Taxotere; FEC-D) versus anthracyclines alone (FEC100) in patients with node-positive breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Costs and outcomes were assessed in 1996 patients and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated, using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as outcome. To deal with uncertainty due to sampling fluctuations, confidence regions around the ICERs were calculated and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were drawn up. Sensitivity analyses were also carried out to assess the robustness of conclusions. RESULTS: The mean cost of treatment was 33% higher with strategy FEC-D, but this difference decreased to 18% at a 5-year horizon. The ICER of FEC-D versus FEC100 was estimated to be 9665euro per QALY gained (95% confidence interval euro2372-euro55 515). The estimated probability that FEC-D was cost-effective reached >96% for a threshold of euro50 000 per QALY gained. If the price of taxane decreased slightly, the ICER would reach some very reasonable levels and this strategy would therefore be much more cost-effective. CONCLUSION: The sequential use of FEC100 followed by docetaxel appears to be a cost-effective alternative, even when uncertainty is taken into account.",0
A prospective randomized trial of buffy coat versus CD34-selected autologous bone marrow support in high-risk breast cancer patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy.,"High-dose chemotherapy with hematopoietic progenitor cell support is administered increasingly to selected categories of patients with high-risk malignancies. Bone marrow and/or peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) are commonly cryopreserved with the cryoprotectant dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which can cause a variety of systemic side effects when the graft is thawed and infused. The progenitor cells thought to be responsible for hematopoietic recovery express the CD34 antigen and constitute 1% to 3% of the marrow cells and 0.5% of the PBPC fraction. Transplantation of a CD34(+) graft would markedly reduce the volume and thus the amount of DMSO required, thereby decreasing the infusion-related toxicities. In this study, 89 high-risk breast cancer patients received high-dose therapy and were randomized to receive an autologous CD34(+) marrow graft (Arm A) versus a standard buffy coat fraction (Arm B). After marrow infusion, significant increases in diastolic and systolic blood pressure, as well as significant decreases in heart rate, were documented in Arm B compared to Arm A patients (P < .001). None of the patients in Arm A experienced any clinically serious adverse events associated with the marrow infusion compared to 6% of the Arm B patients. The median time to neutrophil engraftment was 13 days for Arm A and 11 days for Arm B patients (P = .218). The median time to platelet engraftment was 27 days for Arm A and 20 days for Arm B patients (0.051). There were no other significant differences between the two arms of the study with respect to thrombocytopenia-related complications or immune function reconstitution. Additionally, patients on Arm A who received >/=1.2 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg had no delay in platelet recovery (22 days), compared to patients on Arm B, who also received greater than 1.2 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg (20 days) (P = .604). In conclusion, this prospective randomized study demonstrates that breast cancer patients who receive high-dose therapy with autologous CD34(+) marrow support have reduced marrow infusion-related toxicity, comparable time to neutrophil engraftment and immune function recovery posttransplant, and for those who receive <1.2 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg, comparable time to platelet engraftment compared to women who receive buffy coat fractions of marrow.",0
"Fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide followed by tamoxifen as adjuvant treatment for patients with stage IV breast cancer with no evidence of disease.","We conducted a single-institution study to determine whether local therapy plus six cycles of chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) followed by 5 years of tamoxifen is superior to local treatment alone in terms of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with stage IV breast cancer with no evidence of disease (stage IV-NED breast cancer). Patients with breast cancer were eligible if they had histologic proof of a locoregional or distant recurrence that had been curatively resected, irradiated, or both and had no other evidence of disease. Patients who had received prior anthracycline therapy were not eligible. All patients received six cycles of intravenous FAC, with cycles repeated every 3 weeks. After completion of chemotherapy, patients whose tumors had not previously demonstrated resistance to tamoxifen and had positive or unknown estrogen receptor status received tamoxifen 20 mg by mouth daily for 5 years. Patients in this study were compared with a historical control population (patients with stage IV-NED breast cancer who never received systemic therapy) as well as with the patients in two previously reported trials of chemotherapy for stage IV-NED disease. Forty-seven patients were registered, but only 45 were evaluable. There was a highly statistically significant difference ( p < 0.001) in OS and DFS among the four groups, with patients in our most recent study having the best OS and DFS at 3 years compared with the control group (84% vs. 55% and 66% vs. 11%, respectively). When patients in all four groups were analyzed together in search of prognostic factors, we found that patients whose primary tumors had negative axillary lymph nodes had a statistically significant improvement in OS and DFS ( p < 0.01) compared with patients with positive axillary lymph nodes. No survival differences were found between patients with positive and those with negative hormone receptor status. This study demonstrates a benefit in terms of OS and DFS for patients with stage IV-NED breast cancer who receive doxorubicin-based adjuvant chemotherapy. The benefit was greater on patients with node-negative primary tumors. In patients with stage IV-NED disease, doxorubicin-based chemotherapy should be considered standard treatment after adequate local control is achieved.",1
Risk factors for breast cancer in older women: the relative contribution of bone mineral density and other established risk factors.,"AIM: To determine the contribution of bone mineral density (BMD) to breast cancer risk relative to other established breast cancer risk factors in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. METHODS: Data for this analysis comprised those collected from women randomized to placebo in the MORE and CORE trials (N = 2,576). Risk factors measured at baseline included age, family history of breast cancer, estradiol level, body mass index, prior hormone therapy, BMD and vertebral fracture status. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Over a total of 13,698 woman-years of follow-up, 65 incident breast cancers occurred. In univariate analyses, older age and family history of breast cancer were the strongest predictors of breast cancer risk, associated with a 2.4- and 2.6-fold increase in breast cancer incidence. A higher estradiol level was associated with a 1.9-fold increase in breast cancer incidence. The association between femoral neck BMD and breast cancer incidence was only significant after adjustment for age (P = 0.03). The final multivariable model included age, family history, estradiol, BMD, and the BMD-estradiol interaction since the effect of BMD on breast cancer varied by estradiol level (interaction P-value, 0.04); in those with a lower estradiol level, a higher BMD was associated with a 2.6-fold increased in breast cancer. CONCLUSION: Overall, BMD is a relatively weak predictor of breast cancer risk in these postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, after taking into consideration age, family history and endogenous estradiol level.",0
"A single-center, prospective and randomized controlled study: Can the prophylactic use of lamivudine prevent hepatitis B virus reactivation in hepatitis B s-antigen seropositive breast cancer patients during chemotherapy?","Over the past four decades, chemotherapy has played an important role in prolonging survival in breast cancer patients. However, it may also result in undesirable side effects such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation seen in this study. With the increasing use of chemotherapy paralleling the rise in breast cancer incidence, the occurrence of HBV reactivation is likely to further increase. Several strategies use lamivudine to deal with this problem. Initially, lamivudine had been used to treat patients who developed alanine transaminase elevation attributable to HBV reactivation during chemotherapy. However, using this strategy, fatal reactivation has also been reported. Later studies have suggested that prophylactic lamivudine significantly reduces HBV reactivation and its associated morbidity. However, these studies were based mainly on patients with lymphoma, whereas studies on breast cancer patients were few. Moreover, these studies were retrospective. Recently, a prospective study has recommended that deferred preemptive lamivudine could be a comparable alternative to the prophylactic strategy. However, it was not a randomized controlled study. In this study, it was examined the efficacy of the prophylactic strategy in hepatitis B s-antigen seropositive breast cancer patients during chemotherapy using a prospective, randomized controlled study. Two groups were studied. One group consisted of 21 patients who were treated with prophylactic lamivudine, the other group consisted of 21 patients who were not treated with prophylactic lamivudine. The results showed that the prophylactic lamivudine strategy significantly decreased the incidence of HBV reactivation (0 vs. 28.6%, P = 0.021). It was conclude that the prophylactic lamivudine strategy significantly reduces the incidence of HBV reactivation for hepatitis B s-antigen seropositive breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy.",0
Prevalence of endometrial proliferation in pipelle biopsies in tamoxifen-treated postmenopausal women with breast cancer in Kuwait.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of pathologic changes in the endometrium of tamoxifen-treated asymptomatic postmenopausal patients with breast cancer. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifty postmenopausal asymptomatic breast cancer patients with positive estrogen receptor status were treated with 20 mg of tamoxifen daily for a period of 5-60 months. The control group consisted of 30 asymptomatic postmenopausal breast cancer patients who were negative for estrogen receptor and therefore did not receive tamoxifen. Endometrial biopsies were performed using Pipelle endometrial suction curette at least 5 months after the study began. The endometrium was classified as atrophic (negative finding) and proliferative or hyperplastic (positive findings). The study and control groups were compared for demographic characteristics, risk factors for endometrial cancer, histological findings and the duration of tamoxifen treatment. RESULTS: A significantly greater prevalence of endometrial abnormalities existed among the tamoxifen-treated than control patients (76 vs. 33%, p < 0.001). The abnormal endometrial changes were further demarcated in both groups into proliferative (54 vs. 26.7%, p = 0.02) and hyperplastic (22 vs. 6.6%, p = NS). In the study group, 63.6% of hyperplastic endometrium was simple hyperplasia and 36.4% was complex/no atypia hyperplasia, while in the control group all the cases were simple hyperplasia. No endometrial cancer was detected in either group. In addition, there was a positive association between the duration of tamoxifen exposure (<1 year vs. >/=1 year) and the endometrial abnormalities (46.6 vs. 88.6%, p = 0.003; proliferative 57.1 vs. 74.1%, p = 0.015; hyperplastic 42.8 vs. 25.8%, p = NS). CONCLUSION: The adjuvant use of tamoxifen is associated with significant time-dependent abnormal endometrial changes among patients with cancer of the breast.",0
Gemcitabine plus docetaxel: a new treatment option for anthracycline pretreated metastatic breast cancer patients?,"Antimetabolite-taxane combinations have been shown to be effective chemotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). A multicentre phase III trial comparing gemcitabine-docetaxel with capecitabine-docetaxel in women with anthracycline pretreated MBC was carried out in several European countries. Its results were presented recently [1]. One-hundred and fifty-three patients were randomly assigned to receive docetaxel (75 mg/m2, day 1) plus gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2, days 1, 8) and 152 received docteaxel plus capecitabine (1250 mg/m2, bid days 1-14) every 3 weeks until disease progression. No difference in efficacy of the two treatment regimens was observed in terms of progression-free survival (35 weeks in both treatment arms), overall response rate (32% vs. 32%), time to treatment failure (19 vs. 18 weeks, respectively), or response duration (36 vs. 42 weeks). Drug-related toxicity, particularly hand-foot syndrome, mucositis and diarrhoea, was more frequent with capecitabine-docetaxel and there was a higher incidence of drug-related treatment withdrawals with this combination. Gemcitabine-docetaxel appeared to have a more favourable risk-benefit profile than capecitabine-docetaxel, and is an important new treatment option for women with anthracycline-pretreated MBC.",0
Tamoxifen improves endothelial function and reduces carotid intima-media thickness in postmenopausal women.,"BACKGROUND: Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen-receptor modulator shown to improve several cardiovascular risk factors in postmenopausal women with breast cancer. In animal studies tamoxifen inhibits the progression of atherosclerosis. Although the presence of a history with tamoxifen treatment is related to a lower intima-media thickness (IMT) of the common carotid artery, data from controlled follow-up studies are lacking to support this observation. METHODS: We examined 14 postmenopausal women with early stage breast cancer with indication for tamoxifen treatment (20 mg/d) and 13 healthy postmenopausal women. Flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery, combined carotid IMT, and aortic pulse wave were measured before and 6 months after treatment in the tamoxifen group and at the same times in the control group. RESULTS: FMD and IMT were significantly increased and decreased, respectively, in the treatment group compared to the control group (FMD: +2.2% +/- 0.9% vs +0.085% +/- 1%, P =.012; IMT: -0.088 +/- 0.03 mm vs +0.04 +/- 0.03 mm, P =.018, mean +/- standard error of the mean, treatment vs control group). These differences remained significant even when adjusted for age, duration of menopause, and cardiovascular risk factors. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was also significantly reduced after tamoxifen treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Tamoxifen treatment slows the progression of atherosclerosis in postmenopausal women with breast cancer as assessed by changes in carotid IMT. An improvement in endothelial function and blood lipid profile may be the reason for this beneficial effect.",0
HER2 overexpression and doxorubicin in adjuvant chemotherapy for resectable breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression was found to predict a good response in breast carcinoma patients treated with doxorubicin (Adriamycin [ADM]). Evidence from our recent study indicates that node-positive patients respond to cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) regardless of HER2 status. We address the issue of whether therapy regimens including CMF and ADM versus CMF alone have the same therapeutic effect in patients with HER2+ and HER2- tumors in terms of relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). METHODS: Archival specimens of the primary tumors from 506 patients in a prospective clinical trial were stained with the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody CB11. Originally, patients were randomly allocated to receive either 12 courses of intravenous CMF or eight courses of the same regimen followed by four cycles of ADM. RFS and OS were analyzed by a Cox model taking into account treatment, HER2 status, and the interaction between treatment and HER2 status, adjusting for the effect of other known clinical and biopathologic factors. RESULTS: Analysis of survival rates indicates a possible differential effect of treatment in the patients grouped according to HER2 status. Improved RFS and OS were observed in the HER2+ subgroup after treatment with CMF plus ADM versus CMF alone. With a median follow-up of 15 years, the hazard ratio (HR) for RFS was 0.83 in HER2+ tumors and 1.22 in HER2- tumors. The effect of treatment was more evident on OS in HER2+ patients (HR = 0.61; CI, 0.32 to 1.16) than in HER2- patients (HR = 1.26). CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that adding ADM to CMF might be beneficial for patients with HER2+ tumors.",0

"A randomized controlled comparative study of oral medroxyprogesterone acetate 1,200 and 600 mg in patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancer.","A randomized controlled comparative study of oral medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 1,200 mg (arm I) and 600 mg (arm II) was conducted in 80 patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancer. There were no significant differences between arm I and arm II in terms of response rate, duration of response and survival, or in terms of incidence and severity of adverse reactions. The lowest serum MPA concentration in responders tended to be higher than that in nonresponders. In the cohort of this study, the lowest concentration in partial response was 17.4 ng/ml, suggesting that this level may be the required minimum serum concentration.",1
'Arimidex' (anastrozole) versus tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer--efficacy overview.,"ATAC, a randomized, double-blind trial, compared tamoxifen (20 mg) with anastrozole ('Arimidex') (1 mg) alone, and the combination of anastrozole plus tamoxifen (combination), as adjuvant endocrine treatment for postmenopausal patients with early breast cancer. Patients with operable invasive breast cancer following completion of primary therapy, who were candidates to receive adjuvant endocrine therapy, were eligible for this study. Primary endpoints were disease-free survival (DFS) and tolerability. Other endpoints included time to recurrence (TTR: censoring non-breast cancer deaths before recurrence) and the incidence of contralateral breast cancer. A total of 9366 patients were included in this study (N=3125, 3116 and 3125 for anastrozole, tamoxifen and the combination, respectively). Median duration of therapy was 30.7 months and median follow-up was 33.3 months. The total numbers of events were 317, 379 and 383 for anastrozole, tamoxifen and the combination, respectively. DFS was significantly improved in the overall population for anastrozole versus tamoxifen (hazard ratio (HR)=0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.71-0.96), P=0.013). Anastrozole showed improved TTR compared with tamoxifen (HR=0.79, CI (0.67-0.94), P=0.008), which improved even further in the ER+ and/or PR+ subgroup (HR=0.73, CI (0.59-0.90), P=0.003). The incidences of hot flushes, thromboembolic events, ischaemic cerebrovascular events, vaginal bleeding/discharge and endometrial cancer were significantly reduced with anastrozole compared with tamoxifen (P<0.03 for all). Musculoskeletal disorders and fractures were significantly reduced in patients receiving tamoxifen compared with those on anastrozole (P<0.03 for both). No increase in hip fractures was seen for anastrozole versus tamoxifen (11 versus 13, respectively). Combination treatment was equivalent to tamoxifen in terms of both efficacy and tolerability. Anastrozole showed superior efficacy to tamoxifen for DFS, TTR and contralateral breast cancer. Early findings show anastrozole to be an effective and well-tolerated endocrine option for the treatment of postmenopausal patients with early breast cancer. For the first time a choice now exists for adjuvant endocrine treatment for postmenopausal women with hormone responsive tumours. Longer follow-up will further define the benefit/risk of anastrozole adjuvant therapy.",1
Adverse prognostic value of peritumoral vascular invasion: is it abrogated by adequate endocrine adjuvant therapy? Results from two International Breast Cancer Study Group randomized trials of chemoendocrine adjuvant therapy for early breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Peritumoral vascular invasion (PVI) may assist in assigning optimal adjuvant systemic therapy for women with early breast cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients participated in two International Breast Cancer Study Group randomized trials testing chemoendocrine adjuvant therapies in premenopausal (trial VIII) or postmenopausal (trial IX) node-negative breast cancer. PVI was assessed by institutional pathologists and/or central review on hematoxylin-eosin-stained slides in 99% of patients (analysis cohort 2754 patients, median follow-up >9 years).RESULTS: PVI, present in 23% of the tumors, was associated with higher grade tumors and larger tumor size (trial IX only). Presence of PVI increased locoregional and distant recurrence and was significantly associated with poorer disease-free survival. The adverse prognostic impact of PVI in trial VIII was limited to premenopausal patients with endocrine-responsive tumors randomized to therapies not containing goserelin, and conversely the beneficial effect of goserelin was limited to patients whose tumors showed PVI. In trial IX, all patients received tamoxifen: the adverse prognostic impact of PVI was limited to patients with receptor-negative tumors regardless of chemotherapy.CONCLUSION: Adequate endocrine adjuvant therapy appears to abrogate the adverse impact of PVI in node-negative disease, while PVI may identify patients who will benefit particularly from adjuvant therapy.",0
High dose medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) treatment in metastatic carcinoma of the breast: a dose-response evaluation.,"The results of controlled clinical trial that used high doses of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer are reported. Two treatment reigmens were used: regimen A, 500 mg daily with a total dose of 30 g; regimen B, 1,000 mg daily with a total dose of 60 g. The overall response rates were similar, with no statistically significant difference between the two treated groups. Regimen A (lower dosage group) reached a remission rate of 44%, whereas regimen B (higher dosage group) had a remission rate of 41%. The mean duration of response was 8 months with regimen A and 9 months with regimen B. The advantages of the lower dosage regimen as opposed to the higher dosage regimen of MPA in the treatment of advanced breast cancer are discussed.",1
Rapid growth rate in breast cancer: a confounding variable in adjuvant-chemotherapy trials.,"In randomised trials of adjuvant chemotherapy for node-positive breast cancer, significant benefits has been seen in premenopausal but not postmenopausal patients. A possible explanation for this distinction is that premenopausal groups contain a greater proportion of patients with rapidly growing tumours that respond well to chemotherapy. The purpose of this study was to assess the plausibility of this explanation, using a clinical index to estimate rate of growth. From a cohort of women with primary breast cancer, none of whom had received adjuvant chemotherapy, an adjuvant-treated population was simulated by means of a study of the 164 patients who would have been eligible for entry into an adjuvant trial. The prognosis for each patient was categorised according to premenopausal or postmenopausal status, nodal status (1-3 or greater than or equal to 4), and growth rate of the cancer (non-rapid or rapid). Patients with rapid growth rates comprised a greater proportion of the premenopausal group (32%) than of the postmenopausal group (20%). On the assumption that adjuvant chemotherapy would preferentially benefit the rapid-growth stratum, the potential impact of the disproportionate distribution of the rapid-growth-rate stratum on the results of adjuvant trials was calculated. The results showed that a disparity in distribution of the rapid-growth-rate stratum could account for the apparently greater benefit in premenopausal patients.",0
Ovarian overstimulation and cystic formation in premenopausal tamoxifen exposure: comparison between tamoxifen-treated and nontreated breast cancer patients.,"AIM: Tamoxifen is the antihormonal treatment of choice for premenopausal breast cancer patients with advanced breast disease. Its premenopausal administration has been shown to induce supraphysiological 17beta-estradiol serum levels and to be associated with the presence of persistent, bilateral functional ovarian cysts. However, these abnormalities have not yet been compared to controls. In this study we evaluated the possibility that the above hormonal and/or ovarian abnormalities are more frequent among premenopausal breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen than among similar nontreated patients, and thus they may be attributed to tamoxifen effect. METHODS: We evaluated serum hormone levels of 17beta-estradiol, follicular-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and progesterone, the presence of ovarian cysts, and various demographic and clinical characteristics in 20 premenopausal breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen (study group) and compared them to those observed in 12 similar nontreated patients (control group). RESULTS: Ovarian cysts were found in 80% of the study patients and only in 8.3% of the control patients (P = 0.001). The incidence of oligomenorrhea was nearly significantly higher in the study than in the control group (50 and 16.7%, respectively; P = 0.0651). Various serum hormone levels tested were not found to be significantly different between the two groups, except for 17beta-estradiol serum levels as detected on days 14 and 21 of the menstrual cycle, which were significantly higher among the study than in the control patients. (Day 14 serum estradiol: 757.7 +/- 372.0 pg/mL versus 206.5 +/- 275.0 pg/mL, P = 0.0012. Day 21 serum estradiol: 300.0 +/- 134.5 pg/mL versus 96.5 +/- 71.5 pg/mL, P = 0.0008.) CONCLUSIONS: Tamoxifen treatment increases the incidence of ovarian cysts and the significantly higher 17beta-estradiol serum levels in premenopausal breast cancer patients.",0
"Prospective randomized trial of 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) versus paclitaxel and FAC (TFAC) in patients with operable breast cancer: impact of taxane chemotherapy on locoregional control.","A previous randomized trial (CALGB 9344/Intergroup 0148) compared four cycles of adjuvant doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC) to four cycles of AC plus four cycles of paclitaxel (AC + T) and demonstrated that the addition of paclitaxel improved locoregional control (LRC) in patients with node-positive breast cancer. However, it could not be determined whether it was the paclitaxel or the increased duration of chemotherapy that led to this improvement. The present study aimed to analyze whether the addition of paclitaxel to a doxorubicin-based regimen improves LRC in a cohort of patients who all received eight total cycles of chemotherapy. Five hundred eleven women with operable breast cancer were randomized on a single-institution prospective trial to receive 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide (FAC) × 8 cycles (n = 252) or FAC × 4 cycles plus paclitaxel × 4 cycles (TFAC) (n = 259). Rates of LRC and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. Median follow-up was 124 months (range 5-167 months). The 10-year LRC rate was 92.6 versus 93.1% in the FAC versus TFAC arms, respectively (P = 0.26). The LRC between treatment arms did not differ when analyzed by locoregional treatment group: breast conservation therapy (BCT), mastectomy alone (M), and mastectomy + radiation (M + RT). The 10-year LRC rates were 95.1% (FAC) versus 91.2% (TFAC) after BCT (P = 0.98), 89.5% (FAC) versus 93.4% (TFAC) after M (P = 0.24), and 94.7% (FAC) versus 96.5% (TFAC) after M + RT (P = 0.59). Additionally, there was no difference in OS between the treatment arms, with 10-year OS rates of 78.4% (FAC) versus 81.7% (TFAC) (P = 0.93). The addition of paclitaxel to a doxorubicin-based regimen had no impact on LRC, regardless of the type of local therapy received. Historically inferior LRC with AC chemotherapy alone versus AC + T may have been due to an inadequate duration of systemic therapy and not due to the absence of paclitaxel.",1

Randomized clinical trial comparing mitoxantrone with doxorubicin in previously treated patients with metastatic breast cancer.,"Three hundred twenty-five women with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast who had failed one prior chemotherapeutic regimen for advanced disease were randomized to receive 14 mg/m2 of mitoxantrone or 75 mg/m2 of doxorubicin intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks. Enrollment was closed on October 31, 1984, after 165 patients were randomized to mitoxantrone and 160 patients to doxorubicin. Patients randomized to the two treatment groups were compared for response rate, duration of response, time to progression or death, time to treatment failure (TTF), and survival. The response rate to mitoxantrone was 20.6%, to doxorubicin 29.3% (P = .07). The median response duration was 151 days for the mitoxantrone group and 126 days for the doxorubicin group (P = .16). The median TTF was 70 days in the mitoxantrone group and 104 days in the doxorubicin group (P = .36). The median survival of patients initially randomized to receive mitoxantrone was 273 days; for doxorubicin 268 days (P = .40). There were three responses among 77 patients crossed over to mitoxantrone after initial treatment with doxorubicin. The major dose-limiting toxicity for both drugs was leukopenia. There was significantly less severe and less frequent toxicity with mitoxantrone administration. Severe nausea and vomiting occurred in 9.5% of mitoxantrone patients and 25.3% of doxorubicin patients (P less than .001). The incidence of severe stomatitis and mucositis was 0.6% in the mitoxantrone group and 8.4% in the doxorubicin group (P = .001). Severe alopecia occurred in 5.1% of mitoxantrone patients and 61.0% of doxorubicin patients (P less than .001). A life-table comparison of the cumulative dose to the development of a cardiac event showed that mitoxantrone had significantly less cardiotoxicity than doxorubicin (P = .0005). This study demonstrates that mitoxantrone is active as a single agent in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Compared with doxorubicin it appears to be marginally less active and significantly less toxic. We conclude that mitoxantrone can be used alone or with other standard drugs to palliate the symptoms of metastatic breast cancer, especially in settings where drug toxicity is an important consideration.",1
Prediction of risk of distant recurrence using the 21-gene recurrence score in node-negative and node-positive postmenopausal patients with breast cancer treated with anastrozole or tamoxifen: a TransATAC study.,"PURPOSE To determine whether the Recurrence Score (RS) provided independent information on risk of distant recurrence (DR) in the tamoxifen and anastrozole arms of the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination (ATAC) Trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS RNA was extracted from 1,372 tumor blocks from postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive primary breast cancer in the monotherapy arms of ATAC. Twenty-one genes were assessed by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and the RS was calculated. Cox proportional hazards models assessed the value of adding RS to a model with clinical variables (age, tumor size, grade, and treatment) in node-negative (N0) and node-positive (N+) women. RESULTS Reportable scores were available from 1,231 evaluable patients (N0, n = 872; N+, n = 306; and node status unknown, n = 53); 72, 74, and six DRs occurred in N0, N+, and node status unknown patients, respectively. For both N0 and N+ patients, RS was significantly associated with time to DR in multivariate analyses (P < .001 for N0 and P = .002 for N+). RS also showed significant prognostic value beyond that provided by Adjuvant! Online (P < .001). Nine-year DR rates in low (RS < 18), intermediate (RS = 18 to 30), and high RS (RS > or = 31) groups were 4%, 12%, and 25%, respectively, in N0 patients and 17%, 28%, and 49%, respectively, in N+ patients. The prognostic value of RS was similar in anastrozole- and tamoxifen-treated patients. CONCLUSION This study confirmed the performance of RS in postmenopausal HR+ patients treated with tamoxifen in a large contemporary population and demonstrated that RS is an independent predictor of DR in N0 and N+ hormone receptor-positive patients treated with anastrozole, adding value to estimates with standard clinicopathologic features.",0
A prospective study of hemoglobin A1c concentrations and risk of breast cancer in women.,"Impaired glucose metabolism and hyperinsulinemia have been hypothesized to increase breast cancer risk. However, findings from observational studies relating blood concentrations of hyperinsulinemia markers to breast cancer risk have been inconsistent. We prospectively evaluated whether hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) concentrations predict breast cancer risk in a large female cohort. We included 27,110 female participants of the Women's Health Study who were, at baseline, free of cancer and had usable blood specimens as well as sufficient information on potential risk factors for breast cancer. Relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated from Cox proportional hazards regression models. All Ps were two sided. During an average of 10 years of follow-up, 790 incident cases of invasive breast cancer were confirmed. Higher baseline HbA1c levels were not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. The multivariate RR for the highest relative to the lowest quintile of HbA1c levels was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.69-1.10; P(trend) = 0.22). Higher HbA1c levels were also not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer according to alternative clinical cutoff points for HbA1c or in the analyses stratified by body mass index or according to certain tumor characteristics. However, a weakly inverse association was noted among postmenopausal women, especially among those who had never used hormone therapy. There was also a weakly inverse association between HbA1c levels and estrogen receptor-negative breast tumors. These data suggest that higher HbA1c concentrations do not seem to increase risk of breast cancer among apparently healthy women.",0
High-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate plus mitomycin-C or vindesine in the treatment of advanced breast cancer.,Forty women with metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive either mitomycin-C (MMC) (21 patients) or vindesine (19 patients) with high dose medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). Response rates were not significantly different (33% for MPA and MMC and 28% for MPA and vindesine); the duration of response was better for patients receiving the MMC combination (median of 10.5 months versus 6 months for those on the vindesine combination).,1
Mobilization of peripheral blood progenitor cells in patients with breast cancer: a prospective randomized trial comparing rhG-CSF with the combination of rhG-CSF plus rhEpo after VIP-E chemotherapy.,"Peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) can be mobilized by chemotherapy, cytokines, or the combination of both. Recently, data from two non-randomized studies were published, showing an advantage for a combination of rhG-CSF plus rhEpo compared to rhG-CSF alone in mobilization of PBPC. To address this question we initiated a prospective, randomized trial in patients with breast cancer. Thirty (28 female, two male) of 32 randomized patients were evaluable. After primary surgery, therapy consisted of two cycles of VIP-E chemotherapy followed by high-dose (HD) chemotherapy with VIC. Mobilization and harvest of PBPC followed cycle 2. Group A received 5 microg rhG-CSF/kg body weight (bw) plus 150 IU rhEpo/kg bw. Group B was treated with 5 microg rhG-CSF/kg bw from dl until end of harvest. In the peripheral blood CD34+ cells as well as colony-forming units (CFU) started to rise on d8 with a peak on d10, followed by a decrease. No significant differences were observed between the groups. Furthermore, there was no significant difference with regard to MNC, CD34+ cells BFU-E and CFU-GM in apheresis products. Transplantation of > 1 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg bw after HD chemotherapy resulted in normal hematological recovery of all patients. No differences were observed in time to neutrophil or platelet recovery and need for blood product support. In this study addition of rhEpo to our standard mobilization chemotherapy did not result in improved mobilization of PBPC or in clinical benefits after HD chemotherapy.",0
"A multicentre, randomised phase II study of weekly or 3-weekly docetaxel in patients with metastatic breast cancer.","BACKGROUND: A phase II randomised trial was conducted to evaluate the tolerability and activity of weekly or 3-weekly docetaxel in patients with metastatic breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-three patients with histologically proven metastatic breast cancer were randomised to receive either docetaxel 40 mg/m2 weekly for 6 consecutive weeks followed by 2 weeks without treatment (n = 41), or docetaxel 100 mg/m2 on day 1 every 3 weeks (n = 42). RESULTS: The incidence of all grade 3-4 adverse events was higher in the 3-weekly group than in the weekly group (96 versus 44), and the number of patients with grade 3-4 adverse events was also greater in the 3-weekly group (31 versus 20). Analysis of individual adverse events tended to favour the weekly regimen. Intent-to-treat overall response rate was 34% and 33% in the weekly and 3-weekly groups, respectively. Median time to progression was 5.7 and 5.3 months after weekly and 3-weekly docetaxel, respectively, and median time to treatment failure was 4.1 and 4.9 months, respectively. CONCLUSION: Weekly docetaxel is an active regimen in metastatic breast cancer with comparable efficacy to 3 weekly docetaxel. Although both schedules were well tolerated, weekly docetaxel appears to have a more favourable toxicity profile.",1
A phase III trial of sequential adjuvant chemotherapy for operable breast carcinoma: final analysis with 10-year follow-up.,"BACKGROUND: The current study was performed to assess whether sequential potentially noncross-resistant chemotherapy prolongs disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with operable breast carcinoma. METHODS: Seven hundred eighty-nine patients were registered and followed for a median of 10 years. They were treated in two groups. In Group 1, patients age < 50 years or age > 50 years but with either negative or unknown estrogen receptor (ER) status were randomized to receive 6 cycles of 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) alone or followed by 4 cycles of methotrexate and vinblastine (MV). In Group 2, patients age > or = 50 years with ER-positive disease were randomized to receive either tamoxifen or combination chemotherapy (FAC + MV) for 10 cycles. Analysis was performed according to allocated treatment (intention to treat), with all randomized patients included. RESULTS: In Group 1 there were no significant differences with regard to DFS or OS between the two treatment arms. The DFS at 5 years was 0.70 and 0.76, respectively, for FAC compared with FAC+MV (P = 0.26). The OS was similar for both groups (0.84 vs. 0.83). It is interesting to note that there was a statistically nonsignificant trend for improved DFS in the FAC + MV arm for patients who were ER-positive. In Group 2, tamoxifen alone led to more prolonged DFS compared to FAC+MV (0.78 vs. 0.66, respectively) but this did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.28). OS also was associated with a trend (P = 0.86) toward prolonged survival for the tamoxifen arm compared with the FAC+MV arm (0.85 vs. 0.74, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current trial concerning sequential adjuvant chemotherapy for operable breast carcinoma, which to our knowledge contains the longest follow-up presented to date, failed to demonstrate any additional benefit from the addition of 4 cycles of MV to 6 cycles of FAC chemotherapy.",1
Taxol (paclitaxel) in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma who have failed prior chemotherapy: interim results of a multinational study.,"A multinational, randomized study has been conducted to compare the effectiveness and safety of two doses of Taxol (paclitaxel) (135 and 175 mg/m2, given as a 3-hour intravenous infusion every 3 weeks) in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma who had previously undergone treatment with one or two chemotherapeutic regimens. A total of 471 patients were enrolled in the study; the first 117 were included in an interim analysis that was planned in the protocol to identify any extreme efficacy differences between the treatment arms. Most (85%) of these initial patients were ambulatory with a performance status of 0 or 1 and multiple sites of disease. Duration of treatment ranged from 1 to 7 courses (median, 4). Of the 113 patients who received Taxol 135 mg/m2 (n = 56) or 175 mg/m2 (n = 57), 111 were evaluable for an overall response rate of 27%, with 3 complete and 27 partial responses. In this interim analysis no significant difference in response rate between the two treatment groups was detected. The primary toxicity encountered was neutropenia that was rapidly reversible and not associated with treatment delays. It was concluded that at these doses Taxol is an effective and well-tolerated treatment option for the management of metastatic breast cancer in previously treated patients.",1
Combined treatment with buserelin and tamoxifen in premenopausal metastatic breast cancer: a randomized study.,"BACKGROUND: Surgical or medical castration and antiestrogenic treatment with tamoxifen are common endocrine treatments for premenopausal women with breast cancer. However, tamoxifen therapy induces high levels of plasma estradiol, with unknown long-term effects. In this study, we investigated the effect of combining estrogen suppression with the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist buserelin and estradiol receptor blockade with tamoxifen to determine whether the high estradiol levels induced by tamoxifen could be reduced and whether the antitumor effects would be better. METHODS: In a three-arm, randomized, prospective trial, from 1988 through 1995, a total of 161 premenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer were randomly assigned to treatment with buserelin, tamoxifen, or both. Patients with steroid receptor-negative tumors or with tumors of unknown receptor status who had a disease-free interval of less than 2 years were excluded. The median follow-up was 7.3 years, during which 76% of the patients died, all of breast cancer. Patient and tumor characteristics were well balanced among treatment groups. All P values are from two-sided tests. RESULTS: Combined treatment with buserelin and tamoxifen was superior to treatment with buserelin or tamoxifen alone by objective response rate (48%, 34%, and 28% of patients who could be evaluated, respectively; P =.11 [chi(2) test]), median progression-free survival (9.7 months, 6.3 months, and 5.6 months; P =.03), and overall survival (3.7 years, 2.5 years, and 2.9 years; P =.01). Actuarial 5-year survival percentages were 34.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 20.4%-48.0%), 14.9% (95% CI = 3.9%-25.9%), and 18.4% (95% CI = 7.0%-29.8%), respectively. No differences in antitumor effects were observed between single-agent treatment groups. During combined treatment or treatment with buserelin alone, plasma estradiol levels were suppressed equally; in contrast, during treatment with tamoxifen alone, plasma estradiol levels increased threefold to fourfold over pretreatment levels. CONCLUSION: Combined treatment with buserelin and tamoxifen was more effective and resulted in longer overall survival than treatment with either drug alone.",1
Randomized trial of adjuvant chemotherapy for operable breast cancer comparing i.v. CMF to an epirubicin-containing regimen [see comment].,"From January 1985 to December 1987, 228 women with breast cancer smaller than 3 cm were treated by surgery +/- radiotherapy. All of them had axillary node involvement (N+) and/or lacked estrogen and progesterone steroid receptors (EPR-). They were randomized in an adjuvant chemotherapy trial comparing 9 intravenous CMF courses (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5FU)--113 patients--to a polychemotherapy consisting of 3 courses of MTV (mitomycin C, thiotepa, vindesine) plus 3 courses of EVM (epirubicin, vincristine, methotrexate)--115 patients. Prognostic factors were well balanced between the two treatment groups. With a 59-month median follow-up, local breast relapses are more frequent in the CMF group, but regional and metastatic recurrences are the same in the two groups. Overall survival is identical. Toxicity is different: alopecia and neurotoxicity are more frequent in the MTV+EVM group, but general and digestive toxicities are equivalent. Haematologic toxicity is greater in the CMF group, requiring more frequent dosage reductions.",1
"Production of ex vivo expanded hematopoietic cells and progenitors in a closed bioreactor, starting with a small volume marrow collection: A feasibility study in patients with poor-risk breast cancer and receiving high-doses of cyclophosphamide.","We report a clinical pilot study conducted in 6 women with poor-prognosis breast cancer. The goal was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of producing hematopoietic progenitors and cells from a small marrow sample, for clinical use after high-dose cyclophosphamide. A small volume marrow collection was obtained, using local anesthesia and conscious sedation, before the first of two chemotherapy cycles. Cells were cryopreserved, and later thawed to inoculate two Aastrom Biosciences Inc Replicell bioreactors, on time to reinfuse ex vivo expanded cells after the second chemotherapy cycle. Patients recovered neutrophils and platelets at similar times after the first and second chemotherapy cycles, and showed comparable clinical events. This pilot study prepares future randomized trials, designed to evaluate clinical benefits associated with the use of ex vivo expanded cells in the setting of multicycle high-dose chemotherapy.",0
Management of anastrozole-induced bone loss in breast cancer patients with oral risedronate: results from the ARBI prospective clinical trial.,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this multicenter, phase III, prospective open label clinical trial was to investigate the effect of risedronate (R) on bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal, early breast cancer (BC) patients scheduled to receive anastrozole (A).METHODS: Pre-treatment BMD of 213 patients with hormone receptor-positive BC was evaluated at lumbar spine (LS) and hip (HP). Patients were categorized according to their baseline BMD T-score as being at low, moderate and high risk of osteoporosis. Low risk patients received anastrozole only (A), moderate risk were randomized to anastrozole +/- risedronate (A+/-R) administration and high risk patients received anastrozole + risedronate (A+R). Anastrozole was given at a dosage of 1 mg/day while oral risedronate was given at 35 mg/week. BMD was then assessed at 12 and 24 months. All patients received daily supplements of calcium (1000 mg/day) and vitamin D (400 IU/day).RESULTS: At 24 months, in the moderate risk group, treatment with A+R resulted in a significant increase in BMD at LS and HP compared to treatment with A only (5.7% v -1.5%, Wilcoxon test P = 0.006, and 1.6% v -3.9% Wilcoxon test P = 0.037, respectively), while no significant difference was found at 12 months; 24.3% of the patients moved to normal BMD region. In the high risk group, a significant increase for LS was detected both at 12 and 24 months (6.3% and 6.6%, P < 0.001) but not for HP; BMD in 14% of patients improved to the osteopenic region. In the low risk group, a significant decrease of BMD was detected at 12 months for LS and HP (-5.3% P < 0.001 and -2.4% P < 0.001, respectively,); at 24 months, a significant decrease of BMD was detected only for LS (-2.5%, P < 0.001). However, 22% of patients became osteopenic and only 4% became osteoporotic.CONCLUSIONS: The addition of oral risedronate in post-menopausal breast cancer patients receiving anastrozole has a favorable effect on BMD. Patients with pre-treatment osteopenic to osteoporotic status should be treated with a combination of both therapies in order to avoid bone loss induced by aromatase inhibition. Patients with normal BMD before starting treatment with anastrozole have a very low risk to develop osteoporosis.",0
Estrogen-receptor status and outcomes of modern chemotherapy for patients with node-positive breast cancer.,"CONTEXT: Breast cancer estrogen-receptor (ER) status is useful in predicting benefit from endocrine therapy. It may also help predict which patients benefit from advances in adjuvant chemotherapy. OBJECTIVE: To compare differences in benefits from adjuvant chemotherapy achieved by patients with ER-negative vs ER-positive tumors. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Trial data from the Cancer and Leukemia Group B and US Breast Cancer Intergroup analyzed; patient outcomes by ER status compared using hazards over time and multivariate models. Randomized trials comparing (1): 3 regimens of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (January 1985 to April 1991); (2) 3 doses of doxorubicin concurrent with cyclophosphamide, with or without subsequent paclitaxel (May 1994 to April 1997); (3) sequential doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and cyclophosphamide with concurrent doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel, and also 3-week vs 2-week cycles (September 1997 to March 1999). A total of 6644 node-positive breast cancer patients received adjuvant treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Disease-free and overall survival. RESULTS: For ER-negative tumors, chemotherapy improvements reduced the relative risk of recurrence by 21%, 25%, and 23% in the 3 studies, respectively, and 55% comparing the lowest dose in the first study with biweekly cycles in the third study. Corresponding relative risk reductions for ER-positive tumors treated with tamoxifen were 9%, 12%, and 8% in the 3 studies, and 26% overall. The overall mortality rate reductions associated with chemotherapy improvements were 55% and 23% among ER-negative and ER-positive patients, respectively. All individual ER-negative comparisons and no ER-positive comparisons were statistically significant. Absolute benefits due to chemotherapy were greater for patients with ER-negative compared with ER-positive tumors: 22.8% more ER-negative patients survived to 5 years disease-free if receiving chemotherapy vs 7.0% for ER-positive patients; corresponding improvements for overall survival were 16.7% vs 4.0%. CONCLUSION: Among patients with node-positive tumors, ER-negative breast cancer, biweekly doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide plus paclitaxel lowers the rate of recurrence and death by more than 50% in comparison with low-dose cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil as used in the first study.",0
Incidence of new primary cancers after adjuvant tamoxifen therapy and radiotherapy for early breast cancer.,"The incidence of new primary cancers was evaluated in 3538 postmenopausal patients who had received surgical treatment for primary breast cancer. Of these patients, 1828 with a low risk of recurrence received no further treatment. High-risk patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups. The first group (n = 846) received postoperative radiotherapy, while the second group (n = 864) received radiotherapy plus tamoxifen at a dose of 30 mg given daily for 48 weeks. The median observation time was 7.9 years. In comparison with the number of new cancers in the general population, the number of new cancers in the three groups was elevated mostly due to a high number of cancers of the contralateral breast and of colorectal cancers in the high-risk groups. The cumulative risk of nonlymphatic leukemia was increased among patients who received postoperative radiotherapy (P = .04). Cancer incidence in the high-risk tamoxifen-treated group relative to that in the high-risk group not treated with tamoxifen was not significant (1.3). No protective effect of tamoxifen on the opposite breast was seen (rate ratio for breast cancer = 1.1), but a tendency to an elevated risk of endometrial cancer was observed (rate ratio = 3.3; 95% confidence interval = 0.6-32.4). Continued and careful follow-up of women treated with tamoxifen is necessary to clarify the potential cancer-suppressive or cancer-promoting effects of this drug.",0
Effects of tamoxifen on the female genital tract.,"Tamoxifen is a widely used drug in medical oncology, mainly for treatment of breast cancer, but also for second line treatment of endometrial cancer. We recently reported an increased incidence of endometrial cancer associated with long-term adjuvant tamoxifen. This observation, previous reports of stimulatory effects of tamoxifen in the female genital tract, and experimental data are in accordance with a mainly estrogenic effect of tamoxifen in these tissues. An increased incidence of endometrial cancer may limit the usefulness of tamoxifen for benign indications. For adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer, however, the improvement of both recurrence-free survival and overall survival probably outweighs the increased frequency of uterine tumors. However, the possibility of growth stimulation of tumor subclones should be considered when tamoxifen is used in the treatment of endometrial cancer.",0
Feasibility of a cell kinetic-based adjuvant chemotherapy trial in axillary node-negative breast cancer.,"AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Accumulated information on biologic prognostic indicators and predictors of response to different types of treatment in patients with different tumor characteristics has made it possible to design clinical protocols on biologic bases. Among cell proliferation indices, the thymidine labelling index (TLI) has proved to be an independent and consistent prognostic indicator over time. Moreover, experimental and retrospective analyses of clinical studies have revealed a direct relation between TLI and response to chemotherapy. On the basis of the results, a prospective clinical protocol on axillary node-negative breast cancer was activated in Italy in 1989. METHODS: Patients with low TLI tumors were treated with local-regional therapy alone, whereas patients with high TLI tumors were randomized to receive local-regional therapy followed or not by adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of 6 cycles of CMF. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The present paper reports on the feasibility of a prospective clinical protocol based on a subgroup of patients with specific pathologic (node negative) and biologic (rapidly proliferating) breast cancers. However, patient eligibility was only 11%.",0
Letrozole as upfront endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone-sensitive breast cancer: BIG 1-98.,"The BIG 1-98 trial is a large, randomized, independently conducted clinical trial designed to compare the efficacy of upfront letrozole versus tamoxifen monotherapy and to compare sequential or up-front use of letrozole and/or tamoxifen as an early adjuvant therapy for patients with early breast cancer. We report on the results from the primary core analysis of the BIG 1-98 trial of 8,010 patients, which compares monotherapy with letrozole versus tamoxifen. This pre-planned core analysis allowed the use of patient data from the monotherapy arms of letrozole and tamoxifen and from the sequential arms prior to the drug switch point. Patients randomized to letrozole had a 19% improved disease-free survival (hazard ratio [HR]=0.81; P=0.003), due especially to reduced distant metastases (HR=0.73; P=0.001). A 14% risk reduction of fatal events in favor of letrozole was also observed (P=NS). The results from the monotherapy arms alone confirmed the findings from the primary core analysis. Based on the results from this trial, the aromatase inhibitor letrozole (Femara) is currently recommended as a part of standard adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal women with endocrine-responsive breast cancer and has recently been approved in the early adjuvant setting in both Europe and the United States. A subsequent analysis after additional follow-up will address the question of monotherapy versus sequential therapy.",1
"Estrogen-receptor-directed neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer: results of a randomised trial using formestane and methotrexate, mitozantrone and mitomycin C (MMM) chemotherapy.","BACKGROUND: We wanted to determine whether neoadjuvant systemic chemoendocrine therapy guided by the estrogen receptor (ER) status of the primary breast cancer, followed by conventional surgery and/or radiotherapy, reduces local and distant recurrence and improves survival compared with adjuvant treatment given conventionally postoperatively. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred ten patients with primary breast cancer (T1-T4, N0, N1-2) were randomised to receive treatment with neoadjuvant chemoendocrine therapy or conventional post-operative chemoendocrine therapy. Systemic therapy was based on the estrogen receptor (ER) status of the primary tumour obtained by trucut core biopsy. ER-negative patients received MMM chemotherapy (methotrexate (30 mg/m2), mitozantrone (7 mg/m2) and mitomycin (7 mg/m2) three-weekly for three months and ER-positive patients who were premenopausal received goserelin (3.75 mg monthly), and post menopausal women formestane (250 mg every two weeks) over three months. RESULTS: With a minimum of five years follow-up, there is no evidence of any survival benefit from the pretreatment neoadjuvant therapy regimen, with five year overall survival being 79% +/- 4.7% (neoadjuvant) and 87% +/- 3.4% (adjuvant). Similarly, there was no apparent benefit in terms of disease-free survival. There was, however, a significant reduction in the incidence of distant metastases in responders (4 of 51; 8%) compared with non-responders (17 of 49; 35%) (P < 0.01). There was a reduction in the need for surgery in responding patients with T1 and T2 tumours, since 10 of 74 (14%) had no detectable residual tumour, without any apparent increase in the risk of local or distant recurrence. CONCLUSION: In this study neoadjuvant treatment with endocrine or chemotherapy provided no obvious survival benefit to women with breast cancer. However, it does allow avoidance of surgery in some cases. Also, the patients whose tumours respond to neoadjuvant systemic therapy have a lower incidence of distant metastases after five year follow-up compared to those whose tumours fail to respond.",1
Tamoxifen and fluoxymesterone in advanced breast cancer: a controlled clinical trial.,"Seventy-nine postmenopausal women with stage IV breast cancer and no previous endocrine therapy or chemotherapy received tamoxifen or fluoxymesterone in an open, randomized, cross-over trial. The overall remission rate was 30% with tamoxifen as the first course of treatment and 19% with fluoxymesterone as the first course of treatment. Bone metastases were seen in 21 patients receiving tamoxifen and in 20 patients receiving fluoxymesterone. There were six and five remissions in these two groups respectively. The time to the first change in therapy was significantly longer for the tamoxifen group (P = 0.003). The survival of the patients who received tamoxifen as the first course of endocrine treatment was better (P = 0.05).",1
"Evaluation of peripheral morphine analgesia for lumpectomy and axillary node dissection: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Morphine may elicit potent antinociceptive effects by binding and activating peripheral opioid receptors. However, the results in clinical studies have varied. We examined the postoperative analgesic effects of incisional morphine in patients undergoing lumpectomies and axillary node dissections for breast cancer. For this purpose, a concentration of morphine within the range (0.25-0.6%) of those utilized in previous studies for postarthroscopy analgesia was chosen (0.6%). METHODS: Forty-five patients scheduled to undergo a lumpectomy and axillary node dissections for breast cancer were enrolled in this study after receiving Ethics Committee approval and patient consent. Patients were randomized to undergo irrigation of the surgical sites for 5 minutes prior to skin closure with 6 mg morphine diluted in 100 mL 0.9% normal saline (NS) and placebo intramuscular (i.m.) (peripheral MS group), 100 mL of 0.9% NS alone and placebo i.m. (placebo group), or 100 mL of 0.9% NS and 6 mg morphine i.m. in the deltoid muscle (i.m. MS group) in a double-blind fashion. In the postanesthesia care unit, patients received fentanyl via a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) device programmed to deliver 25 microg every 10 minutes to a maximum dose of 150 microg/h. Patients were evaluated for pain using a visual analog scale card from 0-10, opioid consumption, and incidences of side effects at 2, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours after surgery. RESULTS: All patients had adequate analgesia at rest and during arm movement with visual analog pain scores (VAPS) <3/10 throughout the study period. There were no significant differences in demographics, total fentanyl consumption (500 vs. 475 vs 933 microg, respectively; P = .2), VAPS at rest and during arm movement as well as fentanyl consumption at the different evaluation points among the three groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that under the conditions of the study protocol, there is no value in utilizing morphine in solution at the surgical site for postoperative lumpectomy and axillary node dissection analgesia.",0
Molecular subtypes of breast cancer in relation to paclitaxel response and outcomes in women with metastatic disease: results from CALGB 9342.,"INTRODUCTION: The response to paclitaxel varies widely in metastatic breast cancer. We analyzed data from CALGB 9342, which tested three doses of paclitaxel in women with advanced disease, to determine whether response and outcomes differed according to HER2, hormone receptor, and p53 status. METHODS: Among 474 women randomly assigned to paclitaxel at a dose of 175, 210, or 250 mg/m2, adequate primary tumor tissue was available from 175. Immunohistochemistry with two antibodies and fluorescence in situ hybridization were performed to evaluate HER2 status; p53 status was determined by immunohistochemistry and sequencing. Hormone receptor status was obtained from pathology reports. RESULTS: Objective response rate was not associated with HER2 or p53 status. There was a trend toward a shorter median time to treatment failure among women with HER2-positive tumors (2.3 versus 4.2 months; P = 0.067). HER2 status was not related to overall survival (OS). Hormone receptor expression was not associated with differences in response but was associated with longer OS (P = 0.003). In contrast, women with p53 over-expression had significantly shorter OS than those without p53 over-expression (11.5 versus 14.4 months; P = 0.002). In addition, triple negative tumors were more frequent in African-American than in Caucasian patients, and were associated with a significant reduction in OS (8.7 versus 12.9 months; P = 0.008). CONCLUSION: None of the biomarkers was predictive of treatment response in women with metastatic breast cancer; however, survival differed according to hormone receptor and p53 status. Triple negative tumors were more frequent in African-American patients and were associated with a shorter survival.",0
Influence of adjuvant chemotherapy on the blood lymphocyte population in operable breast carcinoma. Comparison between two types of treatments.,"The influence on the blood lymphocyte population of two types of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy regimes given to patients with large breast tumors or involved axillary lymph nodes have been examined. Cyclic treatment with a combination of chlorambucil, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil was more myelotoxic and required more extensive dose reductions than treatment with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil with the dosage used. Both treatments reduced the size of the blood lymphocyte population and changed its cellular composition, as defined by rosette tests, to approximately the same extent. Response of the lymphocytes to specific and non-specific mitogens were also affected to approximately the same extent. A comparison of the clinical value between the two treatments has not yet been performed.",0
Postoperative radiotherapy in high-risk premenopausal women with breast cancer who receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group 82b Trial.,"BACKGROUND: Irradiation after mastectomy can reduce locoregional recurrences in women with breast cancer, but whether it prolongs survival remains controversial. We conducted a randomized trial of radiotherapy after mastectomy in high-risk premenopausal women, all of whom also received adjuvant systemic chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF). METHODS: A total of 1708 women who had undergone mastectomy for pathological stage II or III breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive eight cycles of CMF plus irradiation of the chest wall and regional lymph nodes (852 women) or nine cycles of CMF alone (856 women). The median length of follow-up was 114 months. The end points were locoregional recurrence, distant metastases, disease-free survival, and overall survival. RESULTS: The frequency of locoregional recurrence alone or with distant metastases was 9 percent among the women who received radiotherapy plus CMF and 32 percent among those who received CMF alone (P<0.001). The probability of survival free of disease after 10 years was 48 percent among the women assigned to radiotherapy plus CMF and 34 percent among those treated only with CMF (P<0.001). Overall survival at 10 years was 54 percent among those given radiotherapy and CMF and 45 percent among those who received CMF alone (P<0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that irradiation after mastectomy significantly improved disease-free survival and overall survival, irrespective of tumor size, the number of positive nodes, or the histopathological grade. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of postoperative irradiation to mastectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy reduces locoregional recurrences and prolongs survival in high-risk premenopausal women with breast cancer.",0
The effect of raloxifene on risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women: results from the MORE randomized trial. Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation.,"CONTEXT: Raloxifene hydrochloride is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that has antiestrogenic effects on breast and endometrial tissue and estrogenic effects on bone, lipid metabolism, and blood clotting. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether women taking raloxifene have a lower risk of invasive breast cancer. DESIGN AND SETTING: The Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation (MORE), a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial, in which women taking raloxifene or placebo were followed up for a median of 40 months (SD, 3 years), from 1994 through 1998, at 180 clinical centers composed of community settings and medical practices in 25 countries, mainly in the United States and Europe. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 7705 postmenopausal women, younger than 81 (mean age, 66.5) years, with osteoporosis, defined by the presence of vertebral fractures or a femoral neck or spine T-score of at least 2.5 SDs below the mean for young healthy women. Almost all participants (96%) were white. Women who had a history of breast cancer or who were taking estrogen were excluded. INTERVENTION: Raloxifene, 60 mg, 2 tablets daily; or raloxifene, 60 mg, 1 tablet daily and 1 placebo tablet; or 2 placebo tablets. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: New cases of breast cancer, confirmed by histopathology. Transvaginal ultrasonography was used to assess the endometrial effects of raloxifene in 1781 women. Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism were determined by chart review. RESULTS: Thirteen cases of breast cancer were confirmed among the 5129 women assigned to raloxifene vs 27 among the 2576 women assigned to placebo (relative risk [RR], 0.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.13-0.44; P<.001). To prevent 1 case of breast cancer, 126 women would need to be treated. Raloxifene decreased the risk of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer by 90% (RR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.04-0.24), but not estrogen receptor-negative invasive breast cancer (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.26-3.0). Raloxifene increased the risk of venous thromboembolic disease (RR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.5-6.2), but did not increase the risk of endometrial cancer (RR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.2-2.7). CONCLUSION: Among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, the risk of invasive breast cancer was decreased by 76% during 3 years of treatment with raloxifene.",0
"The ATAC ('Arimidex', Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination) adjuvant breast cancer trial: first results of the endometrial sub-protocol following 2 years of treatment.","BACKGROUND: Tamoxifen treatment results in a doubling of the risk of endometrial cancer after 1-2 years of treatment and a quadrupling after 5 years. Anastrozole, a third-generation aromatase inhibitor, with superior efficacy to tamoxifen, may also offer tolerability benefits in terms of effects on the endometrium. METHODS AND RESULTS: A sub-protocol of the ATAC trial compared the incidence/type of intrauterine changes following treatment with these agents in a subgroup of patients (n = 285) from the main trial. After 2 years anastrozole treatment, endometrial thickness remained </= 5 mm (baseline: 3.0 mm); in patients receiving tamoxifen, endometrial thickness increased by 3.2 mm to 7.0 mm, with a similar trend in the combination group. At baseline, 26/285 patients (9.1%) had endometrial abnormalities, most commonly polyps. After 2 years the number of endometrial abnormalities appeared lower with anastrozole treatment compared with tamoxifen although these differences were not statistically significant (odds ratio: 0.44; 95% confidence interval 0.146, 1.314; P = 0.14). Most abnormalities occurred within the first year of treatment (anastrozole: 4/6; tamoxifen: 7/10; combination: 10/16; total: 21/32). Fewer patients in the anastrozole group (1.4%) required medical intervention (tamoxifen 12.5%; combination 13.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Fewer endometrial abnormalities occurred during 2 years treatment with anastrozole compared with tamoxifen although statistical significance was not reached in this sub-protocol analysis.",0

ErbB2 status and the benefit from two or five years of adjuvant tamoxifen in postmenopausal early stage breast cancer.,"AIM: We aimed to study the importance of erbB2 status in early stage postmenopausal breast cancer for patients who participated in a trial of five vs. two years of adjuvant tamoxifen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analysed the erbB2 status of the tumours from 577 patients participating in the trial, either by a DNA amplification assay (n = 181) or by measurement of the protein level with flow cytometry (n = 396). RESULTS: ErbB2 was overexpressed or gene amplified in 102 of the patients (18%). Overall, erbB2-positive patients had a significantly lower recurrence-free probability than others, 62% at five years as compared to 83%, and showed a significantly decreased breast cancer survival rate (P = 0.0007). ErbB2 status was significantly associated with recurrence and death in Cox multivariate analysis, adjusting for nodal status, tumour size and estrogen receptor status. The relative risk of recurrence (RR) for five vs. two years of tamoxifen was analysed in relation to erbB2 status for patients still disease-free two years after surgery. Whereas erbB2-negative patients showed significant benefit from prolonged treatment (RR = 0.62, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.42-0.93), no benefit was evident for erbB2-positive patients (RR = 1.1, 95% CI: 0.41-3.2). When the same analysis was restricted to ER-positive patients a similar difference in relative hazard was obtained but the difference was not strictly significant (P = 0.065). CONCLUSIONS: For early stage breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen, overexpression of erbB2 is an independent marker of poor prognosis. The results suggest that overexpression decreases the benefit from prolonged tamoxifen treatment.",0
"Estrogen receptor-alpha phosphorylation at serine 305, nuclear p21-activated kinase 1 expression, and response to tamoxifen in postmenopausal breast cancer.","PURPOSE: In vitro, p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1) phosphorylates the serine 305 residue of the estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and influences the response of breast cancer cells to tamoxifen. We investigated the influence of Pak1 and pERalpha(ser305) on breast cancer prognosis and results of tamoxifen therapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We examined Pak1 and pERalpha(ser305) protein by immunohistochemistry in a series of 912 tumors from node-negative breast cancer patients randomized to tamoxifen or no adjuvant endocrine treatment. RESULTS: Cytoplasmic Pak1 correlated to large tumors and ER negativity, whereas nuclear Pak1 and pERalpha(ser305) correlated to small tumors and ER positivity. Nuclear expression of Pak1 and pERalpha(ser305) predicted reduced response to tamoxifen in patients with ERalpha-positive tumors (tamoxifen versus no tamoxifen: hazard ratio (HR), 1.33; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.42-4.2; P = 0.63), whereas patients lacking this combination benefitted significantly from tamoxifen (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.30-0.62; P < 0.0001). Similar nonsignificant trends were detected in analyses of the proteins separately. Pak1 in the cytoplasm was an independent prognostic marker, indicating increased recurrence rate (HR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.17-2.74; P = 0.0068) and breast cancer mortality (HR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.14-3.46; P = 0.016) for patients randomized to no adjuvant treatment. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that patients with tumors expressing Pak1 and pERalpha(ser305) in combination are a group in which tamoxifen treatment is insufficient. In addition, the pathway may be of interest as a drug target in breast cancer. Furthermore, the findings support previous studies showing that Pak1 has differential roles in the cytoplasm and the nucleus.",0
"A randomized multicenter trial comparing mitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide, and fluorouracil with doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and fluorouracil in the therapy of metastatic breast carcinoma.","Three hundred thirty-one women with metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive combination chemotherapy with either cyclophosphamide, Novantrone (mitoxantrone; Lederle Laboratories, Wayne, NJ), and fluorouracil (CNF) or cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), and fluorouracil (CAF). Patients could not have had prior chemotherapy, although adjuvant chemotherapy was acceptable. Initial doses were 500 mg/m2 of cyclophosphamide and 500 mg/m2 of fluorouracil with either 10 mg/m2 of mitoxantrone or 50 mg/m2 of doxorubicin, administered intravenously (IV) on day 1 and repeated every 3 weeks. There were no statistically significant differences in pretreatment or prior therapy characteristics between the groups. For patients assigned to the CNF and CAF groups, respectively, 25 (18%) were premenopausal, 39 (40%) were estrogen receptor (ER) negative, 39 (38%) had a disease-free interval less than 1 year, and 24 (26%) had received prior adjuvant chemotherapy. All patients were compared for response rate, duration of response, time to progression or death, time to treatment failure (TTF), and survival. None of these parameters were statistically significant favoring one regimen over the other. The response rate (complete [CR] and partial response [PR]) was 29% for the CNF group (95% confidence interval of 22% to 37%) and 37% for the CAF group (95% confidence interval of 29% to 45%). The median response duration and TTF were 171 days and 125 days for the CNF group and 254 days and 147 days for the CAF group, respectively. The median survival times for the CNF group and the CAF group were 377 and 385 days, respectively. The major dose-limiting toxicity for both regimens was leukopenia, manifested as granulocytopenia. The incidence of stomatitis/mucositis was 10% in the CNF group and 19% in the CAF group. Alopecia occurred in 49% of CNF patients (severely for 4%) and in 86% of CAF patients (severely for 39%). Nausea/vomiting occurred in 80% of CNF patients and in 81% of CAF patients; the degree of severity was also comparable. There was significantly less cardiotoxicity observed in the CNF group compared with the CAF group. Although CNF is somewhat less effective in overall response rate, survival curves are identical. CNF can be offered to patients who reject anthracycline-containing regimens because of fear of alopecia.",1
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and bevacizumab for HER2-negative breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor A, has shown clinical efficacy in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative metastatic breast cancer. We evaluated the efficacy, measured according to the rate of pathological complete response (absence of invasive and intraductal disease in the breast and the axillary lymph nodes), and the safety of adding bevacizumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with early-stage breast cancer. METHODS: We randomly assigned 1948 patients with a median tumor size of 40 mm on palpation to receive neoadjuvant epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel, with or without concomitant bevacizumab. Patients with untreated HER2-negative breast cancer were eligible if they had large tumors, hormone-receptor-negative disease, or hormone-receptor-positive disease with palpable nodes or positive findings on sentinel-node biopsy, and no increased cardiovascular or bleeding risk. RESULTS: Overall, the rates of pathological complete response were 14.9% with epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel and 18.4% with epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel plus bevacizumab (odds ratio with addition of bevacizumab, 1.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.65; P=0.04); the corresponding rates of pathological complete response were 27.9% and 39.3% among 663 patients with triple-negative tumors (P=0.003) and 7.8% and 7.7% among 1262 patients with hormone-receptor-positive tumors (P=1.00). Breast-conserving surgery was possible in 66.6% of the patients in both groups. The addition of bevacizumab, as compared with neoadjuvant therapy alone, was associated with a higher incidence of grade 3 or 4 toxic effects (febrile neutropenia, mucositis, the hand-foot syndrome, infection, and hypertension) but with a similar incidence of surgical complications. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of bevacizumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy significantly increased the rate of pathological complete response among patients with HER2-negative early-stage breast cancer. Efficacy was restricted primarily to patients with triple-negative tumors, in whom the pathological complete response is considered to be a reliable predictor of long-term outcome.

Four-day infusion of fluorouracil plus vinorelbine as salvage treatment of heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer.,"AIMS: Anthracyclines-taxanes containing regimens are widely used for breast cancer treatment both in neoadjuvant-adjuvant setting and in metastatic disease. Recently high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) with autologous stem cell support has been introduced as adjuvant treatment for high-risk primary breast cancer and for selected subsets of women with metastatic disease. Therefore, salvage treatment for previously treated patients with progressive disease becomes even more problematic. A regimen of continuous infusion of fluorouracil (FU) and vinorelbine (VNR) has been evaluated in heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-eight women, median age 52 years, with previously treated breast cancer entered the study. All but one received more than one line of prior systemic chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Furthermore 14 women had undergone HDC with peripheral blood progenitor cells transplantation in adjuvant setting (6 pts), or metastatic disease (8 pts). Treatment consisted of four-day infusion of FU (1000 mg/m2/day) plus VNR (20 mg/m2/i.v. day 1 and 5), recycled every 3 weeks for a total of six courses. Drugs administration was discontinued for G4 toxicity, tumor progression or patient's refusal. RESULTS: Twenty PR and four CR for an overall response rate of 50% (95%C.I. 36-64%) were recorded. The therapeutic efficacy of the tested regimen was documented both in patients unresponsive to previous anthracyclines-taxanes combinations and in those relapsing after HDC. The median duration of response was 9 months and median survival 16 months. One third of patients experienced Grade-3 stomatitis-mucositis, hematological toxicity was mild and no cardiac toxicity was observed. Twenty-five women (52%) suffered from infusion-related phlebitis (in half of patients a central venous device was necessary at some point of the treatment program). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of FU infusion and VNR i.v. is an effective salvage treatment for heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer patients, and may represent a valid alternative when other cytotoxic regimens are not feasible.",1
Mechanisms of stimulation of granulocytopoiesis with neupogen in patients with breast cancer during chemotherapy.,"The mechanisms of granulocytopoiesis stimulation with granulocytic CSF (neupogen), added to chemotherapy protocol (adriablastine+taxotere) in patients with stages III-IV breast cancer, were studied.

"Skeletal effects of exemestane on bone-mineral density, bone biomarkers, and fracture incidence in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer participating in the Intergroup Exemestane Study (IES): a randomised controlled study.","BACKGROUND: Tamoxifen preserves bone in postmenopausal women, but non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors accelerate bone loss and increase fracture risk. We aimed to study the effect on bone health in a subgroup of women included in the Intergroup Exemestane Study (IES), a large randomised trial that compared the switch to the steroidal aromatase inhibitor exemestane with continuation of tamoxifen in the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal breast cancer. METHODS: Results were analysed from 206 evaluable patients from the IES, in which postmenopausal women with histologically confirmed and completely resected unilateral breast cancer (that was oestrogen-receptor positive or of unknown status), who were disease-free after 2-3 years of treatment with tamoxifen were randomised to continue oral tamoxifen 20 mg/day or switch to oral exemestane 25 mg/day to complete a total of 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy. The primary endpoint was change in bone-mineral density (BMD) assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Changes in biochemical markers of bone turnover were also analysed in this substudy, and the incidence of fractures in the entire study reported. The IES is registered on the Current Controlled Trials website . FINDINGS: Within 6 months of switching to exemestane, BMD was lowered by 0.051 g/cm(3) (2.7%; 95% CI 2.0-3.4; p<0.0001) at the lumbar spine and 0.025 g/cm(3) (1.4%; 0.8-1.9; p<0.0001) at the hip compared with baseline. BMD decreases were only 1.0% (0.4-1.7; p=0.002) and 0.8% (0.3-1.4; p=0.003) in year 2 at the lumbar spine and hip, respectively. No patient with BMD in the normal range at trial entry developed osteoporosis. Bone resorption and formation markers increased at all time points in women receiving exemestane (p<0.001). With a median follow-up in all IES participants (n=4274) of 58 months, 162 (7%) and 115 (5%) patients in the exemestane and tamoxifen groups, respectively, had fractures (odds ratio 1.45 [1.13-1.87]; p=0.003). INTERPRETATION: These results indicate that the increase in survival shown previously with the IES switch strategy is achieved at the expense of some detriment to skeletal health, so the risk-benefit ratio to women needs to be individually assessed.",0
A multicentre trial to compare a loading dose regimen of tamoxifen ('Nolvadex') with conventional dosing in the treatment of advanced breast cancer. The British Tamoxifen Study Group.,"In this open randomized trial 193 eligible patients with advanced breast cancer were randomized to either a conventional schedule of tamoxifen (40 mg/day) or a loading dose schedule (160 mg for two days followed by 40 mg/day). Response was assessed every three weeks for the first three months and at three-monthly intervals thereafter. The loading dose regimen did not confer any benefit to the patients in terms of time taken to obtain a clinical response, rate and duration of response and subsequent survival even though steady-state plasma levels are achieved at least two weeks earlier with a loading dose regimen.",1
Molecular biomarkers for breast cancer prognosis: coexpression of c-erbB-2 and p53.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the prognostic significance of molecular biomarkers, particularly c-erbB-2 and p53, through study of prospective clinical data and archival breast cancer tissues for women accrued to the Alabama Breast Cancer Project. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Defining molecular abnormalities in breast cancer is an important strategy for early detection, assessment of prognosis, and treatment selection. Evidence is strong that selective biomarkers, including c-erbB-2 and p53, have prognostic significance in breast cancer. Few studies have analyzed the prognostic significance of coexpression of biomarkers. METHODS: Study patients were those accrued to the Alabama Breast Cancer Project (1975-1978) who had archival breast cancer tissues available for analysis. Criteria for entrance into the Alabama Breast Cancer Project were T1-3 breast cancer with M0 status. Age, nodal status, and histologic grade were also documented. Patients were randomized to radical versus modified radical mastectomy, and node-positive patients were also randomized to adjuvant chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil [CMF]) versus melphalan. Archival breast cancer tissues were studied for c-erbB-2, TGF-alpha, p53, cathepsin D, bcl-2, and estrogen and progesterone receptor expression using immunohistochemistry. Survival curves were developed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate analysis was performed using the log-rank test, multivariate analysis using a rank regression model. RESULTS: Three hundred eleven patients were accrued to the Alabama Breast Cancer Project, and paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissues for 90 patients were available for immunohistochemical analysis of molecular biomarkers. Univariate analysis showed nodal status, c-erbB-2 expression, and p53 expression to have prognostic significance. Coexpression of c-erbB-2 and p53 was also found to have prognostic significance by the log-rank test. Multivariate analysis showed T stage, nodal status, c-erbB-2 expression, and p53 expression to have independent prognostic significance. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that c-erbB-2 and p53 expression in breast cancer have prognostic significance. After median follow-up of 16 years, coexpression of c-erbB-2 and p53 may have more prognostic significance than traditional prognostic factors such as T stage and nodal status. Prospective study of large numbers of patients with breast cancer is encouraged to validate these findings.",0
Homeopathy for menopausal symptoms in breast cancer survivors: a preliminary randomized controlled trial.,"OBJECTIVES: To carry out a preliminary trial evaluating the effectiveness of two types of homeopathy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms in breast cancer survivors. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled. SETTINGS/LOCATION: Private medical clinic, Seattle, WA. SUBJECTS: Women with a history of breast cancer who had completed all surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation treatment and who had an average of at least three hot flashes per day for the previous month. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were randomized to receive either an individualized homeopathic single remedy, a homeopathic combination medicine, or placebo. Patients were seen by homeopathic providers every 2 months for 1 year. OUTCOME MEASURES: Hot flash frequency and severity, Kupperman Menopausal Index (KMI), Short Form 36 (SF-36). RESULTS: There was no significant difference found in the primary outcome measure, the hot flash severity score, although there was a positive trend in the single remedy group during the first 3 months of the study (p = 0.1). A statistically significant improvement in general health score in both homeopathy groups (p < 0.05) on the SF-36 after 1 year was found. Evidence of a homeopathic ""drug proving"" in the subjects receiving the homeopathic combination medicine who were not taking tamoxifen also was found. CONCLUSIONS: Small sample size precludes definitive answers, but results from this preliminary trial suggest that homeopathy may be of value in the treatment of menopausal symptoms and improving quality of life, especially in those women not on tamoxifen. Larger studies should be carried out that also include healthy women who want to avoid hormone replacement therapy.",0
"Prospective evaluation of prognostic factors uPA/PAI-1 in node-negative breast cancer: phase III NNBC3-Europe trial (AGO, GBG, EORTC-PBG) comparing 6×FEC versus 3×FEC/3×Docetaxel.","BACKGROUND: Today, more than 70% of patients with primary node-negative breast cancer are cured by local therapy alone. Many patients receive overtreatment by adjuvant chemotherapy due to inadequate risk assessment. So far, few clinical trials have prospectively evaluated tumor biology based prognostic factors. Risk assessment by a biological algorithm including invasion factors urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and its inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) will assess up to 35-55% of node-negative patients as low-risk and thus avoid chemotherapy. In contrast, a clinical-pathological algorithm will only classify 20-40% of patients as low-risk. High-risk node-negative patients should receive chemotherapy. Anthracycline-based regimens are accepted as a standard, the additional benefit of taxanes remains an open question. METHODS/DESIGN: The international NNBC3 (""Node Negative Breast Cancer 3-Europe"") trial compares biological risk assessment (UP) using invasion factors uPA/PAI-1 with a clinical-pathological algorithm (CP). In this trial, the type of risk assessment (CP or UP) was chosen upfront by each center for its patients. Fresh frozen tissue was obtained to determine uPA/PAI-1 using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Patients assessed as high-risk were stratified by human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status and then randomised to receive anthracycline-containing chemotherapy 5-Fluorouracil (F)/Epirubicin (E)/Cyclophosphymide (C) or an anthracycline-taxane sequence (FE(100)C*6 versus FE(100)C*3 followed by Docetaxel(100)*3). DISCUSSION: In this trial, 4,149 node-negative patients with operable breast cancer from 153 centers in Germany and France were included since 2002. Measurement of uPA/PAI-1 by ELISA was performed with standardised central quality assurance for 2,497 patients (60%) from 56 ""UP""-centers. The NNBC 3-Europe trial showed that inclusion of patients into a clinical phase III trial is feasible based on biological testing of fresh frozen tumor material. In addition, 2,661 patients were classified as high-risk and thus received chemotherapy. As adjuvant chemotherapy, 1,334 high-risk patients received FE(100)C-Docetaxel(100), and 1,327 received French FE(100)C. No unexpected toxicities were observed. Chemotherapy efficacy and comparison of UP with CP will be evaluated after longer follow-up. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinical Trials.gov NCT01222052.",0
Combination chemotherapy in advanced postmenopausal mammary carcinoma. A comparison between VAC and VACM therapy.,"A randomized trial comparing Vincristine, Adriamycin, Cyclophosphamide (VAC) with or without Methotrexate with citrovorum factor rescue (VACM) was performed in 64 patients with metastatic postmenopausal mammary carcinoma. Previous treatment of metastases, dominant site of metastases and performance condition were similar in the patients. No significant difference was found in the response rates (complete remission + partial remission; VAC 21/31, VACM 25/33), in the duration of the remissions or in the survivals. The duration of remission in CR was significantly longer than in PR. No serious side effects were observed. The VAC regimen is preferable, particularly with respect to the costs and the simple procedure of administration.",1

Comparison of menopausal symptoms during the first year of adjuvant therapy with either exemestane or tamoxifen in early breast cancer: report of a Tamoxifen Exemestane Adjuvant Multicenter trial substudy.,"PURPOSE: Hormonal breast cancer treatment increases menopausal symptoms in women. This study investigated differences between the symptoms associated with either adjuvant tamoxifen or exemestane. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten common symptoms were assessed by self-report questionnaire administered to 1,614 consecutive patients at baseline and every 3 months during the first year of a double-blind, randomized trial of postmenopausal women with early hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Symptoms were categorized as none, mild, moderate, or severe. A hot flash score was calculated at each time point. Symptoms were analyzed by repeated-measures analysis of variance. Each time period was tested repeatedly against the baseline; an overall P value was assigned for each reported symptom. RESULTS: Compliance was excellent, with 7,286 questionnaires analyzed. Baseline symptom prevalence ranged from 2% (vaginal bleeding) to 60% to 70% (bone/muscle aches and low energy). There were no significant differences in vaginal bleeding, mood alteration, or low energy. Patients receiving tamoxifen had significantly more vaginal discharge (P < .0001). Exemestane patients reported more bone/muscle aches (P < .0001), vaginal dryness (P = .0004), and difficulty sleeping (P = .03). In both groups, the hot flash score peaked at 3 months and decreased thereafter. At 12 months, patients receiving tamoxifen had a significantly higher mean hot flash score (P = .03), with daily hot flashes increasing from baseline by 33% compared with a 7% increase from baseline with exemestane. CONCLUSION: At 12 months, exemestane was associated with fewer hot flashes and less vaginal discharge than tamoxifen, but with more vaginal dryness, bone/muscle aches, and difficulty sleeping. Symptoms were common in both groups.",0
Indicators of lifetime estrogen exposure: effect on breast cancer incidence and interaction with raloxifene therapy in the multiple outcomes of raloxifene evaluation study participants.,"PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that risk factors related to lifetime estrogen exposure predict breast cancer incidence and to test if any subgroups experience enhanced benefit from raloxifene. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (N = 7,705), enrolled onto the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation (MORE) trial, were randomly assigned to receive placebo, raloxifene 60 mg/d, or raloxifene 120 mg/d for 4 years. Breast cancer risk was analyzed by the following baseline characteristics indicative of estrogen exposure: previous hormone replacement therapy, prevalent vertebral fractures, family history of breast cancer, estradiol level, bone mineral density (BMD), body mass index, and age at menopause. Therapy-by-subgroup interactions were assessed using a logistic regression model. RESULTS: Overall, women with the highest one-third estradiol levels (> or = 12 pmol/L) had a 2.07-fold increased invasive breast cancer risk compared with women with lower levels. Raloxifene significantly reduced breast cancer risk in both the low- and high-estrogen subgroups for all risk factors examined (P <.05 for each comparison). The women with the highest BMD and those with a family history of breast cancer experienced a significantly greater therapy benefit with raloxifene, compared with the two thirds of patients with lower BMD or those without a family history, respectively; the subgroup-by-therapy interactions were significant (P =.005 and P =.015, respectively). CONCLUSION: The MORE trial confirms that increased lifetime estrogen exposure increases breast cancer risk. Raloxifene therapy reduces breast cancer risk in postmenopausal osteoporotic women regardless of lifetime estrogen exposure, but the reduction is greater in those with higher lifetime exposure to estrogen.",0
Up-front tandem high-dose chemotherapy compared with standard chemotherapy with doxorubicin and paclitaxel in metastatic breast cancer: results of a randomized trial.,"PURPOSE: The role of high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) in metastatic breast cancer remains controversial. Trials with late intensification HDCT have failed to show an advantage in overall survival. This study was initiated to compare up-front tandem HDCT and standard combination therapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients without prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease were randomly assigned to standard combination therapy with doxorubicin and paclitaxel (AT) or double HDCT with cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, and etoposide followed by peripheral-blood stem-cell transplantation. HDCT was repeated after 6 weeks. Patients were stratified by menopausal and hormone-receptor status. The primary objective was to compare complete response (CR) rates. RESULTS: A total of 93 patients were enrolled onto the trial. Intent-to-treat CR rates for patients randomized to HDCT and AT were 12.5% and 11.1%, respectively (P = .84). Objective response rates were 66.7% for patients in the high-dose group and 64.4% for patients in the AT arm (P = .82). In an intent-to-treat analysis, there were no significant differences between the two treatments in median time to progression (HDCT, 11.1 months; AT, 10.6 months; P = .67), duration of response (HDCT, 13.9 months; AT, 14.3 months; P = .98), and overall survival (HDCT, 26.9 months; AT, 23.4 months; P = .60). HDCT was associated with significantly more myelosuppression, infection, diarrhea, stomatitis, and nausea and vomiting, whereas patients treated with AT developed more neurotoxicity. CONCLUSION: This trial failed to show a benefit for up-front tandem HDCT compared with standard combination therapy. HDCT was associated with more acute adverse effects.",1
"Cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil with and without doxorubicin in the adjuvant treatment of resectable breast cancer with one to three positive axillary nodes.","In the attempt to improve current adjuvant results in patients with one to three positive axillary lymph nodes, in November 1981 we activated a prospective randomized study to assess the effectiveness of intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) for 12 courses versus CMF for eight courses followed by Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Farmitalia Carlo Erba, Milan, Italy) for four courses. The 5-year results were evaluated in a total of 486 patients entered into the study up to December 1987. CMF chemotherapy was delivered IV for a total of 12 courses when given alone and for eight courses when followed by four courses of Adriamycin. All drugs were recycled every 3 weeks. Rather than temporarily reducing doses, drug administration was delayed for 1 to 2 weeks in the face of myelosuppression on the planned day of treatment. After a median follow-up of 61 months, no significant differences were evident between the treatment groups in terms of relapse-free (CMF 74% v CMF followed by Adriamycin 72%) and total survival (CMF 89% v CMF followed by Adriamycin 86%). Drug treatments were fairly well tolerated and devoid of life-threatening toxicity. Present results, which were not influenced by menopausal status, indicate that Adriamycin given after CMF failed to improve treatment outcome over CMF alone. However, the role of Adriamycin in an adjuvant setting remains to be further clarified. Considering the good 5-year results achieved in this study at the expense of minimal toxicity, full-dose CMF remains, at present, the adjuvant chemotherapy of choice for patients with one to three positive nodes.",1
Adverse outcome and resistance to adjuvant antiestrogen therapy in node-positive postmenopausal breast cancer patients-The role of p53.,"The prognostic and predictive relevance of p53 immunoreactivity is used here as a tentative approach for defining more accurately the benefit of adjuvant hormonal therapy in postmenopausal node-positive breast cancer patients. Ninety-seven postmenopausal patients with axillary lymph node metastasis were treated with an antiestrogen for a period of 3 years after primary surgery and radiotherapy. The p53 status of the primary tumor was assessed by immunohistochemistry and 24% of the samples showed positive expression of p53. Within the average follow-up time of 59 months, disease recurrence was diagnosed in 34 patients (35%). Multivariate analysis showed high clinical stage, negative estrogen receptor status and p53 positivity to be independent prognostic factors predicting both shortened disease-free survival and worse overall survival. p53 immunoreactivity was associated with worse clinical outcome irrespective of hormone receptor status. The data suggest that adjuvant therapy with antiestrogens is insufficient in this patient population with p53-positive tumors.",0
"Response to cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil in lymph node-positive breast cancer according to HER2 overexpression and other tumor biologic variables.","PURPOSE: There is considerable interest in biologic markers able to predict the response of cancer patients to therapy. HER2 overexpression is a potential indicator of responsiveness to doxorubicin and paclitaxel and of unresponsiveness to tamoxifen in breast carcinoma patients. However, the significance of HER2 overexpression in responsiveness to cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) has remained unclear. In this study, we investigated this issue in the 386 breast cancer patients in the first CMF controlled clinical trial with a 20-year follow-up. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Node-positive breast carcinoma patients were randomly assigned to receive either no further treatment after radical mastectomy (179 women) or 12 monthly cycles of adjuvant CMF chemotherapy (207 women). Overexpression of HER2 and the status of other tumor variables was assessed by immunohistochemistry in at least 324 (84%) of the 386 patients. Statistical analyses were performed to assess the efficacy of CMF treatment for the subgroups defined by HER2 and the status of other variables using a Bayesian approach. The end points considered were relapse-free survival (RFS) and cause-specific survival (CSS). RESULTS: Bayesian analysis of the treatment effect for HER2 and other variables indicated a clinical benefit from CMF treatment in all subgroups defined according to variables status. In particular regarding HER2 status, Bayesian estimates of RFS hazard ratios were equal to 0.484 and 0.641 and estimates of CSS hazard ratios were equal to 0.495 and 0.730 for HER2-positive and -negative tumors, respectively. CONCLUSION: CMF treatment showed a clinical benefit in the considered subgroups, defined according to HER2 and other tumor variables status. Patients with HER2-positive or HER2-negative tumors benefit from CMF treatment, and the poor prognosis associated with the HER2 overexpression in the untreated group could be completely overcome by the chemotherapy treatment.",0
"Sequential docetaxel as adjuvant chemotherapy for early breast cancer (TACT): an open-label, phase III, randomised controlled trial.","BACKGROUND: Incorporation of a taxane as adjuvant treatment for early breast cancer offers potential for further improvement of anthracycline-based treatment. The UK TACT study (CRUK01/001) investigated whether sequential docetaxel after anthracycline chemotherapy would improve patient outcome compared with standard chemotherapy of similar duration. METHODS: In this multicentre, open-label, phase III, randomised controlled trial, 4162 women (aged >18 years) with node-positive or high-risk node-negative operable early breast cancer were randomly assigned by computer-generated permuted block randomisation to receive FEC (fluorouracil 600 mg/m(2), epirubicin 60 mg/m(2), cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) at 3-weekly intervals) for four cycles followed by docetaxel (100 mg/m(2) at 3-weekly intervals) for four cycles (n=2073) or control (n=2089). For the control regimen, centres chose either FEC for eight cycles (n=1265) or epirubicin (100 mg/m(2) at 3-weekly intervals) for four cycles followed by CMF (cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2), methotrexate 40 mg/m(2), and fluorouracil 600 mg/m(2) at 4-weekly intervals) for four cycles (n=824). The primary endpoint was disease-free survival. Analysis was by intention to treat (ITT). This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN79718493. FINDINGS: All randomised patients were included in the ITT population. With a median follow-up of 62 months, disease-free survival events were seen in 517 of 2073 patients in the experimental group compared with 539 of 2089 controls (hazard ratio [HR] 0.95, 95% CI 0.85-1.08; p=0.44). 75.6% (95% CI 73.7-77.5) of patients in the experimental group and 74.3% (72.3-76.2) of controls were alive and disease-free at 5 years. The proportion of patients who reported any acute grade 3 or 4 adverse event was significantly greater in the experimental group than in the control group (p<0.0001); the most frequent events were neutropenia (937 events vs 797 events), leucopenia (507 vs 362), and lethargy (456 vs 272). INTERPRETATION: This study did not show any overall gain from the addition of docetaxel to standard anthracycline chemotherapy. Exploration of predictive biomarker-defined subgroups might have the potential to better target the use of taxane-based therapy.

A phase I dose escalation trial of gemcitabine with radiotherapy for breast cancer in the treatment of unresectable chest wall recurrences.,"The purpose of this study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of gemcitabine when given concurrently with standard radiotherapy for the treatment of chest wall recurrences, and to compare actuarial rates of local-regional control with those achieved in historical controls. Patients with unresectable chest wall recurrences were enrolled in a phase I trial of concurrent gemcitabine and radiotherapy. Gemcitabine was increased at 150 mg/m(2)/week increments, starting at 300 mg/m(2)/week. Radiotherapy was delivered to the chest wall and regional nodes to a total of 60 to 70 Gy in 2 Gy daily fractions. Treatment toxicity was assessed and a comparison of treatment outcome was performed between study patients and historical groups treated with either radiotherapy alone or excision followed by radiotherapy. The dose-limiting toxicities of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred at the second planned dose of 450 mg/m(2)/week after accrual of only six patients, resulting in a MTD of 300 mg/m(2)/week. Myelosuppression and skin desquamation were commonly observed. Actuarial rates of local-regional control were 100%, 50%, and 90% at 2 years for the gemcitabine with radiotherapy, radiotherapy alone, and excision followed by radiotherapy groups, respectively (p = 0.105). The difference among the Kaplan-Meier curves for overall local-regional control was statistically significant at p = 0.007 in favor of combined gemcitabine and radiotherapy. The MTD of gemcitabine is 300 mg/m(2)/week when gemcitabine is delivered concurrently with radiotherapy for unresectable chest wall failures. This novel approach suggests excellent local-regional control when compared to historical controls. A phase II trial is warranted.",1
Systemic therapy in node-negative patients: updated findings from NSABP clinical trials. National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project.,"This report updates findings from two National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) clinical trials conducted to evaluate the worth of systemic therapy for the treatment of node-negative breast cancer patients. In trial B-13, 737 women with estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors treated by sequential methotrexate and fluorouracil (MTX----5-FU) followed by leucovorin were compared with a control group treated by surgery alone. Findings for all patients through 5 years of follow-up indicate a 27% reduction in treatment failure as a result of MTX----5-FU (76% vs 67%). While patients 49 years old or less and 50 years old or more benefited significantly from MTX----5-FU, the effect on disease-free survival (DFS) was greatest in those 50 years or older, where a 50% reduction in treatment failure occurred (86% vs 72%). A 69% reduction in mortality resulting from MTX----5-FU was observed in the older group (95% vs 84%). Trial B-14 compared placebo with tamoxifen (TMX) in 2844 patients with ER-positive tumors. As originally reported, findings through 5 years of follow-up indicate a significant reduction (36%) in treatment failure as a result of the TMX (82% vs 72%). Improvement in DFS was highly significant in both age groups. In patients 49 years old or younger, there was a 44% reduction in DFS (81% vs 66%) and, in those 50 years old or more, a 31% reduction (82% vs 74%). A Cox proportional hazards model failed to indicate a benefit from MTX----5-FU and TMX in all patient subgroups. Both therapies reduced local-regional and distant recurrence, as well as breast tumor recurrence following lumpectomy. Updated findings from trials B-13 and B-14 continue to support our conclusions that (a) no subgroups of node-negative patients that we examined have such a good outcome as to preclude the use of effective systemic therapy in their treatment and (b) despite the benefits observed from MTX----5-FU and TMX, no subgroup of patients was so affected as to preclude use of a particular subgroup in assessing other therapy regimens in additional clinical trials. The identification and evaluation of markers to determine which patients should receive systemic therapy are of the highest priority. At present, however, the use of markers for therapeutic decision making regarding individual patients is tenuous.",1
Positive effect of tamoxifen as part of adjuvant chemo-endocrine therapy for breast cancer. Hokkaido Adjuvant Chemo-Endocrine Therapy for Breast Cancer Study Group.,"A prospective randomised multicentre clinical study was undertaken for 2 years and 3 months from November 1982, with the aim of examining the significance of using a combination of ftorafur (FT) and tamoxifen (TAM) for post-operative adjuvant therapy of breast cancer. Patients had either stage II or stage IIIa disease, were age 75 or below and had undergone radical mastectomy. Patients were divided into two groups and received one of the following treatment protocols: treatment A, intravenous administration of doxorubicin (DOX), 20 mg on the day of surgery and 10 mg the next day, followed by oral FT 50 mg day-1 for 2 years from the 14th day; treatment B, the same pattern of DOX administration for the first 2 days, followed by a combined therapy of FT and TAM 20 mg day-1 for 2 years. The number of patients was 546 (treatment A 274 and treatment B 272), of whom 34 (6%) were ineligible. The remaining 512 patients (treatment A 254 and treatment B 258) were followed up for 5 years for analysis. Significantly higher 5 year disease-free rate and 5 year survival rates were observed with treatment B compared with treatment A. When seen in terms of background factors, node-positive patients appeared to derive more benefit from tamoxifen than node-negative patients, but the oestrogen receptor-negative and premenopausal subgroups appeared to derive about the same benefit as those who were oestrogen receptor positive and post-menopausal. Indeed, survival in the premenopausal group was significantly better with tamoxifen (P = 0.04). No increase in side-effects was seen by combining TAM with FT. The study results demonstrate that concomitant administration of FT and TAM is better than FT alone for post-operative adjuvant therapy for breast cancer.",1
"A randomized, multicenter prospective trial assessing long-acting release octreotide pamoate plus tamoxifen as a first line therapy for advanced breast carcinoma.","BACKGROUND: Long-acting release octreotide pamoate (OP-LAR) is a synthetic octapeptide that can be administered monthly and whose activity is similar to that of endogenous somatostatin. In vitro and in vivo data suggest that OP-LAR may act as a growth inhibitor or a modulator of growth stimulatory peptides. The potential mechanisms of action of somatostatin analogues in breast carcinoma include the suppression of insulin-like growth factor-1 (a putative tumor growth factor) and the binding to the somatostatin receptors expressed by breast carcinoma cells in order to induce apoptosis. METHODS: This Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involved 203 patients (13% premenopausal and 87% postmenopausal) with locally recurrent (but unsuitable for local treatment) or metastatic breast carcinoma, 199 of whom were actually treated (99 patients with OP-LAR and 100 patients with placebo). All patients received TAM and were estrogen and/or progesteron receptor positive (receptor positivity was an eligibility criterion), and all had measurable or evaluable disease. Any patients who had received previous chemotherapy not given in an adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting were excluded. RESULTS: At the time of the interim analysis, the tumor response rates (RR) were 20.2% (9 complete responses [CR] and 11 partial responses [PR]) in the OP-LAR arm and 21% (11 CRs and 10 PRs) in the placebo arm, and the median time to progression (TTP) was 25.0 and 26.9 weeks (P = 0.62), respectively. The adverse events experienced by 10% or more of the patients and attributed to octreotide were gastrointestinal in nature: diarrhea (53%), nausea (16%), and abdominal pain (11%). CONCLUSIONS: Because of the similar RR and TTP in both arms, the trial was stopped at the interim analysis. The current data confirm there is no indication for adding somatostatin analogues to TAM in advanced breast carcinoma.",1
Elevated serum c-erbB-2 antigen levels and decreased response to hormone therapy of breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: Decisions concerning the use of hormone therapy to treat metastatic breast cancer are made on the basis of the presence of estrogen receptor (ER). Despite the presence of ER, half of patients will not respond to hormone treatment. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of overexpression of HER-2/neu on the response to hormone therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sera from 300 metastatic breast cancer patients with ER-positive (ER+), ER status unknown, or ER-/progesterone receptor-positive (PR+) randomized to receive second-line hormone therapy with either megestrol acetate or fadrozole were evaluated. An enzyme immunoassay (EIA) specific for the extracellular domain of the c-erbB-2 (HER-2/neu) oncogene product was used to detect serum levels. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients (19.3%) had elevated serum c-erbB-2 protein levels, using a selected cut-point of 30 U/mL. The response rate (complete responses [CRs] plus partial responses [PRs] plus stable disease [S]) to endocrine therapy was 40.9% in 242 patients with low serum c-erbB-2 levels and only 20.7% in 58 patients with elevated serum c-erbB-2 levels (P = .004). The median duration of treatment response was longer in the group with low serum c-erbB-2 levels (15.5 months) compared with the group with elevated serum c-erbB-2 levels (11.6 months). Survival was also significantly shorter in patients with elevated serum c-erbB-2 levels (P < .0001). CONCLUSION: Patients with ER+/c-erbB-2+ metastatic breast cancer are less likely to respond to hormone treatment than ER+/c-erbB-2- patients. Their survival duration is also shorter.",0
Randomized trial of adjuvant zoledronic acid in postmenopausal women with high-risk breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: We present the results of a randomized multicenter clinical trial of adjuvant zoledronic acid (ZA) in postmenopausal women with high-risk breast cancer. The primary objective was change in bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine and femoral neck at 1 year. Secondary objectives included change in calcaneal BMD, disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Postmenopausal women with stage II/III breast cancer diagnosed up to 5 years previous were eligible and randomized to either observation or ZA 4 mg intravenous every 3 months. Bone mineral density testing was performed at 0, 6, and 12 months.RESULTS: Sixty-eight women were enrolled (36 ZA and 32 observation). The population was a median of 2 years from diagnosis and the majority received tamoxifen during the study. There was a significant difference in the mean change from baseline to 1 year follow-up for lumbar spine (increased by 4.28% ± 0.62%; P = .01), total femur (increased by 1.9% ± 0.4%; P = .03), trochanter (increased by 2.97% ± 0.69%; P = .03), and calcaneal BMD (increased by 2% ± 0.57%; P = .01) in favor of the ZA arm. No significant difference in the mean change for the femoral neck was seen. No significant differences in DFS or OS were observed.CONCLUSION: Zoledronic acid significantly improved the BMD at multiple skeletal sites in postmenopausal women largely on tamoxifen. No new safety signals were noted. There were insufficient events to comment on DFS or OS.",0
Paclitaxel plus bevacizumab versus paclitaxel alone for metastatic breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: In an open-label, randomized, phase 3 trial, we compared the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel with that of paclitaxel plus bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor, as initial treatment for metastatic breast cancer. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients to receive 90 mg of paclitaxel per square meter of body-surface area on days 1, 8, and 15 every 4 weeks, either alone or with 10 mg of bevacizumab per kilogram of body weight on days 1 and 15. The primary end point was progression-free survival; overall survival was a secondary end point. RESULTS: From December 2001 through May 2004, a total of 722 patients were enrolled. Paclitaxel plus bevacizumab significantly prolonged progression-free survival as compared with paclitaxel alone (median, 11.8 vs. 5.9 months; hazard ratio for progression, 0.60; P<0.001) and increased the objective response rate (36.9% vs. 21.2%, P<0.001). The overall survival rate, however, was similar in the two groups (median, 26.7 vs. 25.2 months; hazard ratio, 0.88; P=0.16). Grade 3 or 4 hypertension (14.8% vs. 0.0%, P<0.001), proteinuria (3.6% vs. 0.0%, P<0.001), headache (2.2% vs. 0.0%, P=0.008), and cerebrovascular ischemia (1.9% vs. 0.0%, P=0.02) were more frequent in patients receiving paclitaxel plus bevacizumab. Infection was more common in patients receiving paclitaxel plus bevacizumab (9.3% vs. 2.9%, P<0.001), but febrile neutropenia was uncommon (<1% overall). CONCLUSIONS: Initial therapy of metastatic breast cancer with paclitaxel plus bevacizumab prolongs progression-free survival, but not overall survival, as compared with paclitaxel alone.

Adjuvant therapy of breast cancer: Southwest Oncology Group studies.,"The Southwest Oncology Group has conducted a series of randomized studies of adjuvant therapy in patients with primary breast cancer and positive axillary nodes. The first study, during which combined chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, vincristine, and prednisone (CMFVP) administered for 1 year was compared with single agent therapy with melphalan (L-PAM) for 2 years, was activated in 1975 and closed in 1978. Of the 366 patients who were eligible, 191 received L-PAM and 175 were given CMFVP. The 2 groups were comparable with regard to known prognostic factors. At a median follow-up of 8 years, CMFVP continues to be superior to L-PAM in disease-free (P = .005) and overall survival (P = .01). Thirty-five percent of patients on CMFVP have died compared with 46% on L-PAM. The greatest survival benefit is apparent in premenopausal women and women with 4 or more positive axillary nodes. Acute toxicity was more frequent with CMFVP than with L-PAM, but it was acceptable and reversible with both regimens. Long-term toxicity was limited to myeloproliferative disease in 2 patients on L-PAM and 1 on CMFVP. The second-generation series of studies, activated in 1979, were designed according to nodal status, estrogen receptor (ER) status, and menopausal status. We randomized ER-negative, node-negative patients to 6 months of combination chemotherapy or to no treatment. Because of slow accrual, the study was closed and patients are now being entered onto a similar intergroup study with the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group. We randomized ER-negative, node-positive patients to either 1 or 2 years of CMFVP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1
Long-term renal safety profile of ibandronate 6 mg infused over 15 minutes.,"BACKGROUND: In an earlier study, intravenous (i.v.) ibandronate 6 mg administered every 3-4 weeks had a similarly good renal safety profile whether infused over 15 or 60 min in women with breast cancer and bone metastases. This current study focuses on the renal safety of the extended use of ibandronate.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients completing the original study could choose to enter a follow-up phase and continue (or switch) to receive ibandronate 6 mg by 15-min i.v. infusion every 3-4 weeks. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with a serum creatinine increase of ≥44.2 mmol/l (= 0.5 mg/dl) from core baseline.RESULTS: Fourteen patients entered the follow-up phase and received a median of 16 infusions (range: 9-24). No patient reached the primary endpoint. Most adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity. None of the 6 reported treatment-related adverse events was considered severe or reported as a serious adverse event.CONCLUSIONS: Ibandronate was well tolerated when administered as a 6-mg i.v. infusion over 15 min every 3-4 weeks during the follow-up phase to the earlier core study. No evidence of any treatment-related deterioration in renal function was noted, and no new or unexpected adverse events occurred.",0

"Two different sides of 'chemobrain': determinants and nondeterminants of self-perceived cognitive dysfunction in a prospective, randomized, multicenter study.","OBJECTIVE: Complaints of cognitive dysfunction are frequent among cancer patients. Many studies have identified neuropsychological compromise associated with cancer and cancer therapy; however, the neuropsychological compromise was not related to self-reported cognitive dysfunction. In this prospective study, the authors examined if confounding factors masked an underlying association of self-perceived cognitive function with actual cognitive performance. Determinants of self-perceived cognitive dysfunction were investigated. METHODS: Self-perceived cognitive function and cognitive performance were assessed before treatment, at the end of treatment, and 1 year after baseline in 101 breast cancer patients randomized to standard versus intensified chemotherapy. Linear mixed-effects models were applied to test the relationships of performance on neuropsychological tests, patient characteristics, and treatment variables to self-reported cognitive function. Change of cognitive performance was tested as a predictor of change in self-reports. RESULTS: Self-perceived cognitive function deteriorated during chemotherapy and had partially recovered 1 year after diagnosis. The personality trait negative affectivity, current depression, and chemotherapy regimen were consistently related to cognitive self-reports. No significant associations with performance in any of the 12 cognitive tests emerged. Change of cognitive performance was not reflected in self-reports of cognitive function. CONCLUSIONS: Neuropsychological compromise and self-perceived cognitive dysfunction are independent phenomena in cancer patients. Generally, cancer-associated neuropsychological compromise is not noticed by affected patients, but negative affectivity and treatment burden induce pessimistic self-appraisals of cognitive functioning regardless of the presence of neuropsychological compromise. Clinicians should consider this when determining adequate therapy for patients who complain of 'chemobrain'.",0

Endocrine effects of adjuvant letrozole + triptorelin compared with tamoxifen + triptorelin in premenopausal patients with early breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: To compare the endocrine effects of 6 months of adjuvant treatment with letrozole + triptorelin or tamoxifen + triptorelin in premenopausal patients with early breast cancer within an ongoing phase 3 trial (Hormonal Adjuvant Treatment Bone Effects study). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospectively collected hormonal data were available for 81 premenopausal women, of whom 30 were assigned to receive tamoxifen + triptorelin and 51 were assigned letrozole + triptorelin +/- zoledronate. Serum 17-beta-estradiol (E2), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), Delta4-androstenedione, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate, progesterone, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and cortisol were measured at baseline and after 6 months of treatment. For each hormone, 6-month values were compared between treatment groups by the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney exact test. RESULTS: Median age was 44 years for both groups of patients. Letrozole + triptorelin (+/- zoledronate) induced a stronger suppression of median E2 serum levels (P = .0008), LH levels (P = .0005), and cortisol serum levels (P < .0001) compared with tamoxifen + triptorelin. Median FSH serum levels were suppressed in both groups, but such suppression was lower among patients receiving letrozole, who showed significantly higher median FSH serum levels (P < .0001). No significant differences were observed for testosterone, progesterone, ACTH, androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone between the two groups of patients. CONCLUSION: Letrozole in combination with triptorelin induces a more intense estrogen suppression than tamoxifen + triptorelin in premenopausal patients with early breast cancer.",0
Clinical study of adjuvant capecitabine monotherapy in Chinese elderly patients (aged 55-70) with stage IIa breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Oral capecitabine (CAP) has shown significant benefits in early stage breast cancer (BC). Herein we evaluated CAP as adjuvant monotherapy in women 55 years of age or older with stage IIa BC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women with stage IIa BC received 6 cycles of either CAP or CEF (cyclophosphamide/epirubicin/5-fluorouracil) after surgery. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Quality of life (QOL), patient acceptance of chemotherapy, and safety were secondary endpoints.RESULTS: A total of 71 women were enrolled. The 3- and 5-year OS rates were 96.97 and 93.33%, respectively in the CAP group versus 96.67 and 90.32%, respectively in the CEF group. The incidence of disease recurrence or metastasis was 6.67 versus 6.45%, respectively. All CAP patients completed the planned 6 cycles, while only 84% of CEF patients completed all 6 cycles. Myelosuppression, hepatic toxicity, and cardiovascular toxicity were more common with CEF, while hand-foot syndrome was more common with CAP. QOL was significantly better in the CAP group (p < 0.01). Compared with the CEF group, CAP patients had less moderate-to-severe mental disturbance (p < 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that CAP monotherapy is a potential alternative to CEF adjuvant chemotherapy in patients 55 years old or older with stage IIa BC.",1
Intent-to-treat analysis of the placebo-controlled trial of letrozole for extended adjuvant therapy in early breast cancer: NCIC CTG MA.17.,"BACKGROUND: MA.17 evaluated letrozole or placebo after 5 years of tamoxifen and showed significant improvement in disease-free survival (DFS) for letrozole [hazard ratio (HR) 0.57, P = 0.00008]. The trial was unblinded and placebo patients were offered letrozole.PATIENTS AND METHODS: An intent-to-treat analysis of all outcomes, before and after unblinding, on the basis of the original randomization was carried out.RESULTS: In all, 5187 patients were randomly allocated to the study at baseline and, at unblinding, 1579 (66%) of 2383 placebo patients accepted letrozole. At median follow-up of 64 months (range 16-95), 399 recurrences or contralateral breast cancers (CLBCs) (164 letrozole and 235 placebo) occurred. Four-year DFS was 94.3% (letrozole) and 91.4% (placebo) [HR 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55-0.83, P = 0.0001] and showed superiority for letrozole in both node-positive and -negative patients. Corresponding 4-year distant DFS was 96.3% and 94.9% (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.62-1.03, P = 0.082). Four-year overall survival was 95.1% for both groups. The annual rate of CLBC was 0.28% for letrozole and 0.46% for placebo patients (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.39-0.97, P = 0.033).CONCLUSIONS: Patients originally randomly assigned to receive letrozole within 3 months of stopping tamoxifen did better than placebo patients in DFS and CLBC, despite 66% of placebo patients taking letrozole after unblinding.",1
TP53 mutation and p53 overexpression for prediction of response to neoadjuvant treatment in breast cancer patients.,"The value of p53 to predict the cytotoxic effect of two commonly used chemotherapy regimens was assessed in patients with advanced breast cancer. Response to a DNA-damaging combination therapy [fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide (FEC] considered to induce p53-dependent apoptosis was compared with a microtubule stabilizing therapy (paclitaxel) expected to be independent of p53 function. The p53 status of the patients' breast tumors was assessed using both immunohistochemistry (IHC) and direct sequencing of the entire p53 gene. p53 findings were correlated with treatment response, and linkage between p53 function and cellular response was assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling assay. In a series of 67 breast tumors, 19% had TP53 gene mutations, 40% had a positive p53 IHC, and 12% had both. In the FEC group, treatment failure was related to both the presence of TP53 gene mutations (P = 0.0029) and a positive IHC (P < 0.0001). Apoptosis was almost exclusively found in tumors having normal p53 in both parameters (P < 0.0001). In the paclitaxel group, treatment response was neither related to apoptosis nor to normal p53. Combination of sequencing and IHC results revealed a significant association between abnormal p53 and response to paclitaxel (P = 0.011). We found TP53 mutations, as well as p53 protein overexpression, to be associated with response to chemotherapy. Whereas clinical response to FEC was found to be dependent on normal p53, the cytotoxicity of paclitaxel was related to defective p53. The efficiency of paclitaxel during mitosis might be supported by lack of G1 arrest due to p53 deficiency. Therefore, patients with p53-deficient tumors may benefit from paclitaxel.",0
The influence of tamoxifen in vivo on the main natural anticoagulants and fibrinolysis.,"The long-term effects of tamoxifen on alterations in haemostasis which could lead towards thrombosis were investigated in 149 women who were disease-free for at least 5 years following mastectomy for breast cancer. All participants were randomized to receive tamoxifen as a post-surgical adjuvant treatment (89 patients, treated group) or not (60 patients, controls) for at least 2 years. 5.62% of the cases treated with tamoxifen suffered a venous thrombosis, while no thromboembolism was reported in the control group. No significant differences were observed between groups in the global clotting times, fibrinogen, fibrinolytic factors, or in the concentration of the main natural anticoagulants, antithrombin III (AT-III), protein C(PC) and protein S (PS). However, when the treated group was sub-divided, current users (n = 18) of the drug (median treatment duration 72 months) had significantly lower AT-III (P < 0.05) and PC (P < 0.05) activities, together with higher levels of plasminogen activity (P < 0.01) and tissue plasminogen activator antigen (P < 0.01), compared with 71 ex-users (who mostly received treatment for 2 years) and controls. We conclude that long-term treatment with tamoxifen for 2 or more years tends to reduce both AT-III and PC, a situation possibly predisposing towards thrombosis. Monitoring haemostasis in tamoxifen-treated breast cancer patients is therefore advisable.",0

"Classical cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil chemotherapy is more effective in triple-negative, node-negative breast cancer: results from two randomized trials of adjuvant chemoendocrine therapy for node-negative breast cancer.","PURPOSE: Retrospective studies suggest that primary breast cancers lacking estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) and not overexpressing human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; triple-negative tumors) are particularly sensitive to DNA-damaging chemotherapy with alkylating agents.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients enrolled in International Breast Cancer Study Group Trials VIII and IX with node-negative, operable breast cancer and centrally assessed ER, PR, and HER2 were included (n = 2,257). The trials compared three or six courses of adjuvant classical cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) with or without endocrine therapy versus endocrine therapy alone. We explored patterns of recurrence by treatment according to three immunohistochemically defined tumor subtypes: triple negative, HER2 positive and endocrine receptor absent, and endocrine receptor present.RESULTS: Patients with triple-negative tumors (303 patients; 13%) were significantly more likely to have tumors > 2 cm and grade 3 compared with those in the HER2-positive, endocrine receptor-absent, and endocrine receptor-present subtypes. No clear chemotherapy benefit was observed in endocrine receptor-present disease (hazard ratio [HR], 0.90; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.11). A statistically significantly greater benefit for chemotherapy versus no chemotherapy was observed in triple-negative breast cancer (HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.73; interaction P = .009 v endocrine receptor-present disease). The magnitude of the chemotherapy effect was lower in HER2-positive endocrine receptor-absent disease (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.29 to 1.17; interaction P = .24 v endocrine receptor-present disease).CONCLUSION: The magnitude of benefit of CMF chemotherapy is largest in patients with triple-negative, node-negative breast cancer.",0
Is risk of central nervous system (CNS) relapse related to adjuvant taxane treatment in node-positive breast cancer? Results of the CNS substudy in the intergroup Phase III BIG 02-98 Trial.,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer central nervous system (CNS) metastases are an increasingly important problem because of high CNS relapse rates in patients treated with trastuzumab and/or taxanes.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated data from 2887 node-positive breast cancer patients randomised in the BIG 02-98 trial comparing anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy (control arms) to anthracycline-docetaxel-based sequential or concurrent chemotherapy (experimental arms). After a median follow-up of 5 years, 403 patients had died and detailed information on CNS relapse was collected for these patients.RESULTS: CNS relapse occurred in 4.0% of control patients and 3.7% of docetaxel-treated patients. CNS relapse occurred in 27% of deceased patients in both treatment groups. CNS relapse was usually accompanied by neurologic symptoms (90%), and 25% of patients with CNS relapse died without evidence of extra-CNS relapse. Only 20% of patients survived 1 year from the diagnosis of CNS relapse. Prognosis of CNS relapse was worse for patients with meningeal carcinomatosis when compared with brain metastases. Unexpected findings included a higher rate of positive cerebrospinal fluid cytology (8% versus 3%) and more frequent use of magnetic resonance imaging for diagnosis (47% versus 30%) in the docetaxel-treated patients.CONCLUSION: There is no evidence that adjuvant docetaxel treatment is associated with an increased frequency of CNS relapse.",0
Randomized trial of chemoendocrine therapy started before or after surgery for treatment of primary breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate in a randomized clinical trial systemic chemoendocrine therapy used as primary (neo-adjuvant) treatment before surgery in women with primary operable breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients aged less than 70 years with clinically palpable, primary operable breast cancer diagnostically confirmed by fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and suitable for treatment with surgery, radiotherapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and tamoxifen were considered eligible. Patients randomized to neoadjuvant treatment received four cycles of chemo-therapy for 3 months before surgery followed by another four cycles after surgery, and were compared with patients randomized to adjuvant therapy who received eight cycles of chemotherapy over 6 months after surgery. RESULTS: Of 212 patients who were randomized to receive either adjuvant (n = 107) or neoadjuvant (n = 105) chemoendocrine therapy, 200 are now assessable for response. The two groups are comparable for age, menopausal status, disease stage, and surgical requirements. The overall clinical response rate was 85%, with a complete histologic response rate of 10%. There was a significant reduction in the requirement for mastectomy in patients who received neoadjuvant treatment (13%) as compared with those who received adjuvant therapy (28%) (P < .005). Symptomatic and hematologic acute toxicity was low and similar for adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy. The median follow-up period for patients in this trial is 28 months, during which time four patients have relapsed locally and 20, including one of the local relapses, have developed metastatic disease, 19 of whom have died. The follow-up period is too brief to evaluate relapse rate or survival duration. CONCLUSION: This trial confirms previous reports of a high rate of response to neoadjuvant therapy, but is the first to include small primary cancers and to show, in the context of a randomized trial, a reduction in the requirement for mastectomy. Until disease-free and overall survival data are available from the larger National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP)-18 trial, such neoadjuvant treatment cannot be recommended outside of a clinical trial.",1
Dose-intensified epirubicin versus standard-dose epirubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by CMF in breast cancer patients with 10 or more positive lymph nodes: results of a randomised trial (GABG-IV E-93) - the German Adjuvant Breast Cancer Group.,"To compare dose-intensified epirubicin monotherapy with a standard sequential regimen, patients with primary breast cancer and > or =10 involved axillary nodes were randomised to either four 21-day cycles of epirubicin 120 mg/m(2) (E120; n=202) or four 21-day cycles of epirubicin 90 mg/m(2) plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) (EC) followed by three 28-day cycles of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF; n=209). Simultaneous hormonal treatment was applied in both arms. At 5 years' median follow-up, the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rates were 47.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 40.2-55.2%) for E120 and 45.9% (38.5-53.3%) for EC-CMF. E120 was as effective as EC-CMF with regard to EFS (hazard ratio [HR] for E120 versus EC-CMF 1.04; 95% CI, 0.79-1.36; p=0.79) and overall survival (HR 1.06; 95% CI 0.77-1.46; p=0.72). The data demonstrate that 4 cycles of dose-intensified epirubicin monotherapy can be as effective as 7 cycles of standard sequential polychemotherapy in high-risk breast cancer patients with > or =10 positive lymph nodes, despite treatment with a single agent and a shorter treatment duration.",1
Docetaxel in combination with mitoxantrone and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor as front-line chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer: a multicenter phase II study.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the activity and tolerance of docetaxel in combination with mitoxantrone and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) as front-line treatment in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-four previously untreated patients with MBC who had bidimensionally measurable disease were enrolled onto the study. Forty-eight (89%) patients had visceral metastases and nineteen (36%) had relapsed within twelve months following adjuvant chemotherapy. Docetaxel (100 mg/m2) was given on day 1 after appropriate premedication and mitoxantrone (20 mg/m2) on day 8. G-CSF (150 mcg/m2/d s.c.) was administered from day 2 to day 6 and from day 9 to day 15. The regimen was repeated every three weeks, on an outpatient basis. RESULTS: In an intention-to-treat analysis, 9 (17%) CRs, 24 (44%) PRs, (overall response rate 61%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 48.1%-74.1%), 12 (22%) SD and 9 (17%) PD were observed. The median duration of response and the median time to tumor progression was 12.5 and 14 months, respectively. The overall median survival was 16.5 months, whilst the probability for one- and three-year survival was 61% and 35%, respectively. Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in 37 (69%) patients, and febrile neutropenia in 16 (30%); there was one death due to sepsis. Grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia occurred in four (8%) patients. Grade 2-3 neurosensory toxicity was observed in 8 (15%) patients and grade 2-3 asthenia in 24 (45%). CONCLUSIONS: Docetaxel in combination with mitoxantrone and G-CSF support is an intensified and active front-line regimen for patients with MBC; despite its hematological toxicity, this regimen merits further comparison with other standard anthracycline- and/or taxane-based combinations.",1
Influence of definitive radiation therapy for primary breast cancer on ability to deliver adjuvant chemotherapy.,"Primary radiotherapy as a means of managing stage I and II breast cancer is receiving increasing attention. In a prospectively randomized trial comparing modified radical mastectomy to lumpectomy followed by definitive radiotherapy, we evaluated whether radiotherapy has a deleterious effect on the ability to administer adjuvant doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide to patients with histologically positive axillary lymph nodes. All patients were treated with an identical regimen, and doses were escalated to the same degree until myelosuppression occurred. There were no significant differences in the amount of chemotherapy administered to either treatment group. Patients in both groups received approximately 100% of the predicted dose of doxorubicin and approximately 117% of the predicted dose of cyclophosphamide. At present, we have no evidence that there are differences in recurrence rates as a function of the quantity of drug received, although longer follow-up is required.",0
"Postoperative chemo-endocrine treatment with mitomycin C, tamoxifen, and UFT is effective for patients with premenopausal estrogen receptor-positive stage II breast cancer. Nishinihon Cooperative Study Group of Adjuvant Therapy for Breast Cancer.","The effectiveness of combining mitomycin C (MMC), tamoxifen (TAM), and 1-(2-tetrahydrofuryl)-5-fluorouracil (tegafur) was evident in patients with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancers. UFT, an oral preparation of tegafur and uracil at a molar ratio of 1:4, was reported to have higher antitumor effects than tegafur alone for patients with breast cancer. Therefore, the combined chemotherapy of MMC, TAM and UFT may possibly be effective for breast cancer. From 1988 to 1991. we studied the effects of postoperative adjuvant therapy for Japanese women with stage 11 breast cancer, all seen at 71 institutions in western areas of Japan. Five hundred and ninety four patients with stage II primary breast cancer who had undergone curative surgery, including total mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection, were enrolled. On the day of surgery, each patient was given 13 mg/m2 of MMC intravenously. Patients with ER+ tumors were then assigned to group A or group B. Group A received 30 mg/day of TAM given orally from postoperative 2 weeks, for 2 years. Group B was additionally given an oral dose of 300 mg/day of UFT for 2 years, given concomitantly with 30 mg/day of TAM. Patients with ER- tumors were assigned to group C or group D. Group C were prescribed 300 mg/day of UFT, orally, from postoperative 2 weeks for 2 years, and group D were additionally given an oral dose of 30 mg/day of TAM together with 300 mg/day of UFT. There were no differences among the groups regarding prognostic factors or doses of MMC and TAM in ER+ patients and MMC and UFT in ER- patients. Toxicity rates for leukopenia, anorexia, and nausea/vomiting were higher in group B than in group A patients. There were no statistical differences in the overall survival and disease-free survival times between groups A and B, or groups C and D, for all eligible cases. In a retrospective subgroup analysis using Bonferroni's adjustments, the additional effect of UFT on the combined treatment of MMC and TAM lengthened the disease-free survival time for patients with premenopausal ER+ cancers (corrected P value by Bonferroni's adjustments <0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that effects of the combined treatment of MMC, TAM, and UFT was significantly related to the menopausal status (P<0.01). Our findings show that postoperative ingestion of MMC, TAM, and UFT was effective for patients with premenopausal ER+ stage II breast cancer.",1
Safety and efficacy results of a randomized trial comparing adjuvant toremifene and tamoxifen in postmenopausal patients with node-positive breast cancer. Finnish Breast Cancer Group.,"PURPOSE: In this multicenter trial, toremifene 40 mg/d was compared with tamoxifen 20 mg/d, both given orally for 3 years to postmenopausal, axillary node-positive women after breast surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The first 899 patients (toremifene, n = 459; tamoxifen, n = 440) of the total of 1,480 patients accrued to the trial were included in this scheduled safety analysis. The mean follow-up time was 3.4 years. RESULTS: The two treatment groups were well balanced with respect to patient and disease characteristics. The subjective side-effect profile was similar in both treatment groups. Slightly more vascular complications (deep vein thromboses, cerebrovascular events, and pulmonary embolisms) were seen among tamoxifen-treated patients (5.9%) as compared with toremifene-treated patients (3.5%) (P: =.11), whereas bone fractures (P: =.09) and vaginal leukorrhea (P: =.05) were more common in the toremifene group. The number of subsequent second cancers was similar. The breast cancer recurrence rate was 23.1% (n = 106) in the toremifene group and 26.1% (n = 115) in the tamoxifen group (P: =.31). When only patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive cancer were considered (n = 556), the risk for breast cancer recurrence was nonsignificantly lower among the toremifene-treated women, with a hazards ratio of 0.74 (90% confidence interval, 0.52 to 1.04; P: =.14). The mean time to breast cancer recurrence and overall survival were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: The side-effect profile of toremifene resembles that of tamoxifen. The efficacy of toremifene seems to be no less than that of tamoxifen. The trend for fewer breast cancer recurrences in the ER-positive subgroup is encouraging, but a longer follow-up is needed to confirm this.",1
Strain rate imaging detects early cardiac effects of pegylated liposomal Doxorubicin as adjuvant therapy in elderly patients with breast cancer.,"OBJECTIVE: Cardiac toxicity remains an important side effect of anthracyclines. New drug formulations (eg, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin [PL-DOX]) seem to be a successful strategy for reducing it. Changes in cardiac function induced by early chemotherapy, however, are subtle and difficult to quantitate by conventional imaging methods. Doppler myocardial imaging-based velocity, strain, and strain rate measurements have been shown to sensitively quantify abnormalities in cardiac function in other settings. DESIGN: We evaluated the feasibility and sensitivity of strain rate imaging compared with conventional echocardiography in detecting cardiac effects of PL-DOX therapy in elderly patients with cancer. In a pilot study, we examined 16 elderly women (age 69.8 +/- 3.1 years) with breast cancer receiving 6 cycles of PL-DOX. Conventional and Doppler myocardial imaging echocardiography were obtained at baseline and after 3 and 6 cycles of treatment. Segmental peak systolic longitudinal and radial velocity, strain, and strain rate were measured. RESULTS: Left ventricular dimensions, ejection fraction, and systolic myocardial velocity did not change throughout the follow-up. In contrast, a significant reduction in longitudinal and radial strain and strain rate was found after 6 cycles (longitudinal strain -18.8% +/- 2.8% vs -22.7% +/- 2.8%, P < .001 vs baseline and P = .001 vs after 3 cycles; radial strain 32.3% +/- 8.1% vs 50.1% +/- 11.6%, P < .001 vs baseline). Changes in radial function appeared earlier and were more pronounced than in longitudinal direction. CONCLUSION: In contrast with conventional echocardiography and myocardial velocity measurements, myocardial deformation parameters allowed detecting subtle changes in longitudinal and radial left ventricular function after 6 cycles of PL-DOX. We suggest that Doppler-based myocardial deformation imaging should be used for cardiac function monitoring during chemotherapy.",0
"First-line trastuzumab plus epirubicin and cyclophosphamide therapy in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive metastatic breast cancer: cardiac safety and efficacy data from the Herceptin, Cyclophosphamide, and Epirubicin (HERCULES) trial.","PURPOSE: A high incidence of congestive heart failure (CHF) has been observed in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) receiving doxorubicin-based chemotherapy and trastuzumab. The Herceptin, Cyclophosphamide, and Epirubicin (HERCULES) trial evaluated trastuzumab plus cyclophosphamide and the less cardiotoxic anthracycline epirubicin. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective trial combined a phase I dose-finding stage with a phase II randomized stage. In total, 120 patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -positive MBC and adequate cardiac function received first-line trastuzumab (4 mg/kg intravenous loading dose, then 2 mg/kg every week) plus cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m(2)) and either epirubicin 60 mg/m(2) (HEC-60) or 90 mg/m(2) (HEC-90) for six cycles, followed by trastuzumab monotherapy until progression. Sixty patients with HER2-negative disease received epirubicin (90 mg/m(2)) and cyclophosphamide (EC-90) alone. The primary end point was dose-limiting cardiotoxicity (DLC). RESULTS: Incidence of DLC was 5.0%, 1.7%, and 0% in the HEC-90, HEC-60, and EC-90 arms, respectively. All DLC events were manageable. There were no cardiac-related deaths. Other adverse-event profiles were comparable across the three arms, except febrile neutropenia, which was reported in 10% of the HEC-90 arm compared with 3% of the other arms. Tumor response rates were 57%, 60%, and 25% in the HEC-60, HEC-90, and EC-90 arms, respectively; median time to progression was 12.5, 10.1, and 7.6 months, respectively. CONCLUSION: The HEC regimen is a promising treatment option for patients with HER2-positive MBC. The lower incidence of DLC with HEC, compared with the historic incidence associated with trastuzumab plus doxorubicin, supports further evaluation of the regimen, especially in adjuvant or neoadjuvant settings.",1
A pilot study of the use of progressive muscle relaxation training in the management of post-chemotherapy nausea and vomiting.,"The aim of this pilot study was to assess the effectiveness of using progressive muscle relaxation training (PMRT) in the management of chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting in Chinese breast cancer patients receiving doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide as well as feasibility issues for a larger study. Eight patients were randomly assigned to receive either oral anti-emetics as per hospital protocol (maxolon) or adjuvant PMRT. Both groups, however, received intravenous anti-emetics half an hour before the chemotherapy administration. PMRT was given by a trained nurse once a day for 5 days. A repeated measures design was used. Nausea and vomiting were assessed with the Morrow Nausea and Vomiting Scale. Results indicated that the duration and intensity of nausea were lower in the experimental group, although the former was at a borderline level of significance. The duration and intensity of vomiting were also lower in the experimental group. Delayed nausea and vomiting was observed in both groups. Despite the small sample size, the study showed that PMRT is an effective adjuvant method to decrease nausea and vomiting in chemotherapy patients. This has implications for nursing practice, as it is a low-cost and easy-to-leam technique that can be incorporated in the care planning of patients receiving chemotherapy.",0
A randomized clinical trial evaluating tamoxifen in the treatment of patients with node-negative breast cancer who have estrogen-receptor-positive tumors.,"We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of postoperative therapy with tamoxifen (10 mg twice a day) in 2644 patients with breast cancer, histologically negative axillary nodes, and estrogen-receptor-positive (greater than or equal to 10 fmol) tumors. No survival advantage was observed during four years of follow-up (92 percent for placebo vs. 93 percent for tamoxifen; P = 0.3). There was a significant prolongation of disease-free survival among women treated with tamoxifen, as compared with those receiving placebo (83 percent vs. 77 percent; P less than 0.00001). This advantage was observed in both the patients less than or equal to 49 years old (P = 0.0005) and those greater than or equal to 50 (P = 0.0008), particularly in the former, among whom the rate of treatment failure was reduced by 44 percent. Multivariate analysis indicated that all subgroups of patients benefited. Tamoxifen significantly reduced the rate of treatment failure at local and distant sites, tumors in the opposite breast, and the incidence of tumor recurrence after lumpectomy and breast irradiation. The benefit was attained with a low incidence of clinically appreciable toxic effects. The magnitude of the improvement obtained does not preclude the need for future trials in which patients given tamoxifen could serve as the control group in an evaluation of potentially better therapies. Tamoxifen treatment is justified in patients who meet the eligibility criteria of the present study and who refuse to participate in those trials. Since patients with tumors too small for conventional analysis of estrogen-receptor and progesterone-receptor concentrations were not eligible for this study, no information is available to indicate that such patients should receive tamoxifen.",1
Five years of letrozole compared with tamoxifen as initial adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal women with endocrine-responsive early breast cancer: update of study BIG 1-98.,"PURPOSE: Previous analyses of the Breast International Group (BIG) 1-98 four-arm study compared initial therapy with letrozole or tamoxifen including patients randomly assigned to sequential treatment whose information was censored at the time of therapy change. Because this presentation may unduly reflect early events, the present analysis is limited to patients randomly assigned to the continuous therapy arms and includes protocol-defined updated results. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four thousand nine hundred twenty-two of the 8,028 postmenopausal women with receptor-positive early breast cancer randomly assigned (double-blind) to the BIG 1-98 trial were assigned to 5 years of continuous adjuvant therapy with either letrozole or tamoxifen; the remainder of women were assigned to receive the agents in sequence. Disease-free survival (DFS) was the primary end point. RESULTS: At a median follow-up time of 51 months, we observed 352 DFS events among 2,463 women receiving letrozole and 418 events among 2,459 women receiving tamoxifen. This reflected an 18% reduction in the risk of an event (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.95; P = .007). No predefined subsets showed differential benefit. Adverse events were similar to previous reports. Patients on tamoxifen experienced more thromboembolic events, endometrial pathology, hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal bleeding. Patients on letrozole experienced more bone fractures, arthralgia, low-grade hypercholesterolemia, and cardiovascular events other than ischemia and cardiac failure. CONCLUSION: The present updated analysis, which was limited to patients on monotherapy arms in BIG 1-98, yields results similar to those from the previous primary analysis but more directly comparable with results from other trials of continuous therapy using a single endocrine agent.",1
"Tamoxifen versus control after adjuvant, risk-adapted chemotherapy in postmenopausal, receptor-negative patients with breast cancer: a randomized trial (GABG-IV D-93)--the German Adjuvant Breast Cancer Group.","PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of adjuvant sequential tamoxifen after chemotherapy in postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-negative breast cancer. METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to oral tamoxifen (30 mg daily for 5 years; n = 421) or no additional treatment (n = 408) after risk-adapted polychemotherapy consisting of three 28-day cycles of CMF (cyclophosphamide, 500 mg/m(2), methotrexate, 40 mg/m(2), and fluorouracil, 600 mg/m(2)) in patients with negative or one to three positive lymph nodes and four 21-day cycles of epirubicin 90 mg/m(2), cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) followed by three cycles of CMF in patients with four to nine positive lymph nodes. RESULTS: Thirty-six percent of the patients included were older than 60 years, 63% were node negative, 13% had four to nine positive nodes, 55% had tumor grade 3, and 41% received breast-preserving surgery. At 5.3 years' median follow-up, the first event of failure (recurrence, secondary tumor, or death) had occurred in 123 patients in the tamoxifen group and 107 patients of the control group. Event-free survival rates after 5 years were 70.3% (95% CI, 65.5% to 75.0%) and 72.8% (95% CI, 68.2% to 77.5%) for the tamoxifen and control groups, respectively. The estimated hazard ratio of tamoxifen versus control was 1.13 (95% CI, 0.87 to 1.48; P = .34), which gives no indication of an additional benefit of tamoxifen in these patients. CONCLUSION: This study contributes substantially to finalization of the presently emerging evidence that tamoxifen does not benefit women with receptor-negative breast cancer after chemotherapy.",1
"Adjuvant tamoxifen in the management of operable breast cancer: the Scottish Trial. Report from the Breast Cancer Trials Committee, Scottish Cancer Trials Office (MRC), Edinburgh.","In a trial that began in 1978, 1312 evaluable patients under 80 years of age who either had negative axillary nodes or were postmenopausal with positive axillary nodes were randomised to receive adjuvant tamoxifen 20 mg daily for 5 years, or tamoxifen for the treatment of first relapse. Estimates of oestrogen receptor (ER) content of primary tumour specimens were made in 57%. There has been a highly significant delay in relapse in the adjuvant arm of the trial. This benefit supersedes that from tamoxifen given as treatment for recurrent disease in control-arm patients (93% received this) so that benefit from adjuvant tamoxifen was maintained in the overall survival comparisons. This improvement seems to be independent of nodal and menopausal status. It does not differ significantly with ER level, although the greatest benefit in disease-free survival is in patients with levels of 100 fmol/mg protein or more.",1
Behavioral therapy intervention trial to improve sleep quality and cancer-related fatigue.,"BACKGROUND: To determine whether sleep quality and fatigue associated with breast cancer adjuvant chemotherapy treatments can be improved with behavioral therapy (BT) [Individualized Sleep Promotion Plan (ISPP)] including modified stimulus control, modified sleep restriction, relaxation therapy, and sleep hygiene. METHODS: Randomized-controlled trial based on Piper Integrated Fatigue Model, 219 stages I-IIIA breast cancer patients. Prior to the initial chemotherapy treatment, BT participants developed an ISPP plan that was regularly reinforced and revised. Controls received healthy eating information and attention. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), daily diary, actigraph, and Piper Fatigue Scale (PFS) data were collected 2 days prior, during the 7 days after each treatment, and 30 days after the last treatment. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used. RESULTS: Prior to chemotherapy, participants reported mild fatigue and fairly poor sleep quality. All variables changed over time. A group by time interaction was found for sleep quality (PSQI) improving in the BT group. Diary revealed group differences on number of awakenings, minutes awake after sleep onset, and sleep efficiency. Fatigue (PFS) was similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: The BT group showed improved sleep quality over time and better sleep (diary). Perceptions of improved sleep quality over time are not consistently associated with diary or actigraph, or result in lower fatigue.",0
Dose-tailoring of FEC adjuvant chemotherapy based on leukopenia is feasible and well tolerated. Toxicity and dose intensity in the Scandinavian Breast Group phase 3 adjuvant Trial SBG 2000-1.,"UNLABELLED: The SBG 2000-1 trial is a randomised study that investigates if dose-tailored adjuvant FEC therapy based on the individual's leukocyte nadir value can improve outcome. The study has included 1535 women with medium and high-risk breast cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: After a first standard dosed FEC course (5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m(2), epirubicin 60 mg/mg(2) and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2)), patients who did not reach leukopenia grade III or IV were randomised to standard doses (group standard) or doses tailored to achieve grade III leukopenia (group tailored) at courses 2-7. Patients who achieved leukopenia grade III or more after the first course were not randomised but continued on standard doses (group registered).RESULTS: Both planned and actually delivered number of courses (seven) were the same in all three arms. The relative dose intensity was increased by a factor of 1.31 (E 1.22, C 1.43) for patients in the tailored arm compared to the expected on standard dose. Ninety percent of the patients in the tailored arm achieved leukopenia grade III-IV compared with 29% among patients randomised to standard dosed therapy. Dose tailoring was associated with acceptable acute non-haematological toxicity with more total alopecia, nausea, vomiting and fatigue.CONCLUSION: Dose tailoring according to leukopenia was feasible. It led to an increased dose intensity and was associated with acceptable excess of acute non-haematological toxicity.",0
"Genetic variants of CYP3A5, CYP2D6, SULT1A1, UGT2B15 and tamoxifen response in postmenopausal patients with breast cancer.","INTRODUCTION: Tamoxifen therapy reduces the risk of recurrence and prolongs the survival of oestrogen-receptor-positive patients with breast cancer. Even if most patients benefit from tamoxifen, many breast tumours either fail to respond or become resistant. Because tamoxifen is extensively metabolised by polymorphic enzymes, one proposed mechanism underlying the resistance is altered metabolism. In the present study we investigated the prognostic and/or predictive value of functional polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 3A5 CYP3A5 (*3), CYP2D6 (*4), sulphotransferase 1A1 (SULT1A1; *2) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B15 (UGT2B15; *2) in tamoxifen-treated patients with breast cancer. METHODS: In all, 677 tamoxifen-treated postmenopausal patients with breast cancer, of whom 238 were randomised to either 2 or 5 years of tamoxifen, were genotyped by using PCR with restriction fragment length polymorphism or PCR with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The prognostic evaluation performed in the total population revealed a significantly better disease-free survival in patients homozygous for CYP2D6*4. For CYP3A5, SULT1A1 and UGT2B15 no prognostic significance was observed. In the randomised group we found that for CYP3A5, homozygous carriers of the *3 allele tended to have an increased risk of recurrence when treated for 2 years with tamoxifen, although this was not statistically significant (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.68 to 11.99, P = 0.15). In the group randomised to 5 years' tamoxifen the survival pattern shifted towards a significantly improved recurrence-free survival (RFS) among CYP3A5*3-homozygous patients (HR = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.07 to 0.55, P = 0.002). No reliable differences could be seen between treatment duration and the genotypes of CYP2D6, SULT1A1 or UGT2B15. The significantly improved RFS with prolonged tamoxifen treatment in CYP3A5*3 homozygotes was also seen in a multivariate Cox model (HR = 0.13, CI = 0.02 to 0.86, P = 0.03), whereas no differences could be seen for CYP2D6, SULT1A1 and UGT2B15. CONCLUSION: The metabolism of tamoxifen is complex and the mechanisms responsible for the resistance are unlikely to be explained by a single polymorphism; instead it is a combination of several mechanisms. However, the present data suggest that genetic variation in CYP3A5 may predict response to tamoxifen therapy.",0
Neoadjuvant docetaxel in breast cancer: 3-year survival results from the Aberdeen trial.,"Over the past 30 years there has been an increased use of neoadjuvant (or primary) chemotherapy for treating patients with breast cancer. However, while it is clear that chemotherapy given in the adjuvant setting after surgery does prolong patients' overall and disease-free survival, the evidence that chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting also increases survival remains unproven. In the Aberdeen study, 162 patients with large and locally advanced breast cancer underwent 4 cycles of CVAP (cyclophosphamide/vincristine/doxorubicin/prednisone) primary chemotherapy. Patients with a complete or partial response were then randomized to either 4 further cycles of CVAP or 4 cycles of docetaxel (100 mg/m2). It was shown that the addition of sequential docetaxel (100 mg/m2) to CVAP neoadjuvant chemotherapy resulted in a significantly enhanced clinical response rate (94% vs. 64%) and a substantially increased complete histopathological response rate (34% vs. 16%) when compared to patients receiving CVAP alone. Furthermore, patients receiving docetaxel had an increased breast conservation rate (67% vs. 48%) and an increased survival at a median follow-up of 3 years. It is important to note that this was a small study, and the survival results should be interpreted with caution. The results are encouraging, however, and further studies are urgently required.",1
"The GISS trial: a phase II prevention trial of screening plus goserelin, ibandronate, versus screening alone in premenopausal women at increased risk of breast cancer.","BACKGROUND: Genetic testing for inherited mutations in breast cancer genes provides valuable information for disease prevention. Today, premenopausal women with increased risk for breast cancer have only limited nonsurgical options to reduce their risk. METHODS: The GISS trial, a randomized, multicenter, open-label phase II trial, assessed the feasibility of a preventive treatment with goserelin and ibandronate for premenopausal women at increased risk for breast cancer. The primary endpoints were refusal to undergo randomization and discontinuation of treatment. Safety and quality of life were also evaluated. RESULTS: Between the years 2001 and 2003, 31 of 322 eligible women participated in the trial; 15 received goserelin/ibandronate plus screening, 15 screening only, and 1 withdrew her consent after randomization. The treatment duration was 24 months. Here, mainly the results from the first 12 months were evaluated because of the low compliance thereafter. Hot flushes, headache, and vaginal dryness/discharge occurred more often in the goserelin arm. No difference was observed between the two arms in the agreement to randomization, compliance, or any other endpoints. CONCLUSIONS: Acceptance of chemoprevention with goserelin and ibandronate was low. Premenopausal women at increased risk for breast cancer should be better informed about chemoprevention through physician counseling and a more feasible study design (e.g., oral medication) should be provided. IMPACT: This is the first chemoprevention trial in premenopausal women at increased risk for breast cancer.",0
Effect of preoperative chemotherapy on local-regional disease in women with operable breast cancer: findings from National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-18.,"PURPOSE: To determine whether preoperative doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) permits more lumpectomies to be performed and decreases the incidence of positive nodes in women with primary breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women (n = 1,523) were randomized to National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-18; 759 eligible patients received postoperative AC and 747, preoperative AC. The clinical size of breast and axillary tumors was determined before each of four cycles of AC and before surgery. Tumor response to preoperative therapy was clinically complete (cCR), partial (cPR), stable (cSD), or progressive disease (cPD). Tissue from patients with a cCR was evaluated for a pathologic complete response (pCR). RESULTS: Breast tumor size was reduced in 80% of patients after preoperative therapy; 36% had a cCR. Tumor size and clinical nodal status were independent predictors of cCR. Twenty-six percent of women with a cCR had a pCR. Clinical nodal response occurred in 89% of node-positive patients: 73% had a cCR and 44% of those had a pCR. There was a 37% increase in the incidence of pathologically negative nodes. Before randomization, lumpectomy was proposed for 86% of women with tumors < or = 2 cm, 70% with tumors 2.1 to 5.0 cm, and 3% with tumors > or = 5.1 cm. Clinical tumor size and nodal status influenced the physician's decision. Overall, 12% more lumpectomies were performed in the preoperative group; in women with tumors > or = 5.1 cm, there was a 175% increase. CONCLUSION: Preoperative therapy reduced the size of most breast tumors and decreased the incidence of positive nodes. The greatest increase in lumpectomy after preoperative therapy occurred in women with tumors > or = 5 cm, since women with tumors less than 5 cm were already lumpectomy candidates. Preoperative therapy should be considered for the initial management of breast tumors judged too large for lumpectomy.",0
Risk of new primaries after chemotherapy and/or tamoxifen treatment for early breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Both chemotherapy and tamoxifen are widely used either alone or in combination as adjuvant treatment following mastectomy. Despite the fact that both of them exhibit carcinogenic properties in experimental models, detailed reports on the incidence of new primaries following chemotherapy and/or tamoxifen in patients with early breast cancer are limited. PURPOSE: To investigate the incidence of new primaries (including opposite breast tumors and skin cancers) in untreated patients and in patients treated with either tamoxifen or chemotherapy or with both modalities. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 1696 patients with early breast cancer, 1286 of whom were treated with either CMF-based adjuvant chemotherapy (n = 410), tamoxifen (n = 656) or with a combination of the two (n = 220) were considered for the present analysis. Patients were operated on between November 1983 and December 1991 and were followed up to June 1994. Detailed information about second malignancies were available for all patients. RESULTS: Overall, 53 new primaries, 19 of them opposite breast tumors, occurred in 53 patients. The actuarial cumulative incidence rates at 5 years were: 3.1% (95% CI: 1.4%-4.8%) in untreated patients; 1.7% (95% CI: 0.0%-3.5%) in tamoxifen-treated patients; 4.2% (95% CI: 1.3%-7.1%) in chemotherapy-treated patients and 2.6% (95% CI: 0.0%-5.2%) in the chemo-tamoxifen group (all groups: P = n.s.; chemotherapy-treated versus tamoxifen-treated: P = 0.01). The corresponding figures, after exclusion of the patients with opposite-breast and skin tumors, were: untreated patients: 2% (95% CI: 0.6%-3.4%); tamoxifen-treated patients: 0.95% (95% CI: 0.0%-2.4%); chemotherapy-treated patients: 2.6% (95% CI: 0.4%-4.8%); chemotherapy plus tamoxifen: 1.65% (95% CI: 0.4%-3.8%); (all groups: P = n.s.; CT versus TAM P = 0.05). Chemotherapy-treated patients showed a risk that was about two-fold that of the one to be expected in the general population. By contrast, a decrease in the total risk was observed in patients treated with tamoxifen. Patients who received chemotherapy and tamoxifen as well as those in the no-treatment group showed a risk which was comparable to that of the general population. CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant chemotherapy appears to increase the risk of second malignancies. By contrast, tamoxifen seems to exert an overall protective effect in this regard, and it also appears to counteract, at least partially, the carcinogenic effect of chemotherapy. IMPLICATIONS: While there is plenty of evidence that the benefit achieved by adjuvant chemotherapy considerably exceeds the risk of second malignancies, the indiscriminate use of chemotherapy should be avoided, particularly in patients with a low risk of relapse. Moreover, it seems reasonable to prefer tamoxifen over chemotherapy for patients likely to obtain comparable therapeutic benefit from antiestrogenic treatment.",0
Prognostic Impact of [18F] FDG-PET in operable breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of serial [(18)F] 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D: -glucose-positron emission tomography ([(18)F] FDG-PET) in potentially operable breast cancer with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS: Serial positron emission tomography was undertaken in 66 breast cancer patients who comprised a subset of the population in a phase III randomized neoadjuvant trial at National Cancer Center, Korea. We assessed the peak standardized uptake value (SUVp) in the primary tumor and axillary nodes before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and calculated the reduction rate (RR) of the SUVp. By means of a receiver operating characteristic curve, we identified an optimal cutoff value for the RR for predicting the pathologic response and evaluated the prognostic power of this cutoff value. RESULTS: Ten patients (15.2%) experienced a pathologic complete response (pCR) in the primary tumor, and 19 patients (28.8%) experienced a pCR in the axillary nodes. The mean RR of the SUVp in primary tumors was 70.3% +/- 28.7%, and this value was significantly different by the pathological response (89.2% +/- 11.1% in pCR vs. 66.9% +/- 29.6% in non-pCR, P < .001). When 84.8% of the RR was used as a cutoff value for the pCR, sensitivity and specificity was 70.0% and 69.6%, respectively. Ten patients (15.2%) developed recurrent disease at a median follow-up period of 61.5 (range, 13.5-71.8) months. In a univariate analysis, the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was correlated with the clinical T stage (91.1% in T1/2 vs. 71.4% in T3/4, P = .02), HER-2 status (77.8% in positive vs. 96.9% in negative, P = .03), and the 84.8% RR of the SUVp in the primary tumor (95.8% vs. 78.5%, P = .04). HER-2 positivity was a significant independent prognosticator in the multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 8.73, 95% confidence interval 1.03-73.84, P = .04). The presence of a pCR in the primary tumor or nodes was not a prognostic factor in this subset of patients. The RR of the SUVp in the axillary nodes was not correlated with the nodal pCR and DFS. CONCLUSIONS: The RR of the SUVp in the primary tumor was correlated with the pathologic response and DFS. This study suggests the possible prognostic value of the RR in positron emission tomography by neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",0
Safety of tibolone in the treatment of vasomotor symptoms in breast cancer patients--design and baseline data 'LIBERATE' trial.,"Many patients with a history of breast cancer (BC) will suffer from vasomotor symptoms, which can be induced or exacerbated by treatment with tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors. The LIBERATE trial was designed as a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial to demonstrate that tibolone 2.5mg/day (Livial) is non-inferior to placebo regarding BC recurrence in women with vasomotor symptoms surgically treated for primary BC within the last 5 years. Secondary objectives are effects on vasomotor symptoms as well as overall survival, bone mineral density and health-related quality of life. Mean age at randomization was 52.6 years, and the mean time since surgery was 2.1 years. The mean daily number of hot flushes and sweating episodes was 7.3 and 6.1, respectively. For the primary tumor, Stage IIA or higher was reported for >70% of the patients. In subjects whose receptor status was known, 78.2% of the tumors were estrogen receptors positive. At randomization, tamoxifen was given to 66.2% of all patients and aromatase inhibitors to 7%. Chemotherapy was reported by 5% at randomization. The adjuvant tamoxifen use in LIBERATE allows a comparison with the Stockholm trial (showing no risk of BC recurrence associated with hormone therapy), which was stopped prematurely subsequent to HABITS. The LIBERATE trial is the largest, ongoing, well-controlled study for treatment of vasomotor symptoms in BC patients.",0
"Postoperative adjuvant randomised trial comparing chemoendocrine therapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy for patients with stage II breast cancer: 5-year results from the Nishinihon Cooperative Study Group of Adjuvant Chemoendocrine Therapy for Breast Cancer (ACETBC) of Japan.","Between 1985 and 1988, the effect of using ftorafur (FT) or PSK (an immunotherapy agent) in combination with the conventional postoperative adjuvant therapy using mitomycin (MMC) plus tamoxifen (TAM) was assessed in stage II, oestrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer patients. Furthermore, in ER- breast cancer stage II patients, the effects of postoperative adjuvant therapy using MMC plus FT were compared with the effects of postoperative adjuvant therapy using MMC plus PSK. Patients had primary stage II breast cancer and had undergone total mastectomy plus axillary dissection or more radical surgery. On the day of surgery, MMC (13 mg/m2) was administered intravenously. Then, ER+ patients received one of three regimens of drug therapy, starting 2 weeks after surgery: regimen A (daily oral treatment with 30 mg of TAM), regimen B (daily oral treatment with 30 mg of TAM and 600 mg of FT) or regimen C (daily oral treatment with 30 mg of TAM and 3 g of PSK) [corrected]. ER- patients received either regimen D (daily oral treatment with 600 mg of FT) or regimen E (daily oral treatment with 3 g of PSK), starting 2 weeks after surgery. Of the 540 ER+ patients registered, 525 were evaluated. The 5-year overall survival rate for ER+ patients was higher for patients who received regimen B (94.2%) than for those who received regimen A (86.9%) or regimen C (89.9%) (P = 0.063). The 5-year relapse-free survival rate was higher for regimen B (88.9%) than for regimen A (78.6%) and regimen C (77.2%) (P = 0.010). Stratified analysis revealed better results with the FT-combined therapy in patients positive for lymph node metastasis and premenopausal patients. These results indicate the effectiveness of using FT in combination with TAM. Of the 376 ER- patients registered, 364 were evaluated. The 5-year overall and relapse-free survival rate for ER- patients did not differ significantly between patients who received regimen D and those who received regimen E.",1
Tamoxifen down-regulates CaMKII messenger RNA levels in normal human breast tissue.,"Tamoxifen was proven to reduce the incidence of breast cancer by 49% in women at increased risk of the disease in the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial. In order to identify potential candidates to explain the preventive effect induced by tamoxifen on breast cancer, normal breast tissue obtained from 42 fibroadenoma patients, randomly assigned to receive placebo or tamoxifen, was analyzed by the reverse Northern blot and RT-PCR techniques. The cDNA fragments used on Northern blot membranes were generated by the Human Cancer Genome Project funded by the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research and FAPESP (Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, Brazil). Total RNA was obtained from normal breast tissue from patients with clinical, cytological and ultrasound diagnosis of fibroadenoma. After a 50-day treatment with tamoxifen (10 or 20 mg/day) or placebo, normal breast tissue adjacent to the tumor was collected during lumpectomy with local anesthesia. One differentially expressed gene, Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), was found to be down-regulated during TAM treatment. CaMKII is an ubiquitous serine/threonine protein kinase that has been implicated in the diverse effects of hormones utilizing Ca2+ as a second messenger as well as in c-fos activation. These results indicate that the down-regulation of CaMKII induced by TAM might represent alternative or additional mechanisms of the action of this drug on cell cycle control and response to hormones in normal human breast tissue.",0
Acustimulation wrist bands are not effective for the control of chemotherapy-induced nausea in women with breast cancer.,"This experiment examined the efficacy of an acustimulation wrist band for the relief of chemotherapy-induced nausea using a randomized three-arm clinical trial (active acustimulation, sham acustimulation, and no acustimulation) in 96 women with breast cancer who experienced nausea at their first chemotherapy treatment. Five outcomes related to wrist band efficacy (acute nausea, delayed nausea, vomiting, QOL, and total amount of antiemetic medication used) were examined. The five outcomes were examined separately using analysis of covariance controlling for age and severity of past nausea. There were no significant differences in any of these study measures among the three treatment conditions (P>0.1 for all). Study results do not support the hypothesis that acustimulation bands are efficacious as an adjunct to pharmacological antiemetics for control of chemotherapy-related nausea in female breast cancer patients.",0
"Genetic variants in COX-2, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and breast cancer risk: the Western New York Exposures and Breast Cancer (WEB) Study.","Chronic inflammation has been consistently associated with cancers of several sites, including the breast, and inhibition of inflammation through the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been inversely associated with risk. As NSAIDs bind with cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), genetic variation in COX-2 may influence breast cancer risk by affecting inflammatory response and response to NSAID use. We identified eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for COX-2 and examined their association with risk of breast cancer in a population-based case-control study in Western New York. Cases had incident, first primary, histologically confirmed breast cancer (n = 1077). Controls (n = 1910) were randomly selected from NY Department of Motor Vehicles records (< 65) or Medicare rolls (≥ 65). Participants were queried on adult lifetime use of aspirin and recent use of ibuprofen. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). One SNP, rs2745559, was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.03-1.46). Associations with other variants were not evident. Significant interaction (P interaction = 0.04) between recent aspirin use and rs4648261 was also observed. Variation in COX-2 was modestly associated with breast cancer risk, indicating that COX-2 may play a role in breast carcinogenesis. Better understanding of the role of COX-2 genetic variation and interaction with NSAID use in breast carcinogenesis has potential to inform prevention strategies.",0
"Influence of dexaminoglutethimide, an optical isomer of aminoglutethimide, on the disposition of estrone sulfate in postmenopausal breast cancer patients.","Aminoglutethimide (AG) has been the most widely used aromatase inhibitor in breast cancer patients to date. Commercially, AG (Orimeten) is available as a racemate (DL-AG). Previous studies suggested the stereoisomers of AG (D-AG and L-AG) to differ considerably in their affinities and potencies to inhibit different cytochrome P-450-dependent enzymes, with D-AG being the potent aromatase inhibitor. DL-AG, apart from being an aromatase inhibitor, is known to enhance the metabolism of plasma estrone sulfate (E1S). In the present study we compared the effects of D-AG (500 mg daily) and DL-AG (1000 mg daily) on plasma estrogen levels and estrone (E1) and E1S clearance rates, determined after the injection of [14C]E1 and [3H]E1S, in a cross-over study involving 12 postmenopausal breast cancer patients. Treatment with DL-AG and D-AG suppressed plasma E1S to 18.6% and 15.0% of pretreatment levels, whereas E1 and estradiol E2 levels fell to 18.6% and 23.4% of their pretreatment levels during treatment with DL-AG and to 17.7% and 23.4% during treatment with D-AG, respectively. Thus, both treatment options suppressed all estrogens measured to a similar extent. The clearance rate of E1S increased from a mean pretreatment value of 5.9 to 14.0 and 10.0 L/h during treatment with DL-AG and D-AG, respectively (P < 0.05, comparing the two on-treatment situations), whereas the production rate of E1S decreased from a pretreatment value of 1.44 to 0.64 nmol/h with DL-AG and 0.36 nmol/h with D-AG (P < 0.05, comparing on-treatment values). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the D- as well as the L-form of AG may enhance the clearance rate of E1S. The finding of a higher estrogen production rate during treatment with DL-AG compared to D-AG probably reflects an increased plasma level of the estrogen precursor androstenedione (mean levels of androstenedione of 2.54 and 1.27 nmol/L during treatment with D-AG and DL-AG, respectively; P < 0.05).",0
Course of fatigue in women receiving chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy for early stage breast cancer.,"Although much has been learned about the complication of fatigue during breast cancer treatment, the possibility that there are differences across treatment modalities in breast cancer patients' experience of fatigue has not yet been established. In this study, fatigue was assessed in 134 women receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy or radiotherapy only for early stage breast cancer. Comparisons of fatigue during initial treatment indicated that women who received chemotherapy reported greater fatigue severity and disruptiveness than women receiving radiotherapy. Women not pre-treated with chemotherapy experienced increased fatigue over the course of radiotherapy. Results confirmed predictions that fatigue in women with early stage breast cancer differs as a function of the type of treatment and sequencing of treatment. Findings indicating increases in fatigue during radiotherapy only among women not pretreated with chemotherapy suggest a response shift, or a change in internal standards, in women's perceptions of fatigue as a function of prior chemotherapy treatment.",0
"Oral uracil and tegafur compared with classic cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil as postoperative chemotherapy in patients with node-negative, high-risk breast cancer: National Surgical Adjuvant Study for Breast Cancer 01 Trial.","PURPOSE: The primary aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of oral uracil-tegafur (UFT) with that of classical cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) given as postoperative adjuvant treatment to women with node-negative, high-risk breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women with node-negative, high-risk breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive either 2 years of UFT or six cycles of CMF after surgery. The primary end point was relapse-free survival (RFS). Overall survival (OS), toxicity, and quality of life (QOL) were secondary end points. The hypothesis was that UFT was not inferior to CMF in terms of RFS. RESULTS: Between October 1996 and April 2001, a total of 733 patients were randomly assigned to receive either treatment. The median follow-up time was 6.2 years. The RFS rates at 5 years were 88.0% in the CMF arm and 87.8% in the UFT arm. OS rates were 96.0% and 96.2%, respectively. The hazard ratios of the UFT arm relative to the CMF arm were 0.98 for RFS (95% CI, 0.66 to 1.45; P = .92) and 0.81 for OS (95% CI, 0.44 to 1.48; P = .49). The toxicity profiles differed between the two groups. The QOL scores were better for patients given UFT than those given CMF. CONCLUSION: RFS and OS with oral UFT were similar to those with classical CMF. Given the higher QOL scores, oral UFT is a promising alternative to CMF for postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy in women with node-negative, high-risk breast cancer.",1
Cisplatin plus oral etoposide (EoP) combination is more effective than paclitaxel in patients with advanced breast cancer pretreated with anthracyclines: a randomised phase III trial of Turkish Oncology Group.,"Our objective was to determine whether oral etoposide and cisplatin combination (EoP) is superior to paclitaxel in the treatment of advanced breast cancer (ABC) patients pretreated with anthracyclines. From December 1997 to August 2003, 201 patients were randomised, 100 to EoP and 101 to paclitaxel arms. Four patients in each arm were ineligible. The doses of etoposide and cisplatin were 50 mg p.o. twice a day for 7 days and 70 mg m(-2) intravenously (i.v.) on day 1, respectively, and it was 175 mg m(-2) on day 1 for paclitaxel. Both treatments were repeated every 3 weeks. A median of four cycles of study treatment was given in both arms. The response rate obtained in the EoP arm was significantly higher (36.3 vs 22.2%; P=0.038). Median response duration was longer for the EoP arm (7 vs 4 months) (P=0.132). Also, time to progression was significantly in favour of the EoP arm (5.5 vs 3.9 months; P=0.003). Median overall survival was again significantly longer in the EoP arm (14 vs 9.5 months; P=0.039). Toxicity profile of both groups was similar. Two patients in each arm were lost due to febrile neutropenia. The observed activity and acceptable toxicity of EoP endorses the employment of this combination in the treatment of ABC following anthracyclines.",1
Filgrastim and lack of support of intensive adjuvant chemotherapy for high-risk breast cancer patients.,"The capacity of filgrastim to reduce the myelotoxicity of a 16-week intensive chemotherapy regimen has been investigated in 24 operable breast cancer patients with > or = 10 metastatic axillary nodes. Five patients were treated with chemotherapy alone (control group); 19 patients were treated with chemotherapy and filgrastim, 5 microg/kg/day s.c. Six patients in the latter group were treated from day 4 to day 7 (level 1), seven from day 10 to day 13 (level 2), and six from day 4 to day 7 and day 10 to day 13 (level 3). A total of 135 courses were administered: neutropenia was the most severe toxicity, and the prophylactic use of filgrastim does not reduce its severity. Moreover, the dose intensities of antiblastic drugs actually received by the patients were not significantly different in the four study groups. Among the patients treated at level 3, there were three toxic deaths: one patient died because of febrile neutropenia and sepsis, two patients because of ischemic colitis. At a median follow-up of 15 months, 17 patients were alive, and 15 patients were disease free. The use of filgrastim does not ameliorate myelotoxicity and does not allow the administration of the planned doses of antiblastic drugs of a 16-week intensive chemotherapy regimen.",0
A randomized trial comparing mitoxantrone with doxorubicin in patients with stage IV breast cancer.,"Mitoxantrone (Novantrone; dihydroxyanthracenedione) is an anthraquinone previously shown to be active in human breast cancer. It appears to have less toxicity than doxorubicin. Results of this phase II-III randomized cross-over trial to determine the relative efficacy and toxicity of mitoxantrone in comparison to doxorubicin, are presented. Patients with measurable, recurrent breast cancer with limited prior chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy for metastatic disease, and who had not been exposed to prior doxorubicin, were randomized to receive either mitoxantrone or doxorubicin every three weeks with cross-over on progression. Response rates, duration of remission, time to treatment failure, and drug toxicity, including cardiac toxicity evaluated with serial radionuclide angiocardiography, were evaluated. Differences in the response rates for the two groups were not statistically significant. Neither time to treatment failure nor duration of response are significantly different (p greater than 0.05). With respect to toxicity, mitoxantrone treated patients consistently exhibited a lower incidence and less severe drug toxicity as compared to their doxorubicin-treated counterparts. Cardiac toxicity was carefully monitored and thus four patients on doxorubicin have had drug related congestive heart failure, as compared to none on mitoxantrone. In summary, mitoxantrone appears to be as active as doxorubicin in patients with stage IV breast cancer previously treated with chemotherapy; however, mitoxantrone causes significantly less nausea, vomiting, stomatitis and alopecia at doses which induce equal or greater myelosuppression than doxorubicin, and appears to be less cardiotoxic.",1
Detailed analysis of a randomized phase III trial: can the tolerability of capecitabine plus docetaxel be improved without compromising its survival advantage?,"BACKGROUND: In a phase III trial, 3-weekly capecitabine (1250 mg/m(2) twice daily days 1-14) plus docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) day 1) demonstrated significantly superior overall survival to 3-weekly docetaxel (100 mg/m(2) day 1). We report a retrospective analysis of the impact of capecitabine/docetaxel dose reduction on safety and efficacy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Safety and efficacy data were analyzed retrospectively according to the actual doses of capecitabine and docetaxel administered. RESULTS: More patients receiving capecitabine/docetaxel (65%) had dose reductions for adverse events than docetaxel alone (35%). In most patients requiring dose reduction with the combination (80%), capecitabine and docetaxel were simultaneously reduced to 950 mg/m(2) and 55 mg/m(2), respectively. Subsequently, there were fewer cycles (17%) with grade 3/4 adverse events than with the full doses (34%). Time to progression and overall survival appeared to be similar in patients starting the second cycle with reduced doses of capecitabine/docetaxel and those who continued to receive full doses of capecitabine/docetaxel for at least the first four cycles. CONCLUSIONS: Capecitabine/docetaxel dosing flexibility allows management of side-effects without compromising efficacy. This retrospective analysis, as well as multiple phase II studies of taxanes with reduced-dose capecitabine, shows that reducing the starting dose of capecitabine with docetaxel is a reasonable strategy for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer. In addition, reducing the dose of both agents may be appropriate.",0
Very low-dose adjuvant chemotherapy in steroid receptor negative stage I breast cancer patients. Austrian Breast Cancer Study Group.,"A randomised clinical trial was performed to test whether or not low-dose chemotherapy lasting only 35 days improves the outcome of breast cancer patients with stage I disease and negative oestrogen and progesterone receptors (ER-, PgR-). Between 1984 and 1990, 277 stage I breast cancer patients with tumours negative for both oestrogen and progesterone receptors were randomised to receive either low-dose short-term chemotherapy or no chemotherapy. Chemotherapy consisted of one cycle of doxorubicin, vincristin (AV) and one cycle of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil (CMF). Patients were stratified for tumour stage, type of surgery, menopausal status and participating centre. Results were analysed both by univariate and multivariate statistical. After a median length of follow-up of 84 months, disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS) did not differ significantly between patients having received adjuvant chemotherapy and the control group. Uni- and multivariate analysis did not show any significant prognostic or therapy related factor. A low-dose short-term adjuvant chemotherapy is insufficient to improve the prognosis of patients with breast cancer stage I with ER-, PgR-tumours.",1
Patients' preferences for adjuvant chemotherapy in early breast cancer: what makes AC and CMF worthwhile now?,"BACKGROUND: Studies of women who had adjuvant chemotherapy for early breast cancer 10-20 years ago showed that many judged small benefits sufficient to make it worthwhile. Indications, regimens and supportive care have changed. We sought the preferences of contemporary women who received similar chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-seven consecutive consenting women who completed adjuvant chemotherapy for early breast cancer 3-34 months previously were interviewed. Preferences were elicited with a structured, scripted interview using the trade-off method. Women were presented with four hypothetical scenarios based on known life expectancies (5 and 15 years) and survival rates (65% and 85% at 5 years) without adjuvant chemotherapy. RESULTS: Improvements of an additional year in life expectancy or 3% in survival rates were judged sufficient to make adjuvant chemotherapy worthwhile by 68-84% of women. Half the women judged 1 day or 0.1% sufficient to make adjuvant chemotherapy worthwhile. Recollections of better well-being during adjuvant chemotherapy, having dependants and having a friend or relative who died from cancer were independently associated with judging smaller benefits sufficient to make adjuvant chemotherapy worthwhile (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Preferences were highly variable, but the benefits judged sufficient to make adjuvant chemotherapy worthwhile were even smaller than those found in previous studies. Preferences were influenced by factors other than direct benefits and harms of chemotherapy.",0
"Effects of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells (regramostim), Escherichia coli (molgramostim) and yeast (sargramostim) on priming peripheral blood progenitor cells for use with autologous bone marrow after high-dose chemotherapy.","Peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) were collected without prior association with chemotherapy but after the administration of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-GM, regramostim), Escherichia coli (E. coli-GM, molgramostim), or yeast (Yeast-GM, sargramostim) and used in conjunction with autologous bone marrow after high-dose chemotherapy in 69 patients with breast cancer or melanoma. The mean peripheral white blood cell (WBC) counts increased by 2.2 to 2.7-fold after regramostim, 4.5 to 7.3-fold after molgramostim and 4.3-fold after sargramostim. All patients underwent three leukaphereses. The mean (+/- standard error) total nucleated pheresed cells per kg x 10(8) were 4.15 +/- 0.56, 15.10 +/- 1.77 and 7.24 +/- 1.00 for patients receiving regramostim, molgramostim or sargramostim respectively. The mean (+/- standard error) granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units per kg x 10(4) mobilized into the PB were 8.75 +/- 3.63, 71.03 +/- 17.85, and 65.11 +/- 18.74 for patients receiving regramostim, molgramostim, or sargramostim respectively. The total mean (+/- standard error) CD34+ cells per kg x 10(7) collected by three leukaphereses were 3.28 +/- 1.62, 1.34 +/- 0.51 and 2.57 +/- 1.93, for patients receiving regramostim, molgramostim or sargramostim respectively. The use of either molgramostim- or sargramostim-primed PBPCs led to complete elimination of absolute leukopenia with a WBC count under 100/mm3 in 64% and 77% of patients treated, respectively. Patients receiving molgramostim-primed PBPCs required fewer red blood cells transfusions than patients receiving regramostim-primed PBPCs (p = 0.0062). Our data indicate that PBPCs collected without prior association with chemotherapy but after either molgramostim or sargramostim with autologous bone marrow support and GM-CSF shorten the hematopoietic recovery after myeloablative chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer or melanoma.",0
Patterns of treatment failure--implications for new treatment approaches.,,0
Randomized trial comparing protracted infusion of 5-fluorouracil with weekly doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide with a monthly bolus FAC regimen in metastatic breast carcinoma (SPM90).,"Infusional 5-fluorouracil in advanced breast cancer has been associated with improved clinical response rates when compared with conventional bolus therapy. As a first line of chemotherapy in proven metastatic breast carcinoma, 258 women were randomly assigned to receive FAC consisting of 5-fluorouracil (F) 600 mg m(-2) intravenously (i.v.) over 1 h on days 1, 2 and 3, doxorubicin (A) 50 mg m(-2) i.v. bolus on day 1 and cyclophosphamide (C), 400 mg m(-2) i.v. bolus on days 1, 2 and 3 or 'FULON' consisting of 5-fluorouracil 250 mg m(-2) day(-1) continuously infused from day 1 to day 22, doxorubicin 15 mg m(-2) i.v. bolus on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 and cyclophosphamide 300 mg m(-2) i.v. bolus on days 1, 8, 15 and 22. Chemotherapy courses were administered 4-weekly for the bolus regimen and 6-weekly for FULON. Pretreatment characteristics were identical between the two groups. Response rates were 54% in the FAC arm and 53% in the FULON arm. Time to progression was 14 months in the FAC arm and 12 months in the FULON arm. Differences were not statistically significant. Median overall survival duration for all patients was 22 months. Haematological toxicity was more severe in the bolus-treated group (P = 0.05), as were nausea and vomiting (P < or = 0.01). We conclude that the two regimens appeared equally effective but have different toxicities.",1
Variation in the FGFR2 gene and the effects of postmenopausal hormone therapy on invasive breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer concern is a major reason for the recent marked reduction in use of postmenopausal hormone therapy, although equally effective means of controlling menopausal symptoms are lacking. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene are substantially associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk and could influence hormone therapy effects.PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: We interrogated eight SNPs in intron 2 of the FGFR2 gene for 2,166 invasive breast cancer cases from the Women's Health Initiative clinical trial and one-to-one matched controls to confirm an association with breast cancer risk. We used case-only analyses to examine the dependence of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen-alone odds ratios on SNP genotype.RESULTS: Seven FGFR2 SNPs, including six in a single linkage disequilibrium region, were found to associate strongly (P < 10(-7)) with breast cancer risk. SNP rs3750817 (minor allele T with frequency 0.39) had an estimated per-minor-allele odds ratio of 0.78, and was not in such strong linkage disequilibrium with the other SNPs. The genotype of this SNP related significantly (P < 0.05) to hormone therapy odds ratios. For estrogen plus progestin, the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) at 0, 1, and 2 minor SNP alleles were 1.52 (1.14-2.02), 1.33 (1.01-1.75), and 0.69 (0.41-1.17), whereas the corresponding values for estrogen alone were 0.74 (0.51-1.09), 0.99 (0.68-1.44), and 0.34 (0.15-0.76).CONCLUSIONS: Postmenopausal women having TT genotype for SNP rs3750817 have a reduced breast cancer risk and seem to experience comparatively favorable effects of postmenopausal hormone therapy.",0

A randomized trial of two doses of cyclophosphamide with etoposide and G-CSF for mobilization of peripheral blood stem cells in 318 patients with stage II-III breast cancer.,"The purpose of this study was to develop a less toxic outpatient chemotherapy regimen for mobilizing peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC). Three hundred eighteen patients with newly diagnosed stage II-III breast cancer who had received conventional dose adjuvant chemotherapy were randomized to receive intermediate-dose cyclophosphamide (2 g/m2), etoposide (600 mg/m2), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) 6 micrograms/kg/day (ID-Cy, n = 162) or high-dose cyclophosphamide (4 g/m2) and the same doses of etoposide and G-CSF (HD-Cy, n = 156) followed by collection of PBSC. Three hundred seventeen of 318 patients had apheresis performed, and 315 received high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) followed by PBSC support. The median numbers of CD34+ cells collected in a median of two apheresis following ID-Cy and HD-Cy were 19.9 and 22.2 x 10(6)/kg, respectively (p = 0.04). The fractions of patients achieving CD34+ cell doses > or = 2.5 or > or = 5.0 x 10(6)/kg were not different between the two regimens. More patients receiving HD-Cy had grade 3-4 nausea (p = 0.001), vomiting (p = 0.03), and mucositis (p = 0.04). The fractions of patients having a neutrophil nadir < 0.5 x 10(9)/L following ID-Cy and HD-Cy were 0.83 and 0.95, respectively (p = < 0.001). The fractions of patients having a platelet nadir < 25 x 10(9)/L following ID-Cy and HD-Cy were 0.13 and 0.51, respectively (p = < 0.001). More patients in the HD-Cy group received platelet (p < 0.001) and red blood cell (p < 0.001) transfusions and were admitted to the hospital more frequently (p = 0.03) than patients receiving ID-Cy. Three hundred fifteen patients received HDC followed by infusion of PBSC. There were no significant differences in the incidence of transplant-related death or early survival between patients receiving ID-Cy or HD-Cy followed by HDC. It was concluded that a regimen of Cy 2 g/m2 with etoposide and G-CSF was effective for mobilization of PBSC with low morbidity and resource utilization in patients with limited prior chemotherapy exposure.",1
"A randomized trial in postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer comparing endocrine and cytotoxic therapy given sequentially or in combination. The Australian and New Zealand Breast Cancer Trials Group, Clinical Oncological Society of Australia.","A prospective randomized clinical trial was performed in 339 postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer. Two single modality treatment sequences, doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide (AC) followed on failure by tamoxifen (TAM), and TAM followed by AC, were compared with combined modality chemo-endocrine therapy (TAM plus AC). The response rate to initial TAM (22.1%) was inferior to that for AC (45.1%), and for TAM plus AC (51.3%). However, patients randomized to the sequence TAM followed by AC showed a 42.5% overall tumor response to sequential protocol therapy, similar to the 46.9% for those randomized to AC followed by TAM. Furthermore, survival in all three arms was almost identical. Adverse prognostic factors for survival were liver metastases, short disease-free interval, poor performance status, and prior adjuvant chemotherapy. In no subgroup was significantly better survival associated with initial cytotoxic therapy. Endocrine therapy followed on failure by cytotoxics is appropriate for postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer.",1
Serum HER-2/neu and response to the aromatase inhibitor letrozole versus tamoxifen.,"PURPOSE: To determine the effect of elevated serum HER-2/neu on the response of metastatic breast cancer patients to an aromatase inhibitor versus an antiestrogen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five hundred sixty-two estrogen receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer patients were randomized to first-line hormone therapy with either letrozole or tamoxifen. An automated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect serum HER-2/neu. RESULTS: For patients with normal serum HER-2/neu (70.5%), objective response rate (ORR; 39% in letrozole-treated patients v 26% in tamoxifen-treated patients; P =.008), clinical benefit (CB; 57% v 45%; P =.016), time to progression (TTP; median, 12.2 v 8.5 months; P =.0019), and time to treatment failure (TTF; median, 11.6 v 6.2 months; P =.0066) were significantly better in patients treated with letrozole. In the elevated HER-2/neu group (29.5%), there was no significant difference in ORR (17% in letrozole-treated patients v 13% in tamoxifen-treated patients; P =.45) or CB (33% v 26%; P =.31), but there was a strong trend in favor of a longer TTP with letrozole (median, 6.1 v 3.3 months; P =.0596) and a significantly longer TTF with letrozole (median, 6.0 v 3.2 months; P =.0418). Multivariate analysis revealed that elevated serum HER-2/neu was a negative predictor for ORR and TTP. CONCLUSION: Patients with normal serum HER-2/neu receiving letrozole demonstrated a significantly greater ORR and CB and longer TTP and TTF than patients receiving tamoxifen. Although in patients with elevated serum HER-2/neu there was no significant difference between letrozole and tamoxifen in ORR or CB, there was a strong trend favoring longer TTP and significantly longer TTF with letrozole.",1
"Short-course FAC-M versus 1 year of CMFVP in node-positive, hormone receptor-negative breast cancer: an intergroup study.","PURPOSE: To compare 1 year of therapy with continuous cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil (5-FU), vincristine, and prednisone (CMFVP) with a short course of treatment with a doxorubicin-based regimen in the postsurgical adjuvant treatment of patients with hormone receptor-negative, node-positive breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five-hundred thirty-one eligible women with hormone receptor-negative, node-positive breast cancer were randomized to receive either 1 year of therapy with CMFVP or 20 weeks of therapy with four 5-week courses of treatment with 5-FU, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and methotrexate (FAC-M). RESULTS: At a median follow-up time of 4.9 years, the two treatment arms cannot be demonstrated to be different with respect to overall survival (stratified log-rank, P = .27). The 5-year survival rate is 64% on the CMFVP arm and 61% on the FAC-M arm. CMFVP produces marginally superior disease-free survival (P = .06). The estimated 5-year disease-free survival rate is 55% for patients treated with CMFVP as opposed to 50% for patients treated with FAC-M. CONCLUSION: Neither regimen was shown to be superior in terms of overall survival. Because the disease-free survival produced by CMFVP is marginally superior to that produced by FAC-M, we do not recommend FAC-M for further investigation or for routine use. Possible implications of this study are discussed in the context of other adjuvant chemotherapy trials.",1
Pamidronate in the treatment of bone metastases: results of 2 dose-ranging trials in patients with breast or prostate cancer.,"Four intravenous regimens of pamidronate (Aredia) were evaluated for palliative treatment of bone metastases in 2 randomized open-label trials in patients with breast cancer (n = 61) or prostate cancer (n = 58). In breast cancer patients, administration of pamidronate 60 mg every 4 weeks, 60 mg every 2 weeks, or 90 mg every 4 weeks for 3 months resulted in statistically and clinically significant reductions in bone pain, with accompanying decreases in biochemical markers of bone turnover; a regimen of 30 mg every 2 weeks was not effective. Healing of bone lesions was observed in 25% of breast cancer patients. In prostate cancer patients, the same regimens of pamidronate produced reductions in bone pain, but no dose-response relationship was apparent. Moreover, there were no consistent changes in biochemical indices in these patients, and no healing of bone lesions occurred. The different response to pamidronate in those 2 patient populations may reflect the different severity of metastatic disease at baseline. Side effects of pamidronate were mild and transient in both studies.",0
Poor outcome of patients with resectable breast cancer receiving adjuvant high-dose sequential chemotherapy following preoperative treatment.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The prognosis of resectable high risk breast cancer (BC) patients (N+ > 10) is poor with a five-year disease-free survival (DFS) after standard adjuvant ADM/CMF chemotherapy (CT) of about 40%. An improvement in survival has been reported when high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support is given. It has been recently suggested that nodal status and the degree of pathological remission following preoperative CT administered in patients harbouring tumors larger than 3 cm represent the most important prognostic factors for DFS. Since no data are available regarding the impact of primary CT in the high dose CT adjuvant setting, we retrospectively evaluated the efficacy of administering megadoses of cytotoxic drugs with stem cell support in the subgroup of patients showing poor response to preoperative CT., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fourteen women with high risk BC, N+ > 10 and tumor size > 3 cm following antracyclin-based primary CT, received high dose sequential chemotherapy (HDS). The median number of positive axillary nodes at surgery was 18 and tumor size was greater than 5 cm in 6 patients. HDS chemotherapy consisted of cyclophosphamide (7 gr/m2), methotrexate (8 gr/m2) plus vincristin (2 mg), 2 courses of carboplatin (360 mg/m2), and Thiotepa (600 mg/m2) plus L-PAM (160 mg/m2) as final myeloablative regimen requiring stem cell support. RESULTS: At a minimum follow up of 12 months (median 18 months, range 12-40) 5 patients remained disease free (36%) and 9 (64%) have relapsed (7 within the first 10 months). CONCLUSION: Our retrospective analysis suggests that BC patients showing poor response to primary CT might fail to achieve the benefits expected from high dose intensification.",0
Adjuvant letrozole versus tamoxifen according to centrally-assessed ERBB2 status for postmenopausal women with endocrine-responsive early breast cancer: supplementary results from the BIG 1-98 randomised trial.,"BACKGROUND: The Breast International Group (BIG) 1-98 trial (a randomised double-blind phase III trial) has shown that letrozole significantly improves disease-free survival (DFS) compared with tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with endocrine-responsive early breast cancer. Our aim was to establish whether the benefit of letrozole versus tamoxifen differs according to the ERBB2 status of tumours. METHODS: The BIG 1-98 trial consists of four treatment groups that compare 5 years of monotherapy with letrozole or tamoxifen, and sequential administration of one drug for 2 years followed by the other drug for 3 years. Our study includes data from the 4922 patients randomly assigned to the two monotherapy treatment groups (letrozole or tamoxifen for 5 years; 51 months median follow-up [range <1 to 90 months]). A central assessment of oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR) and ERBB2 status using paraffin-embedded primary tumour material was possible for 3650 (74%) patients. ER, PgR, and ERBB2 expression were measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and ERBB2-positivity was confirmed by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH). Positive staining in at least 1% of cells was considered to show presence of ER or PgR expression. Tumours were deemed ERBB2-positive if amplified by FISH, or, for the few tumours with unassessable or unavailable FISH results, if they were IHC 3+. Hazard ratios (HR) estimated by Cox modelling were used to compare letrozole with tamoxifen for DFS, which was the primary endpoint, and to assess treatment-by-covariate interactions. The BIG 1-98 trial is registered on the clinical trials site of the US National Cancer Institute website http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT00004205. FINDINGS: By central assessment 7% (257 of 3650) of tumours were classified as ERBB2-positive. In 3533 patients with tumours confirmed to express ER, DFS was poorer in patients with ERBB2-positive tumours (n=239) than in those with ERBB2-negative tumours (n=3294; HR 2.09 [95% CI 1.59-2.76]; p<0.0001). There was no statistical evidence of heterogeneity in the treatment effect according to ERBB2 status of the tumour (p=0.60 for interaction), thus, letrozole improves DFS compared with tamoxifen regardless of ERBB2 status. The observed HRs were 0.62 (95% CI 0.37-1.03) for ERBB2-positive tumours and 0.72 (0.59-0.87) for ERBB2-negative tumours. INTERPRETATION: A benefit of letrozole over tamoxifen was noted, irrespective of ERBB2 status of the tumour, and, therefore, ERBB2 status does not seem to be a selection criterion for treatment with letrozole versus tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with endocrine-responsive early breast cancer.",0

A randomized trial of mitomycin-C (M) versus mitomycin-C plus high-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate (MMPA) in the treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer.,"Seventy-six women with previously treated breast cancer were randomized to receive mitomycin (M) or M plus high-dose oral medroxyprogesterone acetate (MMPA). Patients were balanced with respect to age, performance status, hormone receptor status, previous treatment, and number of metastatic sites. There were more patients with visceral metastases in the M arm of the study. Side effects were tolerable and not significantly different for the two regimens. No life-threatening toxicity occurred. Objective response was documented in 4 of 37 patients on M and 11 of 39 on MMPA. On M the median time to treatment failure (TTF) was 3 months, and median survival was 7.8 months. On MMPA the median TTF was 4.4 months, and median survival was 9.7 months. There was a tendency for higher response and longer TTF and survival on MMPA, but statistical significance was not reached (p = 0.09).",1
The effect of exemestane on the lipidemic profile of postmenopausal early breast cancer patients: preliminary results of the TEAM Greek sub-study.,"INTRODUCTION: Long-term endocrine therapy for breast cancer may have clinical implications as drugs that potentially alter the lipid profile may increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. In this study, a companion sub-protocol to the TEAM (Tamoxifen and Exemestane Adjuvant Multicenter) International trial, we compared the effect of the steroidal aromatase inactivator exemestane on the lipid profile of postmenopausal women with early breast cancer in the adjuvant setting to that of tamoxifen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this open-label, randomized, parallel group study, 176 postmenopausal patients with estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive early breast cancer were randomized to either adjuvant exemestane (25 mg/day; n = 90) or tamoxifen (20 mg/day; n = 86). Assessments of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and serum triglycerides (TRG) were performed at baseline and every 3 months for the first 12 months. RESULTS: Serum triglyceride levels were consistently increased above baseline throughout the study in the tamoxifen arm, while there was a trend towards reduction in the exemestane arm. There was also an overall trend for tamoxifen to decrease the levels of LDL throughout the study period. Exemestane did not demonstrate any other significant change in HDL levels; however, there was a consistent trend for a reduction in total cholesterol in both treatment arms. The atherogenic risk determined by the TC:HDL ratio remained stable in both arms throughout the treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: Exemestane appears to have a neutral effect on total cholesterol and HDL levels. Unlike tamoxifen's positive effect on LDL levels, exemestane does not significantly alter LDL levels. Tamoxifen on the other hand increases triglyceride levels, while exemestane results in a beneficial reduction in TRG levels. These data offer additional information with regard to the safety and tolerability of exemestane in postmenopausal breast cancer patients and support further investigation of its potential usefulness in the adjuvant setting.",1
Randomized trial of single compared with tandem high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem-cell transplantation in patients with chemotherapy-sensitive metastatic breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: To compare progression-free survival between single and tandem high-dose chemotherapy (HDT) followed by autologous stem-cell transplantation in chemotherapy-sensitive metastatic breast cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between February 1997 and June 2001, 187 patients with complete and partial remission were randomly assigned to receive either one or two cycles of HDT, consisting of thiotepa (125 mg/m2/d for 4 days), cyclophosphamide (1,500 mg/m2/d for 4 days), and carboplatin (200 mg/m2/d for 4 days), followed by autologous stem-cell transplantation. RESULTS: One hundred seventy one of 187 randomly assigned patients completed first HDT, but only 52 of 85 completed the second HDT cycle in the tandem HDT arm. The rate of complete remission on an intent-to-treat-basis was 33% in the single-dose HDT arm and 37% in the tandem HDT arm (P = .48). The median progression-free survival times in single and tandem HDT arms were 9.4 and 11.2 months, respectively (one-sided P = .06; two one-sided P = .12), whereas median overall survival time tended to be greater after single versus tandem HDT (29 v 23.5 months, respectively; P = .4). In a multivariate analysis for progression-free survival, tandem HDT (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.98; P = .03) and achievement of complete remission after induction chemotherapy (HR = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.96; P = .03) were factors for a better progression-free survival, whereas the factor of three or more sites of metastases (HR = 1.66; 95% CI, 1.12 to 2.47; P = .01) was associated with a worse progression-free survival. CONCLUSION: Despite a trend of improved progression-free survival, tandem HDT cannot be recommended for patients with chemotherapy-sensitive metastatic breast cancer because of a trend for shorter overall survival and higher toxicity compared with single HDT.",1
Prognostic and predictive value of thymidine phosphorylase activity in early-stage breast cancer patients.,"The antitumor effects of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and its derivatives depend upon the activity of nucleoside metabolic enzymes in tumor tissues. Thymidine phosphorylase (TP) converts 5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (5'-DFUR), an intermediate metabolite of capecitabine, to 5-FU. The relationship between TP expression in tumor tissues and patient survival was retrospectively examined in early-stage breast cancer patients treated with either oral 5'-DFUR administered for 6 months or surgery alone in a prospective randomized controlled trial. Thymidine phosphorylase expression in tumor cells and tumor-associated stromal (TAS) cells was examined by immunohistochemistry in 650 tissue samples from patients in this trial (n = 1217). Eight-year follow-up data showed that high TP expression in tumor cells was a significant prognostic indicator of a favorable outcome only for the patients in the 5'-DFUR group. Thus, TP expression was shown to be a predictive factor of 5'-DFUR efficacy. Conversely, a low TP expression in TAS cells was also a potent favorable prognostic indicator. These results on TP status in 2 tumor cell types could provide novel information for predicting prognosis for a patient subgroup, which would receive a probable therapeutic effect from 5'-DFUR, and presumably, from adjuvant therapy of capecitabine in early-stage breast cancer. Determination of TP status might also identify a patient subgroup whose prognosis is quite favorable even without adjuvant therapy. Further investigations on prognostic and predictive implications of TP activity in a clinical setting are warranted.",0
Postoperative chemotherapy and chemohormonal therapy in women with node-positive breast cancer.,"Separate trials for premenopausal and postmenopausal (less than or equal to 65 yr of age) patients with node-positive breast carcinoma were initiated by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group in 1978 to evaluate adjuvant chemotherapy and chemohormonal therapy approaches. Postoperative patients were stratified by degree of axillary nodal involvement and estrogen receptor (ER) status prior to randomization. Premenopausal patients received 12 monthly cycles of intermittent cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF), CMF plus prednisone (CMFP), or CMFP plus continuous tamoxifen (CMFPT). Postmenopausal patients received either observation or 12 monthly cycles of CMFPT or CMFP. The median follow-up for the analyzed patients is 54 months for the 553 premenopausal patients and 59 months for the 223 postmenopausal patients. The premenopausal trial has not demonstrated any significant differences between the regimens for either relapse-free or overall survival. The relapse-free survival in the postmenopausal trial has demonstrated a trend for CMFPT over observation (P = .07). Both CMFP and CMFPT are associated with an improved relapse-free survival over observation alone in ER-negative patients (P = .01) and in progesterone receptor-negative patients (P = .01). However, the relapse-free survival advantages have not translated to survival. Side effects were significantly increased with the addition of P to CMF in the premenopausal trial. The addition of T to CMFP was associated with an increased incidence of edema and hot flashes in premenopausal patients; however, the latter was decreased in postmenopausal patients relative to CMFP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1
"Tamoxifen and megestrol acetate for postmenopausal breast cancer: diverging effects on liver proteins, androgens, and glucocorticoids.","AIM: To compare the effects of tamoxifen and megestrol acetate on liver proteins, androgens, and glucocorticoids during adjuvant treatment for postmenopausal breast cancer. METHODS: A subgroup of women within a large prospective multicenter trial were followed with blood sampling every 3 mo during 2 yr. Women were randomized to receive either continuous tamoxifen 40 mg/d or repeated sequential treatment with tamoxifen and megestrol acetate (MA) 160 mg/d. RESULTS: We found profound and distinct differences between the two regimens. Tamoxifen increased steroid-binding proteins (SHBG and CBG) and suppressed circulating androgens and IGF-I. In contrast, the metabolic effects of tamoxifen were clearly antagonized by MA. There was a rise in IGF-I and marked suppression of steroid-binding proteins. Levels of free testosterone were reduced by 70%. MA also caused apparent adrenal suppression. CONCLUSION: The different effects on anabolic/catabolic balance and adrenal function may relate to certain clinical effects during treatment.",0
"Gene polymorphisms in cyclophosphamide metabolism pathway,treatment-related toxicity, and disease-free survival in SWOG 8897 clinical trial for breast cancer.","PURPOSE: There are no established genetic markers for prediction of outcomes after cyclophosphamide (CP)-containing adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. In an ancillary study to a SWOG (Southwest Oncology Group) trial (S8897), we investigated functional polymorphisms in 4 genes in CP pharmacokinetic pathways in relation to hematologic toxicity and disease-free survival (DFS).EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Germline DNA was available from 458 women who were at high risk of relapse and was randomized to CAF (CP, intravenous doxorubicin, and 5-fluorouracil) versus CMF (CP, intravenous methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil) ± tamoxifen, and from 874 women who had a presumed favorable prognosis and did not receive adjuvant therapy. Odds ratios for grade 3 and 4 hematologic toxicity in the treated group and hazard ratios for DFS associated with selected functional polymorphisms in CYP2B6CYP3A4GSTA1 and GSTP1 were estimated by logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard regression.RESULTS: Compared with women with AA genotypes, those with at least 1 GSTP1 variant G allele had reduced risk of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia [odds ratios (OR) = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.41-0.97] and leucopenia (OR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.39-0.89). No other associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms and toxicity or survival were found in the treated or untreated group.CONCLUSION: Known genetic variants in genes involved in CP pharmacokinetics may not have major effects on DFS in breast cancer patients. The lower risk of developing high-grade hematologic toxicity among women with variant GSTP1 alleles suggests that genetic markers in combination with clinical factors may be useful in defining a subgroup of women who are less susceptible to adverse hematologic toxicities with CP-containing therapies.",0
Development of a new G-CSF product based on biosimilarity assessment.,"BACKGROUND: Zarzio, a new recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (filgrastim), was evaluated in healthy volunteers and neutropenic patients in phase I and III studies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Healthy volunteers in randomized, two-period crossover studies received single- and multiple-dose s.c. injections of 1 microg/kg (n = 24), 2.5 microg/kg (n = 28), 5 microg/kg (n = 28), or 10 microg/kg (n = 40), as well as single-dose i.v. infusions of 5 microg/kg (n = 26), of Zarzio or the reference product (Neupogen). Filgrastim serum levels were monitored; pharmacodynamic parameters were absolute neutrophil count (all studies) and CD34(+) cells (multiple-dose studies). Supportive efficacy and safety data were obtained from an open phase III study in 170 breast cancer patients undergoing four cycles of doxorubicin and docetaxel (Taxotere) chemotherapy, receiving Zarzio (300 or 480 microg) as primary prophylaxis of severe neutropenia. RESULTS: The results of the studies in healthy volunteers confirm the comparability of the test and reference products with respect to their pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. Confidence intervals were within the predefined equivalence boundaries. In the phase III study in breast cancer patients, the administration of Zarzio was efficacious and safe, triggering no immunogenicity. CONCLUSION: The results of these studies demonstrate the biosimilarity of Zarzio with its reference product Neupogen.",0
"Comparison of chemotherapy with chemohormonal therapy as first-line therapy for metastatic, hormone-sensitive breast cancer: An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group study.","PURPOSE: Although hormonal therapy represents standard therapy for metastatic hormone-sensitive disease, many patients receive initial chemotherapy because of the location, bulk, or aggressiveness of their disease. It is uncertain whether simultaneous hormonal therapy provides additional benefit compared with chemotherapy alone. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group trial E3186 was initiated to explore this question. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive or ER-unknown metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive either chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil ¿CAF) or chemohormonal therapy (CAF plus tamoxifen and Halotestin ¿fluoxymesterone; Pharmacia-Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI ¿CAFTH) as front-line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil, prednisone, and TH as a secondary randomization. RESULTS: The response rates (complete response and partial response) of patients who received CAF and CAFTH were similar (69.2% v 68.9%, respectively; P =.99). Time to treatment failure (TTF) was slightly longer for patients who received chemohormonal therapy compared with chemotherapy alone patients (13.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.087), and TTF was significantly longer in ER-positive compared with ER-negative patients (17.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.048). However, ER status had no effect on overall survival (30.0 months for CAF v 29.3 months for CAFTH). CONCLUSION: In patients with potentially hormone-sensitive metastatic breast cancer, chemohormonal therapy prolongs TTF for ER-positive patients without improving overall survival.",1
Sodium dithiocarb as adjuvant immunotherapy for high risk breast cancer: a randomized study.,"Sixty-four patients with non metastatic high risk breast cancer were randomized in a double blind trial of adjuvant immunotherapy with sodium dithiocarb (DDC) versus placebo. All patients underwent prior surgery (mammectomy according to Patey) then adjuvant FAC chemotherapy +/- DDC. With a median follow-up of 5 years we observed 6 relapses and 5 deaths in DDC group; 13 relapses and 12 deaths in control group. At 6 years, overall survival is 81% in DDC group versus 55%. Disease free survival (DFS) is 76% in DDC group versus 55%. DDC associated to chemotherapy and locoregional treatment can improve survival and probably DFS in this high risk breast cancer subgroup.",0
Phase III trial comparing three doses of docetaxel for second-line treatment of advanced breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate whether a relationship exists between docetaxel dose and clinical response in the treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients whose cancer had progressed after one prior chemotherapy regimen for advanced breast cancer or had recurred during or within 6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy were randomly assigned to docetaxel 60, 75, or 100 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks. RESULTS: Five hundred twenty-seven patients were randomly assigned (intent to treat [ITT]), and 524 were assessable for toxicity. In the population assessable for efficacy (n = 407), logistic regression analysis showed that increasing docetaxel dose was significantly associated with higher response rate (P = .007) and improved time to progression (TTP; P = .014). In the ITT analysis, a significant dose-response relationship was observed for tumor response (P = .026) but not for TTP (P = .067). The incidences of most hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities were related to increasing dose, with grade 3 to 4 neutropenia occurring in 76.4%, 83.7%, and 93.4% and febrile neutropenia occurring in 4.7%, 7.4%, and 14.1% of patients administered the 60, 75, and 100 mg/m2 doses, respectively. One death was considered treatment related. CONCLUSION: A relationship between increasing dose of docetaxel and increased tumor response was observed across the dose range of 60 to 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. Toxicities were related to increasing dose. Depending on the therapy goal, any of the doses studied may be appropriate for second-line treatment of advanced breast cancer.",1
"Adjuvant cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and fluorouracil in node-negative and estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer. Updated results.","BACKGROUND: Node-negative breast cancers are considered to comprise a subgroup which is amenable to cure with local-regional therapy alone. However, approximately 30% of affected patients present new disease manifestations within 10 years after surgery. To test the hypothesis that node-negative and estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer patients can benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, a prospective randomized study was activated at the Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milan in 1980. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was conducted in 90 patients operated on for unilateral breast cancer who were then assigned to receive either 12 intravenous cycles of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and fluorouracil (CMF) every three weeks, or no further treatment. Adjuvant chemotherapy was administered in the outpatient clinic of the Division of Medical Oncology. Patient characteristics were fairly well balanced between the two treatment groups except for primary tumor size: 58% of those with a primary tumor measuring > 2 cm in its largest diameter were randomized in the control group compared with 38% in the CMF regimen (P = 0.06). RESULTS: At 12 years after surgery treatment outcome was significantly superior for patients given adjuvant CMF. The relapse-free survival rate was 71% (95% confidence limits (CL): 56-86) versus 43% (95% CL: 28-58), and total survival was 80% (95% CL: 68-92) versus 50% (95% CL: 34-66), respectively. The benefit from the administration of CMF was evident in all patient subsets and was not influenced by menopausal status. CONCLUSIONS: The long-term results of this trial of adjuvant combination chemotherapy confirm our previous observations on the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy in node-negative breast cancer patients at high risk of early disease relapse.",1
"Short-term anastrozole therapy reduces Ki-67 and progesterone receptor expression in invasive breast cancer: a prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial.","PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to compare Ki-67, Bcl-2, Bax, Bak, ER, and PgR expression in postmenopausal women with ER-positive invasive breast cancer (IBC) before and after short-term hormone therapy (HT) with either tamoxifen or anastrozole in order to identify a possible biomarker profile associated with hormone resistance.METHODS: Fifty-eight patients with palpable IBC were assigned to receive neoadjuvant therapy with either anastrozole, placebo, or tamoxifen for 26 days prior to surgery. Tissue microarray blocks were constructed from pre- and post-treatment biopsy samples and used for immunohistochemical analysis. Biomarker (Ki-67, Bcl-2, Bax, Bak, ER, and PgR) levels were assessed semiquantitatively using the Allred score. A statistical analysis was performed using general estimating equations (GEE) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a significance level of 0.05.RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in PgR scores from baseline (mean, 4.22) to post-treatment (mean, 1.94) in the anastrozole group, but only a non-significant trend toward an increase in PgR scores was found in the tamoxifen group. There was a significant reduction in Ki-67 scores from baseline (mean, 3.61) to post-treatment (mean, 2.56) in the anastrozole group (P = 0.01), but only a non-significant trend toward a reduction in Ki-67 scores was found in the tamoxifen group.CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant reduction in PgR and Ki-67 expression in the group treated with anastrozole. In the present study, the short-term HT was not associated with changes in apoptosis-related protein levels, regardless the type of drug used.",0
"TRIO-012: a multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind phase III study of IMC-1121B plus docetaxel versus placebo plus docetaxel in previously untreated patients with HER2-negative, unresectable, locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer.","In this multinational, placebo-controlled, randomized phase III trial, Translational Research In Oncology (TRIO) will define the efficacy and safety of adding a novel antiangiogenic agent, IMC-1121B (ramucirumab), to standard first-line docetaxel chemotherapy for women with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer.

Adjuvant CMF for node-negative and estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer patients.,"From December 1980 to September 1985, a total of 90 eligible patients with stage T1-3a, node-negative, and estrogen receptor-negative (less than or equal to 10 fmol/mg of cytosol protein) tumors were entered into a randomized study to assess the effectiveness of adjuvant intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) in a subset of patients at high risk of early disease relapse. High values of [3H]thymidine labeling index were documented in two thirds of 62 assessed specimens from the patient population, and one half of the patients had histologically undifferentiated tumors. Patients were allocated to either local-regional modality alone (control group, 45 women) or to CMF (45 patients) after surgery. A full dose of CMF (600 mg/m2 each of cyclophosphamide and fluorouracil, and 40 mg/m2 of methotrexate) was administered IV on day 1, and then repeated every 3 weeks for a total of 12 treatments. After a median follow-up of 80 months, the 7-year results confirmed the superiority of adjuvant CMF compared to local-regional modality alone (relapse-free survival 85% vs 42%, P = .0001; total survival 86% vs 58%, P = .006). A benefit from adjuvant CMF was observed in all subgroups, and the rates of both local-regional and distant failure were decreased. Treatment was fairly well tolerated and devoid of life-threatening toxicity. Present results confirm our previous observation concerning the dismal prognosis of node-negative and estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer patients as well as the beneficial effect of adjuvant chemotherapy in this selected subset.",1
Circulating endothelial-cell kinetics and viability predict survival in breast cancer patients receiving metronomic chemotherapy.,"Antiangiogenic agents and therapeutic strategies have entered the clinical oncology arena. The classical tumor size measurements defined to monitor efficacy of chemotherapy, however, might not be appropriate for these newer therapeutics. We previously found that circulating endothelial cells (CECs) were increased in number and more viable in cancer patients compared with control subjects. We investigated the correlation between CEC kinetics and clinical outcome in patients with advanced breast cancer receiving metronomic chemotherapy, a therapeutic strategy associated with antiangiogenic activity and anticancer efficacy. CEC number and viability were measured by flow cytometry in patients and in preclinical models. CECs were decreased in patients for whom no overall clinical benefit (defined as a clinical response or a stable disease) was observed compared with those who had a clinical benefit (P = .015). This difference was due to an increased fraction of apoptotic CECs in patients with a clinical benefit. Univariate and multivariate analyses indicated that CEC values greater than 11/microL were associated with a longer progression-free survival (P = .001) and an improved overall survival (P = .005). Preclinical models indicated that the source of apoptotic CECs was most likely the tumor vasculature. CEC kinetics and viability are very promising as predictors of clinical response in patients undergoing metronomic chemotherapy.",0
Analysis of time to response to chemotherapy in 316 metastatic breast cancer patients.,"Chemotherapy is a major tool for metastatic breast cancer treatment. In this study, a series of 316 patients have been analyzed to evaluate the time needed to reach tumor response by means of combination chemotherapy. Twenty-five percent of patients responded within 3 months and virtually all responses occurred within 7.5 months. The time curves of response (any) and best response are superimposable. A subset analysis has shown that the following pretreatment characteristics predict a significantly longer time to response: prior exposure to adjuvant chemotherapy, nodal positivity at diagnosis, no previous endocrine treatment and osseous metastases.",0
Chemotherapy-induced emesis: management of early and delayed emesis in milder emetogenic regimens.,"The objective of the present study was to examine the problem of the control of nausea and vomiting induced by non-cisplatin containing cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy regimens in breast cancer patients. This was randomized, double-blind, parallel-group and placebo-controlled study comparing the efficacy of three antiemetic therapeutic regimens (ondansetron for 3 days, ondasetron plus metoclopramide, and ondansetron given in a single dose) in breast cancer patients receiving cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy regimens on an outpatient basis. Both the primary and the secondary efficacy were measured. The primary efficacy variable was the number of emetic episodes (considering early and delayed emesis). The secondary efficacy variable measured was the quality of life. Two-by-two tables using the chi-square test and relative-risk concept were elaborated for statistical analysis. There was no difference between high-dose ondansetron and ondansetron plus metoclopramide among patients given CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil). The single-dose ondansetron regimen showed the worst results. In patients given an FEC regimen (cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, 5-fluorouracil) the antiemetic efficacy was best for the high-dose ondansetron regimen, followed by the ondansetron plus metoclopramide regimen, and was worst for single-dose ondansetron administration. Despite the use of different antiemetic schedules, nausea and emesis are significant problems in patients receiving cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy. Their adequate control should be the aim of any antiemetic approach.",0
"A randomised trial comparing combination chemotherapy using mitomycin C, mitozantrone and methotrexate (3M) with vincristine, anthracycline and cyclophosphamide (VAC) in advanced breast cancer.","This paper describes a randomised clinical trial in patients with advanced breast cancer, comparing the regimen 3M, mitomycin C 7-8 mg m-2 (day 1), mitozantrone 7-8 mg m-2 (day 1 and 21), methotrexate 35 mg m-2 (day 1 and 21) given on a 42 day cycle with a standard anthracycline containing regimen, VAC, vincristine 1.4 mg m-2 (day 1), anthracycline (adriamycin or epirubicin) 30 mg m-2 (day 1), cyclophosphamide 400 mg m-2 (day 1) given on a 21 day cycle. Of a total of 217 patients, 107 were randomised to 3M and 110 to VAC and a mean of 5.5 courses was given per patient. The overall response rate (complete and partial) was 53% (95% Confidence Limits (CL): 43-62%) for 3M and 49% (CL; 39-58%) for VAC. The response according to sites of metastases was the same for both treatment groups. Symptomatic toxicity including alopecia, neuropathy, vomiting (P less than 0.001) and nausea (P less than 0.01) were significantly less for 3M. Myelosuppression including leucopenia (P less than 0.001) and thrombocytopenia (P less than 0.001) was significantly greater with 3M at day 21, although there was no difference in nadir counts in patients at special risk of myelosuppression and there was no evidence of an increase in infective or bleeding complications. There was no significant difference in the duration of response to 3M (10 months, CL 6-15) and VAC (11 months, CL 7-12), nor in survival (3M, 8 months, CL 6-12; VAC, 10 months, CL 8-12). These results indicate that 3M is as effective as, but has significantly less symptomatic toxicity than, an anthracycline containing regimen for the treatment of advanced breast cancer.",1
1-hexylcarbamoyl-5-fluorouracil + cyclophosphamide + tamoxifen versus CMF + tamoxifen in women with lymph node-positive breast cancer after primary surgery: a randomized controlled trial.,"We studied the usefulness of the oral 5-FU anti-cancer drug 1-hexylcarbamoyl-5-fluorouracil (HCFU) + cyclophosphamide (CPM) + tamoxifen (TAM) (HCT group) in comparison with CMF + TAM (CMFT group) in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer by a non-inferiority study based on a multi-institutional joint study. Clinical stage I, II primary breast cancers with histologically positive axillary lymph node metastasis were randomly assigned to the HCT group or the CMFT group after primary surgery. We registered 136 cases (HCT group 68 cases, CMFT group 68 cases). No significant difference in the 5-year overall survival rate (OS) and the 5-year disease-free survival rate (DFS) was found between the two groups. In the stratified analysis, DFS in cases in which the number of metastatic lymph nodes was 1-3 was significantly better in the HCT group (HCT group 84.3%, CMFT group 69.4%, log-rank test p=0.0496). No significant difference in the total incidence of adverse effects was found between the two groups, but there were significantly less adverse effects of grade 2 or over in the HCT group (p=0.034). The QOL survey at 3 months after surgery showed a significant decline of the QOL regarding lassitude, degree of difficulty in daily life, satisfaction with treatment and present mood in the CMFT group. Study results suggest that 2-year HCT therapy including the oral 5-FU anti-cancer drug HCFU is a useful adjuvant therapy which can replace CMFT therapy in early breast cancer cases with 3 or lower metastatic lymph nodes.",1
Adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy in breast cancer.,"Three hundred and twenty-two women with involvement of axillary lymph nodes following surgery for operable breast cancer were randomized to receive either postoperative radiotherapy, chemotherapy (CMF) or radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy. There was an increase in disease free interval in pre- and postmenopausal patients receiving radiotherapy and chemotherapy regardless of the number of nodes involved. However, there was a trend towards an improvement in disease related survival only in those patients with more than three nodes involved.",1
Effects of fulvestrant 750mg in premenopausal women with oestrogen-receptor-positive primary breast cancer.,"Fulvestrant (Faslodex) is a pure anti-oestrogen that reduces markers of hormone sensitivity and proliferation in postmenopausal women with oestrogen-receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. This randomised trial compared the effects on the tumours of a single dose of 750mg fulvestrant to those of daily tamoxifen (20mg) taken 14-16 days prior to surgery in 60 premenopausal women with ER-positive primary breast cancer. There were statistically significant falls in the expression of ER and Ki67 levels compared to the baseline with both drugs. Both drugs caused a decrease in PgR expression from baseline but this was only statistically significant with fulvestrant. No statistically significant differences were seen between the two treatment groups. Fulvestrant caused an increase in circulating levels of oestradiol, irrespective of the stage of the menstrual cycle at which patients commenced treatment. No major changes were seen in LH, FSH and progesterone levels with either drug. The most common adverse events with fulvestrant were headaches, hot flushes, nausea and disturbance of menses. Contrary to previous studies with fulvestrant 250mg, these findings suggest that at a dose of 750mg fulvestrant is effective at reducing the effects of oestrogen on ER-positive breast cancer in premenopausal women.",1
"A phase I study of AMGN-0007, a recombinant osteoprotegerin construct, in patients with multiple myeloma or breast carcinoma related bone metastases.","BACKGROUND: Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a decoy receptor for OPG ligand (OPGL), or receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL). RANKL/RANK interaction is important in terminal differentiation and activation of osteoclasts. In binding to RANKL, OPG blocks differentiation and activation of osteoclasts. AMGN-0007 is a recombinant OPG construct developed as a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of bone disease. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, single-dose, dose escalation study was conducted to determine the safety and effect on bone resorption of AMGN-0007 in patients with multiple myeloma (n = 28) or breast carcinoma (n = 26) with radiologically confirmed lytic bone lesions. Patients were randomized (3:1 ratio) to receive a single dose of either AMGN-0007 (subcutaneously [SC]) or pamidronate (90 mg intravenously) and were followed for 56 days. Medications or other diseases affecting bone metabolism and chemotherapy within 28 days of dosing were exclusion criteria. Biologic activity of AMGN-0007 was assessed by measurement of the surrogate marker of bone resorption, urinary N-telopeptide of collagen (NTX). RESULTS: AMGN-0007 caused a rapid, sustained, dose-dependent decrease in NTX/creatinine levels, which was at least comparable to the profile observed with pamidronate. Four serious adverse events were reported, three in breast carcinoma patients: a fracture in the left femur (pamidronate, considered unrelated), extreme fatigue (0.3 mg/kg AMGN-0007, considered unrelated), and congestive heart failure (1.0 mg/kg AMGN-0007, considered by the investigator to be probably related to doxorubicin and radiation therapy); one event occurred in a multiple myeloma patient: Herpes zoster (pamidronate, considered unrelated). Two multiple myeloma patients (1.0 mg/kg AMGN-0007) had albumin-adjusted serum calcium levels of 1.9 mmol/L on Day 8 but without clinical symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: A single SC dose of AMGN-0007 suppressed bone resorption as indicated by a rapid, sustained, and profound decrease of urinary NTX/creatinine in multiple myeloma and breast carcinoma patients. Changes were comparable to those with pamidronate. AMGN-0007 was well tolerated.",0
Late effects of adjuvant oophorectomy and chemotherapy upon premenopausal breast cancer patients.,"Between 1978 and 1981 we conducted a trial (Trial II) in premenopausal and perimenopausal breast cancer patients with 4 or more metastatic axillary lymph nodes. 327 evaluable patients were randomized after at least a total mastectomy and axillary clearance to receive either a combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, and low-dose prednisone (CMFp), or surgical oophorectomy followed by the same CMFp therapy (Ox + CMFp). Cytotoxic drugs were administered for 12 4-week courses. At a median follow-up of 96 months, the 8-year disease-free survival (DFS) percentages (+/- s.e.) for CMFp and Ox + CMFp were 30% +/- 4% and 37% +/- 4%, respectively (p = 0.17). The overall survival percentages were 41% +/- 4% and 50% +/- 4%, respectively (p = 0.20). In a subgroup analysis by estrogen receptor content of the primary, the differences were observed in patients with tumors classified as ER+ (8-year DFS: 26% +/- 7%, 41% +/- 7%; p = 0.09) but not in those with ER- tumors (8-year DFS: 29% +/- 7%, 25% +/- 7%; p = 0.92). Analysis of sites of first relapse showed that the difference between the two treatment groups can be entirely attributed to the reduction in bone metastases in the oophorectomized group (Ox + CMFp). We conclude that for very high risk premenopausal breast cancer patients, the effects of oophorectomy added to an adjuvant cytotoxic regimen will be observed late in the patients' follow-up period. We hypothesize that the reduction of relapses in distant sites is due to the extended effects of the endocrine therapy.",0
Duration and reintroduction of adjuvant chemotherapy for node-positive premenopausal breast cancer patients.,"PURPOSE: The optimal duration and timing of adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer patients remain uncertain and were prospectively studied. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We randomly assigned 1,554 premenopausal breast cancer patients with node-positive disease in a 2 x 2 factorial design to receive the following: (A) cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil for 6 consecutive courses on months 1 to 6 (CMF x 6); (B) CMFx6 plus three single courses of reintroduction CMF given on months 9, 12, and 15; (C) CMF for three consecutive courses on months 1 to 3 (CMFx3); or (D) CMFx3 plus three single courses of reintroduction CMF given on months 6, 9, and 12. Accrual was between July 1986 and April 1993. A total of 1,475 patients (95%) were eligible and assessable. The median follow-up duration was 60 months. RESULTS: Patients who received CMFx3 without reintroduction had a 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate of 53% compared with 58% for the other three treatment groups (hazards ratio [HR], 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00 to 1.45; P = .04). The increased risk of relapse with CMFx3 was more marked for women aged less than 40 years (308 patients; HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.84; P = .11) and for patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors (455 patients; HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.06 to 2.00; P = .02). Reintroduction chemotherapy provided additional benefit (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.01; p = .07), especially for women > or = 40 years of age (1,167 patients; HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.99; P = .04). CONCLUSION: Three courses of adjuvant CMF chemotherapy are not sufficient compared with longer duration CMF chemotherapy, especially in younger women and in patients with ER-negative primary tumors. Reintroduction chemotherapy showed some evidence of additional benefit, but remains investigational.",1
Xeloda and Taxotere: a review of the development of the combination for use in metastatic breast cancer.,"Docetaxel (Taxotere) and capecitabine (Xeloda) demonstrate synergy in pre-clinical studies and both show high single-agent efficacy in metastatic breast cancer patients previously treated with an anthracycline. The two drugs used in combination in a similar group of patients have been evaluated in a randomised phase III trial comparing this combination with single-agent docetaxel. The results of this study indicate the combination arm to be favourable with significantly superior median time to disease progression (6.1 vs 4.2 months, hazard ratio 0.652, p=0.0001), objective response rate and overall survival without a significant increase in the overall incidence of treatment related adverse effects. This combination of docetaxel and capecitabine provides improved survival prospects for patients with metastatic breast cancer. Ongoing studies will provide further data to optimise the scheduling and use of this combination in the future.",0
Pilot study of cranial stimulation for symptom management in breast cancer.,"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To examine the feasibility, relationships among variables, and preliminary outcomes of a self-directed complementary modality, cranial electrical stimulation (CES), for symptom management in women receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer. DESIGN: Biobehavioral pilot feasibility study. SETTING: Two university-based cancer centers. SAMPLE: 36 women with stage I-IIIA breast cancer scheduled to receive chemotherapy. METHODS: Data were collected via interview, questionnaires, and interactive voice technology (IVR). Biomarkers were measured from a blood sample taken prior to the initial chemotherapy. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Symptoms of depression, anxiety, fatigue, pain, and sleep disturbances; biomarkers (proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-alpha], interleukin-1 beta) and C-reactive protein [CRP]); and CES. FINDINGS: CES appears to be a safe and acceptable modality during chemotherapy. Recruitment and retention were adequate. IVR was associated with missing data. Symptoms of depression, anxiety, fatigue, and sleep disturbances were highly correlated with each other, and most symptoms were correlated with CRP at baseline. Depression and TNF-alpha had a positive, significant relationship. Levels of depression increased over time and trended toward less increase in the CES group; however, the differences among groups were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The data support the feasibility of CES. Further testing in larger samples is needed to examine the efficacy of CES for symptom management of multiple, concurrent symptoms and to further develop the biobehavioral framework. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Interventions that are effective at minimizing more than one target symptom are especially needed to provide optimal symptom management for women with breast cancer.",0
Antiemetic efficacy of dexamethasone therapy in patients receiving cancer chemotherapy.,"To assess the value of high-dose dexamethasone therapy in preventing the gastrointestinal (GI) side effects of chemotherapy, a randomized double-blind study was conducted in women receiving outpatient therapy for breast cancer. Single-dose dexamethasone sodium phosphate (10 mg) or placebo was administered intravenously in 57 trials in 22 women immediately before chemotherapy. Questionnaires (administered before therapy and 24 hours later) were compared for evidence of nausea, vomiting, and anorexia produced by chemotherapy. No GI intolerance to chemotherapy was noted in 24 (83%) of the 29 dexamethasone trials v 16 (57%) of the 28 placebo trials. Dexamethasone trials produced the following results: no side effects in 50% (14/29), insomnia the night after chemotherapy in 21% (6/29), an increase in energy levels in 24% (7/29), and an improvement in mood in 14% (4/29). High-dose dexamethasone therapy has useful application in alleviating the emetic effects of cancer chemotherapy.",0
Emerging modalities for adjuvant therapy of breast cancer: neoadjuvant chemotherapy.,"There is evidence from theoretical models and experimental studies that indicates that preoperative timing of chemotherapy (neoadjuvant treatment) may be a superior treatment strategy than its use postoperatively. We have shown in our pilot study of 43 premenopausal patients with newly diagnosed cancer of the breast that administration of one cycle of CMF chemotherapy preoperatively was safe. Subsequently, a randomized study of preoperative against postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy has been started and to the present time, 98 patients have been randomized. Preliminary assessment of the randomized study confirmed the safety of the adjuvant chemotherapy with one course of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil given preoperatively and also showed that the interval between diagnosis and the first course of chemotherapy can be substantially reduced. In addition to the preoperative timing, other aspects of the neoadjuvant approach are discussed. They include a more frequent utilization of fine needle aspiration so that the tissue diagnosis of breast cancer can be obtained and also refinement of diagnostic techniques, used before the preoperative treatment for the selection of high-risk patients (the neoadjuvant staging). The purpose of our presentation is not to recommend presently preoperative chemotherapy routinely but rather to indicate a need for well-controlled studies testing its appealing theoretical rationale. Its use in adjuvant therapy of breast cancer represents a major departure from the conventional management and, therefore, if the cooperation of practitioners and cooperative groups is to be secured, its rationale and safety must be well-defined.",0
Tamoxifen adjuvant treatment duration in early breast cancer: initial results of a randomized study comparing short-term treatment with long-term treatment. Fédération Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer Breast Group.,"PURPOSE: In 1986, The Fédération Nationale desCentres de Lutte Contre le Cancer Breast Group initiated a multicenter randomized trial to assess the usefulness of long-term adjuvant tamoxifen treatment. Short-term adjuvant tamoxifen treatment was to be compared with life long adjuvant tamoxifen treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients who were disease-free after 2 to 3 years of adjuvant tamoxifen treatment were eligible for the trial. From September 1986 to May 1995, 3,793 patients were randomized from France, Belgium, and Argentina. A total of 1,882 patients stopped tamoxifen (short-term group), and 1,911 patients were to continue tamoxifen for life (long-term group) at the same dose as previously prescribed. The protocol was modified in February 1997, limiting tamoxifen treatment to 10 years after randomization, thus giving a comparison between a 2- to 3-year treatment and a 12- to 13-year treatment. To date, the median duration of tamoxifen treatment is 30 months in the short-term group, and 70 months in the long-term group. RESULTS: Overall, longer tamoxifen treatment induced a 23% reduction in relapse rates, leading to a 7-year disease-free survival rate of 78%, compared with 72% in the shorter-treatment group. In contrast, overall survival did not differ between the two groups, with a 79% overall survival rate in both groups. This improvement in disease-free survival could be observed in node-positive patients (P: =.001); however, it was not found in node-negative patients. Prolonged tamoxifen treatment corresponded to a significant increase in disease-free survival in estrogen receptor-positive patients (P: =.03) as well as in estrogen receptor-negative patients (P: =.05). Furthermore, longer treatment reduced contralateral breast cancers and did not increase the number of endometrial cancers. CONCLUSION: Although no survival advantage was noted, patients did benefit from longer tamoxifen treatment over 3 years and had significantly better disease-free survival compared with patients who stopped hormonal treatment. Long-term follow-up is needed to assess these results. Most patients in the long-term group are still receiving treatment. Comparison of results as time passes will enable conclusions to be made on the value of long-term treatment over 5 years compared with 2 to 3 years.",1
Adjuvant therapy with tamoxifen in operable breast cancer. 10 year results of the Naples (GUN) study.,"Treatment with tamoxifen (TM), alone or in combination with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF), was used as an adjuvant to surgery in 433 patients with stage I, II, or III(T3a) breast cancer. Oestrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone (PgR) receptors were assayed in most cases. 308 premenopausal node-negative and postmenopausal node-negative or node-positive patients were randomised to receive TM, 30 mg daily for 2 years, or no further therapy. 125 premenopausal node-positive patients were randomised to receive either CMF for nine courses plus TM or CMF alone. After a median follow-up of 63 months TM significantly reduced the incidence of relapses and deaths compared with no therapy. A significant interaction between treatment effect and ER/PgR status was seen. Disease-free and overall survival were similar after treatment with CMF+ TM or CMF.",1
Dichloromethylene diphosphonate action in hematologic and other malignancies.,"We have studied the administration of both oral and intravenous dichloromethylene diphosphonate (Cl2MDP) in patients with hypercalcemia and/or hypercalciuria due to increased bone resorption in the setting of multiple myeloma (N = 16) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (N = 1). The effectiveness of 1600 mg of oral Cl2MDP twice daily was studied in 14 subjects with refractory multiple myeloma, active osteolytic disease and either persistent hypercalciuria (urinary Ca greater than 200 mg per g creatine on a low Ca intake) or hypercalcemia (serum Ca greater than 11.0 mg/dl), in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 16 week-long trial. Of the 12 patients who received Cl2MDP (2 died in the placebo phase), 11 had marked reductions in urinary calcium (P less than 0.001), which fell into the normal range in 9. Urinary hydroxyproline decreased significantly in 8. Eight of the 11 responders also appeared to have decreases in bone pain associated with Cl2MDP therapy. Similar results were found when this protocol was used in a study of 10 women with breast cancer metastatic to bone. In addition, intravenous Cl2MDP was studied in 12 patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy, of whom 2 had multiple myeloma and 1 had chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) associated with extensive osteolytic bone destruction. We gave 2.5 mg/kg on the first treatment day and 5 mg/kg daily thereafter for up to six more days. Serum calcium fell to normal after a mean of four days in the three patients with hematologic malignancies as well as in eight of the nine with solid tumors. Both urinary Ca and OHP also declined significantly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0
"Adjuvant chemotherapy followed by goserelin compared with either modality alone: the impact on amenorrhea, hot flashes, and quality of life in premenopausal patients--the International Breast Cancer Study Group Trial VIII.","PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to compare quality of life (QOL) and menopausal symptoms among premenopausal patients with lymph node-negative breast cancer receiving chemotherapy, goserelin, or their sequential combination, and to investigate differential effects by age. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated QOL data from 874 pre- and perimenopausal women with lymph node-negative breast cancer who were randomly assigned to receive six courses of classical cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) chemotherapy, ovarian suppression with goserelin for 24 months, or six courses of classical CMF followed by 18 months of goserelin. We report QOL data collected during 3 years after random assignment in patients without disease recurrence. RESULTS: Overall, patients receiving goserelin alone showed a marked improvement or less deterioration in QOL measures over the first 6 months than those patients treated with CMF. There were no differences at 3 years after random assignment according to treatment except for hot flashes. As reflected in the hot flashes scores, patients in all three treatment groups experienced induced amenorrhea, but the onset of ovarian function suppression was slightly delayed for patients receiving chemotherapy. Younger patients (< 40 years) who received goserelin alone returned to their premenopausal status at 6 months after the cessation of therapy, while those who received CMF showed marginal changes from their baseline hot flashes scores. CONCLUSION: Age-adjusted risk profiles that consider patient-reported outcomes enable patients to adapt to their disease and treatment, such as considering the trade-offs between delayed endocrine symptoms, but higher risk of permanent menopause with chemotherapy, and immediate but reversible endocrine symptoms with goserelin, in younger premenopausal patients.",0

A comparison of the outcomes of non-randomised chemotherapy regimens in node positive breast cancer.,"Adjuvant chemotherapy increases disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) following surgery for breast cancer. However, debates concerning the type of adjuvant chemotherapy continue. The effect of adjuvant chemotherapy on loco-regional recurrence-free survival (LFS) was also reported. The present study was undertaken to compare the results of adjuvant FAC (5-fluorouracil, Doxorubicin, Cyclophosphamide) and CMF (Cyclophosphamide, Methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil) chemotherapy on DFS, OS and LFS for node positive breast carcinoma treated with mastectomy in a non-randomised setting. Data from 688 consecutive lymph node positive breast cancer patients who underwent radical or modified radical mastectomy and received adjuvant FAC (600/60/600 mgr/m2 for 6 cycles every three weeks) or CMF (600/40/600 mgr/m2 for 6 cycles on days land 8 every four weeks) chemotherapy were reviewed. The effect of FAC on DFS, OS and LFS as compared with CMF was analysed. Survival curves were generated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and a multivariate analysis was performed by the Cox proportional hazard model. Adjuvant FAC was found to improve DFS, OS and LFS. 5-year DFS, OS and LFS were longer for patients treated with FAC as compared to CMF (67% versus 53%, p < 0.001; 77% versus 66%, p < 0.001, and 97% versus 91%). Adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for potential risk factors and tamoxifen treatment showed that FAC treated patients much benefitted in terms of survival as compared to CMF treated patients (HR 0.53, CI 0.40-0.69 for DFS; HR 0.48, CI 0.35-0.65 for OS, and HR 0.33, CI 0.16-0.65 for LFS). In conclusion, adjuvant FAC improves DFS, OS and LFS as compared to CMF in node positive breast carcinoma patients treated with mastectomy.",0
Comparison of induction chemotherapies for metastatic breast cancer. An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Trial.,"Patients with advanced breast carcinoma and no prior chemotherapy were prospectively evaluated to assess the induction capabilities of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF), Adriamycin and vincristine (AV), and CMF plus prednisone (CMFP). The crossover responsiveness from CMF or CMFP to AV and of AV to CMF were also assessed. A disproportionate randomization led to 166 analyzable cases on AV, 79 on CMF were also assessed. A disproportionate randomization led to 166 analyzable cases on AV, 79 on CMF and 86 on CMFP induction. One hundred and twelve patients were evaluated on crossover. Induction response rates were similar with 56% on AV, 57% on CMF and 63% on CMFP. Crossover response rates ranged from 32% to 41%. CMFP and AV were superior to CMF in terms of response duration (P = 0.05), and CMFP was superior to either in terms of time to treatment failure (P = 0.04), and survival (P = 0.03). Treatment failures occurred in only the on-study organ sites of disease in 73% of the patients and did not appear to be related to the response achieved. CMF was associated with more thrombocytopenia than either AV or CMFP (P = 0.03). AV was associated with fewer infections than CMFP (P = 0.02), less diarrhea than CMFP (P = 0.04), more emesis than CMF (P = 0.02), and more neurologic toxicity than either CMF or CMFP (P less than 0.0001). There was also more emesis with CMF than with CMFP (P = 0.006). CMFP was associated with greater delivery of CMF than was the CMF regimen despite a similar day 1 leukocyte distribution. These results strongly suggest that CMF(P) and AV are clinically noncross-resistant regimens, that AV and CMF are essentially equivalently active induction regimens, and that CMFP is superior to CMF and AV.",1
Evidence of a castration-mediated effect of adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy in premenopausal breast cancer.,"This prospective randomized trial, conducted by the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group, is the largest study, so far, of adjuvant chemotherapy in premenopausal breast cancer. The trial is unique in that it is nationwide and based on a nonselected population of patients, and is the only adjuvant trial studying the effect of cyclophosphamide monotherapy. After total mastectomy with axillary node sampling, followed by local radiotherapy, 1,032 pre- and perimenopausal women with operable breast cancer were randomized to observation alone, or to adjuvant chemotherapy for 1 year with either cyclophosphamide monotherapy or with a combination of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF). As of January 1987, median follow-up was 68 months. From early on both cyclophosphamide alone and CMF were found to improve recurrence-free survival (RFS) significantly and to a similar degree (P = .0001). However, an overall survival advantage did not become evident until 5 years after the start of treatment. So far, this advantage appears to be more pronounced in CMF (P = .0065) than in cyclophosphamide-only patients (P = .08). Thus, the study confirms the findings of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast Project (NSABP) and Milan trials that adjuvant chemotherapy prolongs the survival of premenopausal women with early breast cancer. A retrospective analysis revealed that, in contrast with CMF, cyclophosphamide alone did not improve RFS significantly in subsets of patients without amenorrhea, with estrogen-receptor (ER) negative tumors, and with tumors of low histological differentiation. Assuming that cyclophosphamide alone is a less tumoricidal treatment than CMF, these findings suggest that the effect of adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy is mediated partly through chemical castration, and partly through a purely cytotoxic effect.",1
Delayed administration of dexrazoxane provides cardioprotection for patients with advanced breast cancer treated with doxorubicin-containing therapy.,"PURPOSE: To assess whether dexrazoxane (DZR) given after a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 300 mg/m2 confers cardioprotection in patients with advanced breast cancer treated with fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In two multicenter studies (088001 and 088006), patients were randomized to receive FAC and placebo (PLA) versus FAC and DZR. After a protocol amendment, all patients received open-label DZR after they had reached a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 300 mg/m2. Two groups were compared: 99 patients randomized to the PLA arms before the amendment who received FAC and PLA for at least seven courses (PLA group), and 102 patients randomized to the PLA arms after the amendment who received FAC and PLA for six courses followed by open-label DZR (PLA/DZR group). RESULTS: The hazards ratio of PLA to PLA/DZR was 3.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.2 to 5.7; P < .001, logrank and generalized Wilcoxon tests) for the doxorubicin dose at any cardiac event, ejection fraction changes, or congestive heart failure (CHF). The hazards ratio of PLA to PLA/DZR was 13.1 (95% CI, 3.7 to 46.0; P < .001, logrank and generalized Wilcoxon tests) for the doxorubicin dose at the development of CHF. The overall incidence of CHF in the PLA/DZR group was 3%, compared with 22% in the PLA group (P < .001, Fisher's exact test). Twenty-six percent of PLA/DZR patients received at least 15 courses of therapy, compared with 5% of patients in the PLA group. These results do not appear to be attributable to a time trend. CONCLUSION: DZR is a highly effective cardioprotective agent when used in patients with advanced breast cancer who continue to receive doxorubicin-based chemotherapy after a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 300 mg/m2 has been reached.",0

A randomised comparison of oestrogen suppression with anastrozole and formestane in postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer.,"The relative efficacy and tolerability of the aromatase inhibitors anastrozole (Arimidex) and formestane are assessed in a direct comparative trial in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer. Final results are available and reported here only for oestradiol suppression. Patients were randomised to receive either oral anastrozole, 1 mg once daily, or formestane, 250 mg every 2 weeks intramuscularly. In the anastrozole group, mean serum oestradiol levels fell from 32.1 pmol/l at baseline to 6.5 pmol/l at week 1, and similar levels of suppression were maintained over the next 3 weeks. In the formestane group, mean serum oestradiol levels fell from 31.0 pmol/l at baseline to 9.5 pmol/l at the week 1 assessment. In this group, serum oestradiol levels tended to rise by the 2- and 4-week measurements, i.e. immediately before the next injection was due. Based on the 2- and 4-week measurements, the mean falls in oestradiol levels were 79 and 58% in the anastrozole and formestane groups, respectively (p = 0.0001). More effective and consistent suppression of oestradiol was achieved with anastrozole at the therapeutic dose of 1 mg once daily, orally, than with formestane at the standard dose of 250 mg every 2 weeks, intramuscularly.",1
Randomized phase II study comparing efficacy and safety of combination-therapy trastuzumab and docetaxel vs. sequential therapy of trastuzumab followed by docetaxel alone at progression as first-line chemotherapy in patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer: HERTAX trial.,"BACKGROUND: Because chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is associated with relevant toxicity, sequential monotherapy trastuzumab followed by cytotoxic therapy at disease progression might be an attractive approach. METHODS: In a multicenter phase II trial, 101 patients with overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2(+)) MBC were randomized between combination-therapy trastuzumab (Herceptin) plus docetaxel (H+D) and sequential therapy of single-agent trastuzumab followed at disease progression by docetaxel alone (H→D) as first-line chemotherapy for metastatic disease. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) after completed sequential or combination therapy. RESULTS: For the H+D group the median PFS was 9.4 vs. 9.9 months for the H→D group and 1-year PFS rates were 44% vs. 35%, respectively. However the overall response rates (ORRs) were 79% vs. 53%, respectively (P = .016), and overall survival was 30.5 vs. 19.7 months, respectively (P = .11). In the H→D group, response rates to monotherapy trastuzumab and subsequent docetaxel were 34% and 39%, respectively, with a median PFS during single-agent trastuzumab of 3.9 months. The incidence and severity of neuropathy were significantly higher in the H+D group. Retrospective analysis of trastuzumab treatment beyond progression (applied in 46% of patients in the H+D group and 37% in the H→D group) showed a correlation with longer overall survival in both treatment arms (36.0 vs. 18.0 months and 30.3 vs. 18.6 months, respectively). CONCLUSION: First-line treatment in patients with MBC with H→D resulted in a similar PFS compared with H+D, but the response rate was lower and the overall survival nonsignificantly shorter.",1
Adjuvant cytotoxic and endocrine therapy in pre- and postmenopausal patients with breast cancer and one to nine infiltrated nodes: five-year results of the Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group randomized HE 10/92 study.,"SUMMARY: The present randomized phase III trial was designed to detect a 15% benefit in relapse-free survival (RFS) or overall survival (OS) from the incorporation of adjuvant tamoxifen to the combination of CNF [cyclophosphamide, 500 mg/m2; mitoxantrone (Novantrone), 10 mg/m2; fluorouracil, 500 mg/m2 chemotherapy and ovarian ablation in premenopausal patients with node-positive breast cancer and conversely from the incorporation of CNF chemotherapy to adjuvant tamoxifen in node-positive postmenopausal patients. From April 1992 until March 1998, 456 patients with operable breast cancer and one to nine infiltrated axillary nodes entered the study. Premenopausal patients were treated with six cycles of CNF chemotherapy followed by ovarian ablation with monthly injections of triptoreline 3.75 mg for 1 year (Group A, 84 patients) or the same treatment followed by 5 years of tamoxifen (Group B, 92 patients). Postmenopausal patients received 5 years of tamoxifen (Group C, 145 patients) or 6 cycles of CNF followed by 5 years of tamoxifen (Group D, 135 patients). Adjuvant radiation was administered to all patients with partial mastectomy. After a median follow-up period of 5 years, 125 patients (27%) relapsed and 79 (17%) died. The 5-year actuarial RFS for premenopausal patients was 65% in Group A and 68% in Group B (p = 0.86) and for postmenopausal patients 70% in Group C and 67% in Group D (p = 0.36). Also, the respective OS rates were 77% and 80% (p = 0.68) for premenopausal and 84% and 78% (p = 0.10) for postmenopausal patients. Severe toxicities were infrequently seen, with the exception of leukopenia (18%), among the 311 patients treated with CNF. In conclusion, the present study failed to demonstrate a 15% difference in RFS in favor of node-positive premenopausal patients treated with an additional 5 years of tamoxifen after CNF adjuvant chemotherapy and ovarian ablation. Similarly, six cycles of CNF preceding 5 years of tamoxifen did not translate to a 15% RFS benefit in node-positive postmenopausal patients.",1
"Is adjuvant chemotherapy of benefit for postmenopausal women who receive endocrine treatment for highly endocrine-responsive, node-positive breast cancer? International Breast Cancer Study Group Trials VII and 12-93.","To compare the efficacy of chemoendocrine treatment with that of endocrine treatment (ET) alone for postmenopausal women with highly endocrine responsive breast cancer. In the International Breast Cancer Study Group (IBCSG) Trials VII and 12-93, postmenopausal women with node-positive, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive or ER-negative, operable breast cancer were randomized to receive either chemotherapy or endocrine therapy or combined chemoendocrine treatment. Results were analyzed overall in the cohort of 893 patients with endocrine-responsive disease, and according to prospectively defined categories of ER, age and nodal status. STEPP analyses assessed chemotherapy effect. The median follow-up was 13 years. Adding chemotherapy reduced the relative risk of a disease-free survival event by 19% (P = 0.02) compared with ET alone. STEPP analyses showed little effect of chemotherapy for tumors with high levels of ER expression (P = 0.07), or for the cohort with one positive node (P = 0.03). Chemotherapy significantly improves disease-free survival for postmenopausal women with endocrine-responsive breast cancer, but the magnitude of the effect is substantially attenuated if ER levels are high.",1
Acute monocytic or myelomonocytic leukemia with balanced chromosome translocations to band 11q23 after therapy with 4-epi-doxorubicin and cisplatin or cyclophosphamide for breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: To report five cases of acute monocytic or myelomonocytic leukemia after chemotherapy with 4-epidoxorubicin for breast cancer and to evaluate the risk of leukemia after the use of this drug. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred fifty-seven patients with advanced breast cancer were randomized to either 4-epi-doxorubicin plus cisplatin or 4-epi-doxorubicin alone. An additional 203 patients were treated prospectively with 4-epi-doxorubicin alone. All were observed closely for leukemic complications. RESULTS: Three patients from the randomized study developed leukemia; all were in the subgroup of 74 patients who received 4-epi-doxorubicin plus cisplatin, whereas no leukemia was observed among the remaining 83 patients in the randomized study or among the additional 203 patients who were treated prospectively with 4-epi-doxorubicin alone (P = .023, log-rank test). In the subgroup of 74 patients who were treated with 4-epi-doxorubicin plus cisplatin, the cumulative risk of leukemia was 16.0% +/- 9.9% (mean +/- SE) 33 months after the start of therapy; the relative risk was 668 (95% confidence interval [Cl], 138 to 1,953). Two other cases of acute monocytic and myelomonocytic leukemia were observed after 4-epi-doxorubicin plus alkylating agents were administered for breast cancer. Three of five cases of leukemia presented balanced translocations to chromosome band 11q23 and two, loss of a whole chromosome no. 7 or its long arm. CONCLUSIONS: 4-epi-doxorubicin is leukemogenic, and the leukemias are often acute monocytic or myelomonocytic with balanced chromosome translocations to band 11q23, such as in the leukemias after therapy with the epipodophyllotoxins. Furthermore, our results suggest a synergistic effect in leukemogenesis between 4-epi-doxorubicin targeting DNA-topoisomerase II and directly genotoxic drugs such as cisplatin or alkylating agents.",0
Toxicity of older and younger patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy for node-positive breast cancer: the Cancer and Leukemia Group B Experience.,"PURPOSE: Older node-positive patients treated with newer adjuvant chemotherapy regimens have improvements in relapse-free and overall survival similar to younger patients. We compared toxicity of older and younger patients in three randomized trials of adjuvant chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Toxicity data were available for 93% of 6,642 patients enrolled. The three trials included: Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 8541, a comparison of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil in three dose schedules; CALGB 9344: cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin with or without paclitaxel; and CALGB 9741: cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and paclitaxel every 2 versus every 3 weeks. National Cancer Institute grade 3 to 5 toxicities were compared among age groups. RESULTS: Seven percent of patients (n = 458) were age 65 or older, 3% were 70 or older, 38% were 51 to 64, and 55% were 50 or younger. Twenty-four deaths (0.4%) were attributed to treatment; seven (1.5%) of 486 in patients 65 or older, 10 (0.40%) of 2,480 in patients who were 51 to 64 years, and seven (0.19%) of 3,676 occurred in patients younger than 50. In multivariate analysis, older patients were significantly more likely to have grade 4 hematologic toxicity, to have discontinued treatment for toxicity, or to have died of acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome. There were no significant differences in grade 3 to 4 nonhematologic toxicity. CONCLUSION: Healthy older patients who met the strict eligibility criteria for these trials had a higher rate of hematologic toxicity and treatment-related deaths than younger patients, but no increase in nonhematologic toxicity. Elderly patients treated with newer adjuvant chemotherapy regimens derive the same benefits from newer chemotherapy regimens as younger patients but should be cautioned about the increased risk of toxicity and treatment-related death.",0
Lonidamine significantly increases the activity of epirubicin in patients with advanced breast cancer: results from a multicenter prospective randomized trial.,"PURPOSE: Some evidence in vitro and in vivo shows that lonidamine (LND) can positively modulate the activity of doxorubicin and epirubicin (EPI). On this basis, a multicenter prospective randomized trial was performed in patients with advanced breast cancer (BC) to determine if the addition of LND to EPI could increase the response rate of EPI alone. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From May 1991 to May 1993, 207 patients were enrolled onto this study and randomized to receive intravenous (IV) EPI (60 mg/m2 on days 1 and 2) alone or with LND (600 mg orally daily). EPI administration was repeated every 21 days until tumor progression or for a maximum of eight cycles. LND was administered continuously until chemotherapy withdrawal. RESULTS: Response rate was significantly superior for the EPI plus LND scheme compared with the single-agent EPI either considering assessable patients (60.0% v 39.8%; P < .01) or including all registered patients according to an intention-to-treat analysis (55.3% v 37.5%; P < .02). The distribution of the response rate according to the site of disease did not show any significant difference between the treatment arms, except for the patient subgroup with liver metastases in which the combination EPI plus LND resulted in a significant improvement of responses than EPI alone. Toxicity was moderate, and except for myalgia, no adjunctive side effects were observed in the EPI plus LND arm. Overall survival and time to progression were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: This study confirms in vivo that the administration of EPI is enhanced by the concomitant LND administration.",1
Sequential or alternating administration of docetaxel (Taxotere) combined with FEC in metastatic breast cancer: a randomised phase II trial.,"The aim of this study, using a Fleming single-stage design, was to explore the efficacy and safety of Taxotere 100 x mg x m(-2) docetaxel and FEC 75 cyclophosphamide 500 mg x m(-2), fluorouracil 500 x mg x m(-2) and epirubicin 75 mg x m(-2), in alternating and sequential schedules for the first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer. One hundred and thirty-six women were randomly allocated, to one of three treatment regimens: DTX 100 plus FEC 75, alternated for eight courses (ALT); four courses of DTX 100 followed by four courses of FEC 75 (SEQ T); or four courses of FEC 75 followed by four courses of DTX 100 (SEQ F). One hundred and thirty-one women were evaluable for tumour response. Although the treatment outcome was equivalent in the two sequential arms and the alternating regimen (P=0.110, not significant), the response rate was less encouraging in the SEQ F arm (52.3%) than in the other two arms (71.1% for ALT and 70.5% for SEQ T), in which docetaxel was administered first. Time to progression was similar in the ALT, SEQ T and SEQ F arms (9.5, 9.3 and 10.4 months respectively). Grade 3-4 neutropenia was observed in nearly all patients; febrile neutropenia occurred in 9% (ALT), 16% (SEQ T) and 2% (SEQ F) of patients. Few patients (< or =9%) developed grade 3-4 non-haematological toxicities. Relative dose intensity was 97-99% for all regimens. All treatment regimens were active and well tolerated.",1
"Postoperative dose-dense sequential chemotherapy with epirubicin, paclitaxel and CMF in patients with high-risk breast cancer: safety analysis of the Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group randomized phase III trial HE 10/00.","BACKGROUND: A randomized phase III trial in high-risk breast cancer patients was conducted, to further explore the impact of dose-density in the adjuvant treatment for breast cancer. The safety analysis is presented. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From October 2000 until June 2005, 1121 node-positive patients were randomized to sequential dose-dense epirubicin 110 mg/m(2) and paclitaxel (Taxol, Bristol Myers-Squibb, Princeton, New Jersey, USA) 250 mg/m(2) (group A), or concurrent epirubicin 83 mg/m(2) and paclitaxel 187 mg/m(2) (group B), both followed by three cycles of 'intensified' combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and fluorouracil (CMF). Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was given prophylactically with the dose-dense treatments. RESULTS: Median dose intensity of epirubicin and paclitaxel was double in group A, as designed, with significantly less cycles administered at full dose (P < 0.001). Median cumulative dose of all drugs and total treatment duration, however, were identical between groups. Severe taxane-related toxic effects were more frequent in group A, while severe thrombocytopenia was low and present only in group A. There were no differences in the rates of other hematological toxic effects, including febrile neutropenia. The rates of secondary malignancies were low. CONCLUSION: Both regimens as used in the present study are well tolerated and safe. The rates of severe taxane-related toxic effects and thrombocytopenia, although low overall, are significantly increased with the dose-dense sequential regimen.",1
Effects of chan-chuang qigong on improving symptom and psychological distress in chemotherapy patients.,"The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of Chan-Chuang qigong on symptoms distress and psychological distress of breast cancer patients who underwent chemotherapy. A quasi-experimental design was adopted. Subjects were recruited from breast cancer outpatients receiving chemotherapy at an 1800-bed medical center in Taipei, Taiwan. Of these subjects, 35 were assigned to the control group and 32 to the experimental group in which Chan-Chuang qigong was administered. Assignment was not random. The instruments included a 21-item symptom distress scale and psychological distress with the symptom checklist-90-revised. Data of the symptoms and psychological distress were collected on the day before chemotherapy as baseline values, and also collected on days 8, 15 and 22 of chemotherapy. The results showed that the overall severity of symptom distress in the experimental group was significantly lower than the control group on day 22 (p < 0.05). The symptoms with significant improvement included pain, numbness, heartburn and dizziness (p < 0.05). With regard to psychological distress, the difference of overall severity between the two groups was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). However, the items of ""unwillingness to live"" (p < 0.05) and ""hopelessness about the future"" (p < 0.05) were significantly improved in the experimental group. In conclusion, Chan-Chuang qigong had the effect of attenuating the symptom distress and probably some part of the psychological distress of chemotherapy patients.",0
"Adjuvant chemohormonal therapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil (CAF) with or without medroxyprogesterone acetate for node-positive breast cancer patients.","BACKGROUND: The Comprehensive Cancer Center trial 82-01 is a prospective randomized study to investigate the value of the addition of high-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) to chemotherapy in patients with node-positive operable breast cancer. MPA may be of advantage in this setting because of its activity in estrogen receptor ER-positive as well as ER-negative tumors and since it may protect against chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression and thus enable maintenance of the appropriate chemotherapeutic scheduling. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred eight evaluable patients with node-positive (N+) operable breast cancer (T1-3, N1) were entered in a multicenter randomized trial. Two hundred nine patients were randomized in the MPA- arm and 199 in the MPA+ arm. CAF chemotherapy was given as a short i.v. bolus infusion: cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 i.v. day 1, doxorubicin 40 mg/m2 i.v. day 1, and 5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 i.v. day 1, q 4 wks x 6. MPA was given intramuscularly (i.m.) 500 mg q d x 28 days, followed by 500 mg i.m. twice weekly during 5 months. RESULTS: The main side effects of MPA were weight gain with a mean of 5.5 kg as opposed to 1.8 kg in the control group (p = 0.01) and vaginal bleeding in 30/199 in the MPA+ group and 0 in the MPA- group. MPA ameliorated vomiting grade III, IV (45% vs. 28%, p < 0.001), nausea grade III, IV (50% vs. 34%, p < 0.001) and leucocyte nadir grade III, IV (20% vs. 11%, p = 0.003). Disease-free survival (DFS) after 5 years was 59% in the MPA+ and 49% in the MPA- group (p = 0.12). Patients > or = 60 years benefitted most from MPA treatment, in particular if freedom from distant metastases was taken as the endpoint (p = 0.02). Overall survival (OS) was not significantly different between the two treatment groups (p = 0.18), but within subgroups analysed there was an advantage for MPA+ in patients > or = 55 years (p = 0.002) and in pT1 patients (p = 0.045). CONCLUSIONS: High-dose MPA ameliorates CAF side effects and reduces the risk of metastatic disease, especially in elderly breast cancer patients.",1
Effects of tamoxifen on bone mineral density in postmenopausal women with breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Tamoxifen, a synthetic antiestrogen, increases disease-free and overall survival when used as adjuvant therapy for primary breast cancer. Because it is given for long periods, it is important to know whether tamoxifen affects the skeleton, particularly since it is used extensively in postmenopausal women who are at risk for osteoporosis. Using photon absorptiometry, we studied the effects of tamoxifen on the bone mineral density of the lumbar spine and radius and on biochemical measures of bone metabolism in 140 postmenopausal women with axillary-node-negative breast cancer, in a two-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. RESULTS: In the women given tamoxifen, the mean bone mineral density of the lumbar spine increased by 0.61 percent per year, whereas in those given placebo it decreased by 1.00 percent per year (P less than 0.001). Radial bone mineral density decreased to the same extent in both groups. In a subgroup randomly selected from each group, serum osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase concentrations decreased significantly in women given tamoxifen (P less than 0.001 for each variable), whereas serum parathyroid hormone and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations did not change significantly in either group. CONCLUSIONS: In postmenopausal women, treatment with tamoxifen is associated with preservation of the bone mineral density of the lumbar spine. Whether this favorable effect on bone mineral density is accompanied by a decrease in the risk of fractures remains to be determined.",0
Adjuvant chemotherapy for premenopausal breast cancer: a meta-analysis using quality-adjusted survival.,"PURPOSE: Adjuvant chemotherapy for early breast cancer has been shown to offer an improvement in recurrence-free and overall survival, especially for younger women, but the acute toxic effects of this treatment discourage some physicians from prescribing it. The purpose of this analysis was to determine whether the benefit of 6 months of adjuvant CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil) treatment outweighs its costs in terms of toxic effects. METHODS: A meta-analysis of quality-adjusted survival was performed based on data from 1229 patients, aged 49 years or younger, randomized in eight trials comparing CMF versus no adjuvant systemic therapy. The eight trials were included in the worldwide overview conducted by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group. The Q-TWiST method was used in a meta-analysis that provided treatment comparisons incorporating differences in quality of life associated with the amount of time patients spend with subjective toxic effects, after relapse, and without symptoms of relapse. RESULTS: Within 6 years of follow-up evaluation for patients with node-positive disease, the benefit in terms of increased relapse-free and overall survival balanced the costs in terms of acute toxic side effects. This was true even for the extreme case in which a zero value was assigned to all 6 months during which patients might receive adjuvant CMF chemotherapy. Within 10 years of follow-up evaluation, treated patients gained an average of 1.5 years of relapse-free survival time, almost 1 year of overall survival time, and 1 year of time without symptoms and toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant chemotherapy for younger women with node-positive breast cancer provided substantial amounts of quality-adjusted survival time, even after accounting for costs associated with toxic effects of the treatment. The Q-TWiST method represents a valuable tool for comparing treatments because it incorporates patients' perceptions of their quality of life for therapeutic decision-making.",0
Investigations on cell-mediated immunity in patients with breast and ovarian carcinomas receiving a combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy with thymopentin.,"In 78 patients with breast and 37 patients with ovarian cancer the effect of combined chemo- and immunotherapy with thymopentin (Timunox, Cilag) on different parameters of cell-mediated immunity (leukocyte migration inhibition test, serum level of TNF-alpha, IL-1, interferon-alpha, distribution of lymphocyte subsets) and the clinical course of disease was evaluated and compared to patients receiving only chemotherapy. In cancer patients additionally treated with thymopentin an increase in reactivity in the LMI test and an increase of IFN-alpha serum levels could be observed, whereas serum levels of TNF-alpha and IL-2 and the distribution of T-helper, T-suppressor, total T and natural killer cells did not change. Concerning the clinical course of disease, no significant differences could be observed in patients with disseminated spread of disease, whereas in patients receiving combined chemo-immunotherapy in the course of an adjuvant treatment a benefit was found compared to those receiving only chemotherapy. Thus, it seems that the additional administration of thymopentin in breast and ovarian cancer patients under chemotherapy results in a reduction of immunosuppressive side effects of chemotherapy and a positive effect of the survival time in patients with limited spread of disease.",0
The effect of exemestane or tamoxifen on markers of bone turnover: results of a German sub-study of the Tamoxifen Exemestane Adjuvant Multicentre (TEAM) trial.,"Adjuvant treatment of breast cancer with aromatase inhibitors has been associated with increased bone loss. In this study, postmenopausal patients with oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer were randomised to exemestane for 5 years or tamoxifen for 2-2.5 years, followed by exemestane for 2-2.5 years. Levels of bone formation markers (bone specific alkaline phosphatase, amino terminal propeptide of type I procollagen, osteocalcin), and the bone resorption marker (carboxyterminal crosslinked telopeptide of type I collagen), were assessed at baseline and after 3, 6 and 12 months of treatment. Exemestane (n=78) resulted in increases from baseline in all bone turnover marker levels at all timepoints. In contrast, levels of all bone marker turnovers decreased with tamoxifen (n=83). Differences between tamoxifen and exemestane were statistically significant for all bone turnover markers at all timepoints. In conclusion, exemestane results in increases in markers of bone formation and resorption, while decreases are observed with tamoxifen.",0

Assessment of five serum marker assays in patients with advanced breast cancer treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate.,"This study concerns five different tumour marker assays examined in the context of 94 patients with advanced breast cancer treated in a prospectively randomised trial of different doses of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). MPA was administered at doses of 500 or 1000 mg daily and clinical evaluation of patients was carried out according to UICC criteria. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was selected as a standard marker, with three assays for MUC1 mucins (epithelial mucin core antigens (EMCA), EMCA2 and BR-MA immunoradiometric assay) differing in antibody specificities for different mucin epitopes. An additional novel assay for soluble cytokeratin was also evaluated as an example of an independent marker with a different nature and biology. Sensitivity of individual assays ranged between 44 (EMCA2) and 69% (cytokeratin) and the use of two assays in combination led to sensitivities as high as 84% (cytokeratin+BR-MA). The proportion of patients found to be assessable by each assay ranged between 51 (EMCA2) and 76% (cytokeratin). Of those patients whose marker changes were assessable, those receiving the higher dose of MPA displayed significant falls in marker levels after 12 weeks of treatment. This effect was not observed in patients receiving 500 mg. The change in cytokeratin levels in patients undergoing high dose MPA therapy proved to be most marked. Using the cytokeratin assay, 91% (of 23 patients) of patients with progressive disease showed at least a 25% rise in serum marker levels. Of these, 66% showed increases before disease progression was detected clinically with a mean lead time of 14 weeks. There was very little difference between the responses of the five tumour marker assays in patients with stable or responding disease, the proportion of these patients with stable or falling tumour marker levels ranging between 58% (CEA) and 77% (EMCA). We conclude that the cytokeratin assay has an application in monitoring response to therapy and predicting tumour progression in advanced breast cancer patients with assessable tumour marker profiles, especially if used in combination with a MUC1 mucin assay.",0
Prognostic and predictive impact of soluble epidermal growth factor receptor (sEGFR) protein in the serum of patients treated with chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: A soluble fragment of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) extracellular domain (sEGFR) can be detected in the serum of cancer patients, but the role of sEGFR is still unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples from patients receiving chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer were collected before (n = 101) and after 3 courses of therapy (n=39). Levels of sEGFR and serum HER-2/neu extracellular domain (ECD) were determined by standardized ELISA. RESULTS: A higher percentage of cancer patients (15%) showed sEGFR values below 45ng/mL compared with control subjects (3%, p<0.001). Patients with sEGFR levels below 45 ng/mL showed a trend towards shorter overall survival (median 11.7 versus 15.4 months, p=0.08), which was more pronounced in patients with estrogen receptor-positive primary tumors (median 9.6 versus 15.4 months, p=0.022) Patients with low sEGFR and elevated serum HER-2/neu ECD (>15 ng/mL) also showed a shorter overall survival than those with normal values for both parameters (7.1 versus 15.4 months, p=0.03). Again, this difference was higher in patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors (4.6 versus 15.4 month, p<0.0001). During treatment, a decrease of sEGFR levels occurred in 74.4% of the patients (p=0.014). CONCLUSION: Low sEGFR levels in patients with metastatic breast cancer are associated with a shorter overall survival, particularly in patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors. Chemotherapy frequently induces a decrease of sEGFR. The combined, determination of sEGFR and serum HER-2/neu ECD also delivers relevant information. These findings suggest that the sEGFR status in metastatic breast cancer could be of clinical relevance.",0
"Zoledronic acid versus pamidronate in the treatment of skeletal metastases in patients with breast cancer or osteolytic lesions of multiple myeloma: a phase III, double-blind, comparative trial.","PURPOSE: Zoledronic acid, a new and more potent bisphosphonate, was compared with pamidronate, the current standard treatment for patients with osteolytic or mixed bone metastases/lesions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 1,648 patients with either Durie-Salmon stage III multiple myeloma or advanced breast cancer and at least one bone lesion were randomly assigned to treatment with either 4 or 8 mg of zoledronic acid via 15-minute intravenous infusion or 90 mg of pamidronate via 2-hour intravenous infusion every 3 to 4 weeks for 12 months. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients experiencing at least one skeletal-related event over 13 months. RESULTS: The proportion of patients with at least one skeletal-related event was similar in all treatment groups. Median time to the first skeletal-related eventwas approximately 1 year in each treatment group. The skeletal morbidity rate was slightly lower in patients treated with zoledronic acid than in those treated with pamidronate, and zoledronic acid (4 mg) significantly decreased the incidence and event rate for radiation therapy to bone, both overall and in breast cancer patients receiving hormonal therapy. Pain scores decreased in all treatment groups in the presence of stable or decreased analgesic use. Zoledronic acid (4 mg) and pamidronate were equally well tolerated; the most common adverse events were bone pain, nausea, fatigue, and fever and < 5% of serious adverse events were related to the study drug. The incidence of renal impairment among patients treated with 4 mg of zoledronic acid via 15-minute infusion was similar to that among patients treated with pamidronate. CONCLUSIONS: Zoledronic acid (4 mg) via 15-minute intravenous infusion was as effective and well tolerated as 90 mg of pamidronate in the treatment of osteolytic and mixed bone metastases/lesions in patients with advanced breast cancer or multiple myeloma.

Differential response of triple-negative breast cancer to a docetaxel and carboplatin-based neoadjuvant treatment.,"BACKGROUND: In this study, the authors evaluated whether a pathologic complete response (pCR) or a clinical complete response (cCR) to neoadjuvant treatment in patients with locally advanced breast cancer differed among the 3 subtypes of breast cancer: triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer, and hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer. Whether a cCR or a pCR was correlated with fewer recurrences and better survival also was investigated. METHODS: Patients with stage II/III breast cancer received 4 cycles of neoadjuvant docetaxel and carboplatin (TC) every 3 weeks. Patients with HER2-positive tumors were randomized to receive either additional weekly trastuzumab preoperatively or TC alone. Postoperatively, all patients received 4 cycles of TC, and all HER2-positive patients received a total of 52 weeks of trastuzumab. The recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates at 2 years were reported. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients were enrolled, including 11 patients with TNBC, 30 patients with HER2-positive tumors, and 33 patients with hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative tumor. The cCR rates were 45.4%, 50% and 40.6% in TNBC, HER2-positive, and hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative groups, respectively. The pCR rate for the entire group was 26.8%, and patients with TNBC had the best response (54.6%) followed by patients with HER2-positive tumors (24.1%) and patients with hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative tumors (19.4%; P = .0126). The pCR rate for patients with HER2-positive tumors improved from 7% to 40% if trastuzumab was added (P = .08). Infiltrating ductal cancer, TNBC, negative estrogen receptor and/or progesterone receptor status, tumor classification predicted a pCR (P ≤ .05). Multivariate analysis using a logistic regression test indicated that tumor type was an independent predictor. The RFS rate for patients who did versus patients who did not achieve a pCR was 93.8% versus 78.4% at 2 years, respectively, and 83.3% versus 58% at 3 years, respectively (P = .1227); whereas, for patients who did versus patients who did not achieve a cCR, the RFS rate was 80.9% versus 83.9%, respectively, at 2 years and 65% versus 64.3%, respectively, at 3 years (P = .999). CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that the TC combination is promising for the treatment of TNBC. The addition of trastuzumab to TC improved the pCR rate significantly in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer.",1
Risk-benefit profile for raloxifene: 4-year data From the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation (MORE) randomized trial.,"UNLABELLED: Posthoc analysis of the MORE osteoporosis treatment trial assessed risk-benefit profile of raloxifene in 7705 postmenopausal women. A major disease outcomes global index resulted in annual rates of 1.39% and 1.83% in the raloxifene and placebo groups, respectively (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.62-0.92), compatible with a favorable risk-benefit profile for raloxifene for treating postmenopausal osteoporosis. INTRODUCTION: The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) trial reported overall risks that exceeded benefits from use of estrogen-progestin in healthy postmenopausal women. The objective of this posthoc analysis of the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation (MORE) trial was to assess the safety profile of raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator indicated for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, using the global index method from the WHI trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 7705 postmenopausal women (mean age, 67 years) were enrolled in the MORE osteoporosis treatment trial and randomly assigned to receive placebo or one of two doses of raloxifene (60 or 120 mg/day) for 4 years. A global index of clinical outcomes, defined as described for the WHI trial (the earliest occurrence of coronary heart disease, stroke, pulmonary embolism, invasive breast cancer, endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death because of other causes) was applied to the MORE trial data. Physicians blinded to treatment assignment adjudicated events. Intention-to-treat survival analysis of time-to-first-event was performed using a proportional hazards model. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The annualized rate of global index events was 1.83% in the placebo group and 1.39% in the combined raloxifene dose groups (hazard ratio [HR], 0.75; 95% CI, 0.62-0.92). Analyzing individual dose groups separately yielded the same results (HR for 60 mg/day, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.60-0.96: HR for 120 mg/day, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.59-0.95). Subgroup analyses showed no significant interactions between age or hysterectomy status and the effect of raloxifene on the global index (interaction p > 0.1), whereas the global index risk reduction seemed to be greater in obese women compared with nonobese women (interaction p = 0.03). The significant 25% reduction in global index is compatible with a favorable risk-benefit safety profile when raloxifene is used for osteoporosis treatment in postmenopausal women. These results require confirmation in ongoing clinical trials.",0
Adjuvant chemotherapy followed by goserelin versus either modality alone for premenopausal lymph node-negative breast cancer: a randomized trial.,"BACKGROUND: Although chemotherapy and ovarian function suppression are both effective adjuvant therapies for patients with early-stage breast cancer, little is known of the efficacy of their sequential combination. In an International Breast Cancer Study Group (IBCSG) randomized clinical trial (Trial VIII) for pre- and perimenopausal women with lymph node-negative breast cancer, we compared sequential chemotherapy followed by the gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist goserelin with each modality alone. METHODS: From March 1990 through October 1999, 1063 patients stratified by estrogen receptor (ER) status and radiotherapy plan were randomly assigned to receive goserelin for 24 months (n = 346), six courses of ""classical"" CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil) chemotherapy (n = 360), or six courses of classical CMF followed by 18 months of goserelin (CMF --> goserelin; n = 357). A fourth arm (no adjuvant treatment) with 46 patients was discontinued in 1992. Tumors were classified as ER-negative (30%), ER-positive (68%), or ER status unknown (3%). Twenty percent of patients were aged 39 years or younger. The median follow-up was 7 years. The primary outcome was disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS: Patients with ER-negative tumors achieved better disease-free survival if they received CMF (5-year DFS for CMF = 84%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 77% to 91%; 5-year DFS for CMF --> goserelin = 88%, 95% CI = 82% to 94%) than if they received goserelin alone (5-year DFS = 73%, 95% CI = 64% to 81%). By contrast, for patients with ER-positive disease, chemotherapy alone and goserelin alone provided similar outcomes (5-year DFS for both treatment groups = 81%, 95% CI = 76% to 87%), whereas sequential therapy (5-year DFS = 86%, 95% CI = 82% to 91%) provided a statistically nonsignificant improvement compared with either modality alone, primarily because of the results among younger women. CONCLUSIONS: Premenopausal women with ER-negative (i.e., endocrine nonresponsive), lymph node-negative breast cancer should receive adjuvant chemotherapy. For patients with ER-positive (i.e., endocrine responsive) disease, the combination of chemotherapy with ovarian function suppression or other endocrine agents, and the use of endocrine therapy alone should be studied.",1
Deterioration of quality of life of high-risk breast cancer patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy: the PEGASE 01 Quality of Life Study.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the quality of life (QOL) of high-risk breast cancer patients included in a randomized clinical trial (PEGASE 01) comparing conventional chemotherapy versus adding an additional high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) cycle with blood stem cell support. METHODS: A total of 314 patients were included in the clinical trial. QOL evaluations were available for 199 patients. QOL was assessed over a 1-year follow-up period, using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C-30. The results were analyzed using a linear mixed-effects model. RESULTS: Toxicity of HDC has a strong negative impact on patients' QOL during the treatment phase. This negative impact tended to last longer in the HDC group, as for most of the QLQ-C30 scales, the QOL scores of HDC patients tend to improve at a slower rate than that of patients receiving standard chemotherapy. In particular, physical functioning remains deteriorated 1 year after inclusion for HDC patients comparatively to conventional chemotherapy patients (85.99 vs. 76.65, P = 0.021), and the pain score was still higher in the HDC group at that time (28.32 vs. 15.97, P = 0.004). CONCLUSION: HDC has a negative impact on QOL even after treatment phase. In the absence of an overall survival benefit of using HDC for high-risk breast cancer patients, QOL studies with a longer follow-up play an important role in informing the complex trade-off implied by HDC between higher toxicity, reduced risk of relapse, and QOL decrease after the active phase of treatment.",0
Exemestane as adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer: intergroup exemestane study/tamoxifen exemestane adjuvant multicenter trials.,"This review summarizes the status of 2 major clinical trials involving exemestane, a nonsteroidal inactivator of aromatase. The first trial, Intergroup Exemestane Study (IES), has been previously reported. More than 4700 postmenopausal women were randomized to receive exemestane versus continued tamoxifen at 2-3 years into 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen. In the hormone receptor-positive group, there was a one-third improvement in disease-free survival and a near survival advantage (P = 0.08) for the crossover strategy. The second trial is the Tamoxifen Exemestane Adjuvant Multicenter (TEAM) study. Recently, the design was modified to take into account the information from the IES. In the initial phase of TEAM, 7000 patients were randomized to receive 5 years of exemestane versus 5 years of tamoxifen. With the IES results, TEAM was modified so that 5 years of exemestane would be compared with 5 years of tamoxifen crossed over to exemestane. An additional 2500 patients have now been accrued. Updates of the IES and the first report of the TEAM might be available in 2006. The implications of these studies are discussed in this article.",0
Adjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of breast cancer: results of a multicentre study.,248 patients with locally radically treated early breast cancer (196 node-positive) were randomized post-operatively between 6 courses of a 'CMF like' chemotherapy and no further treatment. Results (with a minimum of 5 years follow-up on every patient) favour chemotherapy with a significant increase in the median time to recurrence from 31 to 50 months for all patients (P = 0.04) and from 26 to 49 months for node-positive patients (P = 0.023). No significant effect on survival is seen although there is a trend towards longer survival in the treated group. The regimen used was relatively non-toxic when compared to the traditional CMF with 34% of patients experiencing mild nausea and vomiting immediately post-injection and only 11% complaining of more severe nausea and vomiting. Because of this lower toxicity the treatment was found to be amenable to administration in both regional hospitals and specialized centres.,1
"Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of sertraline (Zoloft) for the treatment of hot flashes in women with early stage breast cancer taking tamoxifen.","We observed the relief of hot flashes in breast cancer survivors taking tamoxifen and treated with sertraline for depression. Our objective was to assess the effect of sertraline on the frequency and severity of hot flashes, mood status, and health-related quality of life. We used a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study using 6 weeks of sertraline (50 mg each morning) versus placebo. Study participants were 62 breast cancer survivors from an oncology clinic in a tertiary care center on adjuvant tamoxifen reporting bothersome hot flashes. Patients were asked to keep a daily hot flash diary to record hot flash frequency and severity, from which hot flash scores (frequency x severity) were calculated. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies depression scale and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy--Breast (FACT-B) (at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks) were used to assess mood and quality of life. Sixty-two women were accrued. Forty-seven women (median age 53.9 years, range 36.6-77.1 years; 89% postmenopausal; 85.5% Caucasian) completed the first 6 weeks and 39 completed 12 weeks. The baseline daily hot flash frequency and score were 5.8 (standard deviation 4.1) and 11.5 (14.0), respectively. At the end of the first 6 weeks, hot flash frequency decreased by 50% in 36% of those taking sertraline compared to 27% taking placebo. In the crossover analysis, sertraline was significantly more effective than placebo: women crossing from placebo to sertraline had a decrease (-0.9 and -1.7) in hot flash frequency and score, whereas those crossing from sertraline to placebo had an increase (1.5 and 3.4) in hot flash frequency and score (p = 0.03 and 0.03). Forty-eight percent preferred the sertraline period, 11% preferred the placebo period, and 41% had no preference (p = 0.006). Measures of depression and quality of life were within normal range and did not change significantly within treatment groups. Sertraline decreases hot flashes in breast cancer survivors taking tamoxifen and women prefer sertraline to placebo. Further study of sertraline for the management of hot flashes is warranted.",0
An open-label dose comparison study of ondansetron for the prevention of emesis associated with chemotherapy prior to bone marrow transplantation.,"Nausea and vomiting are significant side effects in bone marrow transplant (BMT) patients who receive high-dose preparative regimens. Higher than conventional ondansetron doses and continuous infusion might improve emetic control, because of the high doses and combinations of chemotherapy (CT) used in this setting. Our objective was to conduct a prospective, randomized study comparing two different administration methods of high-dose ondansetron during a BMT preparative regimen in breast cancer patients. Patients were eligible if they were nonpregnant women over 18 but under 65 years of age, undergoing highly emetogenic CT in preparation for autologous BMT. All patients received ondansetron as an intermittent (INT = 24 mg i.v. q 12 h/day) or continuous intravenous infusion (CIV = 8 mg i.v. loading dose followed by a continuous infusion of 2 mg/h per day). A total of 66 patients were enrolled in the study (n = 34, INT; n = 32, CIV). There was no statistical difference between treatment groups in the worst grade of emesis for the entire study period (P = 0.49). Greater than 90% of all patients were graded as failures (> or = 5 emetic episodes or need for rescue antiemetics). Complete control (no vomiting episodes) and complete plus major control (1-2 emetic episodes) per day ranged from 8% to 85% and 11% to 91%, respectively. There was no significant difference between the treatment arms in: grade of emesis, episodes of vomiting and retching, nausea scores, and mean number of rescue medications administered. There were no differences in efficacy when high-dose ondansetron was given as CIV or INT for the control of nausea and vomiting in breast cancer patients undergoing high-dose CT for autologous BMT. Ondansetron alone was not adequate to provide sustained control of CT-induced nausea and vomiting over the entire 5-day study period. A combination of antiemetics targeting various mechanisms of CT-induced nausea and vomiting may be necessary to improve response rates.",0
Class III beta-tubulin isotype predicts response in advanced breast cancer patients randomly treated either with single-agent doxorubicin or docetaxel.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the role of microtubule-associated variables as potential predictors of response and clinical outcome in patients with advanced breast cancer receiving single-agent docetaxel or doxorubicin chemotherapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The analysis was done on 173 tumor samples from patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have participated in the TAX-303 phase III trial in which patients were randomly assigned to receive docetaxel or doxorubicin. Expression of total alpha- and beta-tubulin, classes II to IV beta-tubulin isotypes, and tau protein was evaluated by immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors from the primary breast cancer. RESULTS: We observed that patients with ""high"" expression of class III beta-tubulin isotype had a higher probability of response to docetaxel than to doxorubicin treatment (odds ratio, 1.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-3.7; P = 0.05). No difference was observed in terms of time to progression or in terms of overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the superiority of docetaxel over doxorubicin seems to be confined to the subgroup of patients with ""high"" expression of class III beta-tubulin isotype.",0
Fatigue and relating factors in high-risk breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant standard or high-dose chemotherapy: a longitudinal study.,"PURPOSE: Determine whether standard or high-dose chemotherapy leads to changes in fatigue, hemoglobin (Hb), mental health, muscle and joint pain, and menopausal status from pre- to post-treatment and to evaluate whether fatigue is associated with these factors in disease-free breast cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight hundred eighty-five patients were randomly assigned between two chemotherapy regimens both followed by radiotherapy and tamoxifen. Fatigue was assessed using vitality scale (score < or = 46 defined as fatigue), poor mental health using mental health scale (score < or = 56 defined as poor mental health) both of Short-Form 36, muscle and joint pain with Rotterdam Symptom Checklist, and Hb levels were assessed before and 1, 2, and 3 years after chemotherapy. RESULTS: Fatigue was reported in 20% of 430 assessable patients (202 standard-dose, 228 high-dose) with at least a 3-year follow-up, without change over time or difference between treatment arms. Mean Hb levels were lower following high-dose chemotherapy. Only 5% of patients experienced fatigue and anemia. Mental health score was the strongest fatigue predictor at all assessment moments. Menopausal status had no effect on fatigue. Linear mixed effect models showed that the higher the Hb level (P = .0006) and mental health score (P < .0001), the less fatigue was experienced. Joint (P < .0001) and muscle pain (P = .0283) were associated with more fatigue. CONCLUSION: In 3 years after treatment, no significant differences in fatigue were found between standard and high-dose chemotherapy. Fatigue did not change over time. The strongest fatigue predictor was poor mental health.",0
A randomized clinical trial evaluating sequential methotrexate and fluorouracil in the treatment of patients with node-negative breast cancer who have estrogen-receptor-negative tumors.,"We evaluated the postoperative use of sequential methotrexate and fluorouracil followed by leucovorin in 679 patients with primary breast cancer, histologically negative axillary nodes, and estrogen-receptor-negative (less than 10 fmol) tumors. No survival advantage was observed with this therapy as compared with no postoperative therapy during four years of follow-up (87 percent vs. 86 percent; P = 0.8). However, there was a significant prolongation of disease-free survival among women who received this therapy as compared with those who did not (80 percent vs. 71 percent; P = 0.003). An advantage was observed in both the patients less than or equal to 49 years old and those greater than or equal to 50. At four years, treatment failure was reduced by 24 percent in the younger group and by 50 percent in the older group. The rates of both local and regional and distant metastases were decreased. These benefits, achieved without the use of an alkylating agent, were associated with tolerable side effects. Multivariate analysis testing for potential interactions failed to identify subgroups of patients who did not benefit from the therapy. These results, although promising, do not obviate the need for additional trials to evaluate potentially better regimens of therapy, but they do suggest that sequential methotrexate-fluorouracil should be used in the control arm in such studies. Their use is also justified for the treatment of patients who refuse to participate in clinical trials, provided the patients meet the eligibility criteria of the present study. Since women with tumors too small for conventional analysis of estrogen-receptor and progesterone-receptor concentrations were not included in this study, we do not recommend systemic treatment for them outside of a clinical trial.",1
Improved outcomes from adding sequential Paclitaxel but not from escalating Doxorubicin dose in an adjuvant chemotherapy regimen for patients with node-positive primary breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: This study was designed to determine whether increasing the dose of doxorubicin in or adding paclitaxel to a standard adjuvant chemotherapy regimen for breast cancer patients would prolong time to recurrence and survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: After surgical treatment, 3,121 women with operable breast cancer and involved lymph nodes were randomly assigned to receive a combination of cyclophosphamide (C), 600 mg/m(2), with one of three doses of doxorubicin (A), 60, 75, or 90 mg/m(2), for four cycles followed by either no further therapy or four cycles of paclitaxel at 175 mg/m(2). Tamoxifen was given to 94% of patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors. RESULTS: There was no evidence of a doxorubicin dose effect. At 5 years, disease-free survival was 69%, 66%, and 67% for patients randomly assigned to 60, 75, and 90 mg/m(2), respectively. The hazard reductions from adding paclitaxel to CA were 17% for recurrence (adjusted Wald chi(2) P =.0023; unadjusted Wilcoxon P =.0011) and 18% for death (adjusted P =.0064; unadjusted P =.0098). At 5 years, the disease-free survival (+/- SE) was 65% (+/- 1) and 70% (+/- 1), and overall survival was 77% (+/- 1) and 80% (+/- 1) after CA alone or CA plus paclitaxel, respectively. The effects of adding paclitaxel were not significantly different in subsets defined by the protocol, but in an unplanned subset analysis, the hazard ratio of CA plus paclitaxel versus CA alone was 0.72 (95% confidence interval, 0.59 to 0.86) for those with estrogen receptor-negative tumors and only 0.91 (95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 1.07) for patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors, almost all of whom received adjuvant tamoxifen. The additional toxicity from adding four cycles of paclitaxel was generally modest. CONCLUSION: The addition of four cycles of paclitaxel after the completion of a standard course of CA improves the disease-free and overall survival of patients with early breast cancer.",1
Cognitive behavioral therapy and physical exercise for climacteric symptoms in breast cancer patients experiencing treatment-induced menopause: design of a multicenter trial.,"BACKGROUND: Premature menopause is a major concern of younger women undergoing adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. Hormone replacement therapy is contraindicated in women with a history of breast cancer. Non-hormonal medications show a range of bothersome side-effects. There is growing evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and physical exercise can have a positive impact on symptoms in naturally occurring menopause. The objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of these interventions among women with breast cancer experiencing treatment-induced menopause. METHODS/DESIGN: In a randomized, controlled, multicenter trial, we are evaluating the effectiveness of CBT/relaxation, of physical exercise and of these two program elements combined, in reducing menopausal symptoms, improving sexual functioning, reducing emotional distress, and in improving the health-related quality of life of younger breast cancer patients who experience treatment-induced menopause. 325 breast cancer patients (aged < 50) are being recruited from hospitals in the Amsterdam region, and randomly allocated to one of the three treatment groups or a 'waiting list' control group. Self-administered questionnaires are completed by the patients at baseline, and at 12 weeks (T1) and 6 months (T2) post-study entry. Upon completion of the study, women assigned to the control group will be given the choice of undergoing either the CBT or physical exercise program. DISCUSSION: Cognitive behavioral therapy and physical exercise are potentially useful treatments among women with breast cancer undergoing treatment-induced, premature menopause. For these patients, hormonal and non-hormonal therapies are contraindicated or have a range of bothersome side-effects. Hence, research into these interventions is needed, before dissemination and implementation in the current health care system can take place.",0
"Multicenter, randomized, cross-over clinical trial of venlafaxine versus gabapentin for the management of hot flashes in breast cancer survivors.","PURPOSE: Nonhormonal pharmacologic interventions are recommended for the treatment of hot flashes in breast cancer survivors. Antidepressants and gabapentin have been shown to be both effective and well tolerated; however, it is not clear which is preferred.PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a group-sequential, open-label, randomized, cross-over trial of 4 weeks of venlafaxine (37.5 mg daily for 7 days followed by 75 mg daily for 21 days) versus gabapentin (300 mg once per day for 3 days, then 300 mg twice per day for 3 days, then 300 mg three times per day for 22 days), with patient preference as the primary outcome. Postmenopausal women with at least 14 bothersome hot flashes per week for the prior month were eligible. A 2-week baseline period and a 2-week tapering/washout time was used before the first and second treatment periods, respectively. Diaries were used to measure hot flashes and potential toxicities throughout the study. Participants completed a preference questionnaire at the end of the study. A predefined Pocock stopping rule was applied. Patient preference and hot flash and toxicity outcomes were compared between treatments.RESULTS: Sixty-six patients were randomly assigned, 56 of whom provided a preference (eight dropped out and two had no preference); 18 (32%) preferred gabapentin and 38 (68%) preferred venlafaxine (P = .01). Both agents reduced hot flash scores to a similar extent (66% reduction). Venlafaxine was associated with increased nausea, appetite loss, constipation, and reduced negative mood changes compared with gabapentin, whereas gabapentin was associated with increased dizziness and appetite compared with venlafaxine (all P < .05).CONCLUSION: Breast cancer survivors prefer venlafaxine over gabapentin for treating hot flashes.",0
Controlled clinical study on the use of dichloromethylene diphosphonate in patients with breast carcinoma metastasizing to the skeleton.,"Thirty-eight normocalcemic patients with bone metastases from breast carcinoma were randomized to receive dichloromethylene diphosphonate (CL2MDP) in addition to their specific antitumor treatment (chemotherapy and/or hormone therapy), at a dose of 300 mg/day/i.v. or placebo for the first 7 dys. The CL2MDP treatment then continued at a dose of 100 mg day/i.m. for 3 weeks and finally at 100 mg i.m. on alternate days for at least another 2 months. In both groups of patients there was a reduction in the intensity of pain (Scott-Huskisson analog), but there was a more frequent reduction in the daily consumption of analgesics in patients treated with CL2MDP (p = 0.02). Unlike the controls, the patients who received CL2MDP presented a significant reduction in urinary calcium (p = 0.003) and in hydroxyproline (p = 0.05) on the 7th day. As regards the clinical evolution, negative events such as the appearance of hypercalcemia, pathological fractures, new bone lesions or a substantial increase in the preexisting ones, were observed in 9 of the 12 evaluable patients treated with placebo and in 3 out of 9 treated with CL2MDP. Thickening of the preexisting osteolytic lesions was reported in 2 patients treated with CL2MDP. Tolerance was excellent: only a few patients complained of pain at the intramuscular drug injection site.",0
"Carminomycin versus doxorubicin in advanced breast cancer, a randomized phase II study of the E.O.R.T.C. Breast Cancer Cooperative Group.","Sixty-four patients with advanced progressive breast cancer resistant to conventional treatments were entered into the present study. They were randomized to receive either Carminomycin (CMM) 20 mg/m2 or Doxorubicin (DOX) 75 mg/m2, both drugs being administered by i.v. bolus every 3 weeks until progression of the disease. Five patients were not eligible and response could not be evaluated in another eight patients. Three patients had only one course due to disease-related early death. Among twenty-seven evaluable patients who received at least two courses of DOX one complete response and seven partial responses were observed for an overall response rate of 30%. CMM showed significantly lower (P = 0.04) antitumor activity with only one partial response (4%) among the 24 patients who received at least two courses of therapy. Median duration of response dating from the start of chemotherapy was 46 weeks on DOX (range 18-102+) and 30 weeks for the single partial response on CMM. Although the median time to progression for all patients receiving CMM (9 weeks) was significantly shorter (P = 0.04) than for those receiving DOX (30 weeks), patients on DOX had only a marginally longer duration of survival (P = .28) than those initially treated with CMM. Myelotoxicity was more severe in the CMM treated group than in the DOX group. Other toxicities such as alopecia, nausea and vomiting were slightly more severe in the DOX treated group. On the basis of this and other similar randomized studies, CMM cannot be recommended for further application in the treatment of advanced breast cancer.",1
Granisetron compared with prednisolone plus metopimazine as anti-emetic prophylaxis during multiple cycles of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy.,"This randomized, double-blind, double-dummy parallel study compared the anti-emetic efficacy and tolerability of the serotonin antagonist granisetron with prednisolone plus the dopamine D2 antagonist metopimazine during nine cycles of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. Chemotherapy naive women with stage I or II breast cancer scheduled to intravenous cyclophosphamide, fluorouracil and methotrexate or cyclophosphamide, epirubicin and fluorouracil every 3 weeks were included. Patients received a single intravenous dose of granisetron 3 mg or a 3-day oral treatment with prednisolone 25 mg once a day plus metopimazine 30 mg four times a day. A total of 223 women were enrolled and 218 patients (97.8%) were evaluable for efficacy. Granisetron (n = 109) was superior to prednisolone plus metopimazine (n = 109) in the prophylaxis of acute nausea and vomiting during the first cycle of chemotherapy (P < 0.001) and prednisolone plus metopimazine was superior on days 2-5 (P = 0.002). Overall, granisetron was superior on days 1-5 (P = 0.009). The median number of cycles completed with granisetron was five (95% confidence interval 4-6) compared with two (95% confidence interval 2-2) for prednisolone plus metopimazine (P = 0.0019). Constipation and rash were reported more frequently with granisetron (P < 0.001 and P = 0.043 respectively) and palpitations more frequently with prednisolone plus metopimazine (P = 0.015). In conclusion, the number of cycles completed with granisetron was significantly higher than the number completed with prednisolone plus metopimazine, but the anti-emetic efficacy of both treatments declined during multiple cycles of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy.",1
Thymidine labeling index analysis in early breast cancer patients randomized to receive perioperative chemotherapy.,"OBJECTIVE: To identify through a substudy of a larger, multicenter study of adjuvant treatment in primary operable breast cancer patients any possible correlation between cellular proliferation rate, measured by thymidine labeling index (TLI), and perioperative chemotherapy (periCT). METHODS: TLI was measured in slices of early breast carcinoma patients. The main trial was designed to randomize patients after primary surgery to receive one cycle of periCT consisting of cyclophosphamide, epidoxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil, or no periCT. RESULTS: Of 600 patients randomized into the main study, 197 were eligible for inclusion in this substudy. Characteristics of patients were quite similar to those of the entire population entered into the main study. The TLI cutoff value in our series was 0.7% expressed as the median percentage ratio of thymidine-labeled cells undergoing DNA synthesis in the tumor cell population of specimens from the 197 patients. No differences were observed in terms of relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) after grouping the patients by TLI value (low and high) and by treatment. Among node-negative patients, a significant improvement in terms of OS (p = 0.02), but not RFS (p = 0.06), was seen in patients with a high-TLI value who underwent periCT versus controls. CONCLUSIONS: TLI may be a useful tool for the identification of node-negative patients with high-TLI values who may benefit from periCT.",0
Beneficial effect of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy in primary breast cancer patients with high oestrogen receptor values.,"Oestrogen receptor concentrations were measured in primary tumours of 291 postmenopausal breast cancer patients with high risk of recurrence. These patients were a subset of the 1650 patients participating in the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group's trial of adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen (30 mg daily for one year). A cut-off point of 10 fmol/mg cytosol protein and the use of a Cox proportional hazards model distinguished between patients with long recurrence-free survivals and those with early recurrent disease. The use of this model also showed that patients with an oestrogen-receptor content below 100 fmol/mg did not benefit from the endocrine therapy, while those with concentrations above 100 fmol/mg had a significantly longer recurrence-free survival. This finding is consistent with the response of advanced breast cancer to endocrine treatment.",0
Comparison of subjective and objective hot flash measures over time among breast cancer survivors initiating aromatase inhibitor therapy.,"OBJECTIVE: Hot flashes are valuable indicators of physiological condition and drug effect; however, subjective and objective measures do not always agree. No study has examined both subjective and objective hot flashes in women prescribed aromatase inhibitors. The study (1) compared subjective and objective hot flash measures, (2) examined changes in subjective and objective hot flashes over time, and (3) evaluated predictors of change in hot flashes in aromatase inhibitor-treated women.METHODS: Participants (n = 135) were enrolled in a randomized clinical trial comparing exemestane and letrozole for the treatment of breast cancer. Hot flashes were assessed before the start of the drug therapy and 1, 3, and 6 months later. Participants wore a sternal skin conductance monitor for 24 hours or longer at each time point. With each perceived hot flash, women pressed an event button and rated intensity and bother in a paper diary.RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 60 years and were mainly white (92%). Across time points, monitor hot flashes were (1) significantly more frequent than diary and/or event button flashes (P < 0.05) and (2) moderately correlated with subjective measures (0.35 < r < 0.56). Monitor hot flashes did not significantly change over time with aromatase inhibitor therapy, whereas both diary and event button frequencies significantly varied but in dissimilar patterns (51% nonlinear). No consistent predictors of hot flashes across measures or time points were identified.CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicated dissimilarities between subjective and objective measures of hot flashes. Despite statistical significance, there was little clinically meaningful change in hot flashes after initiating aromatase inhibitor therapy.",0
Breast conserving therapy in stage I & II breast cancer in Korea.,"A randomized clinical study of 187 patients with T1, T2 breast cancer was performed, in order to compare the effects of modified radical mastectomy (MRM) and breast conserving therapy (BCT) on breast recurrence, overall survival, and disease-free survival. One hundred eighty seven patients with T1, T2 breast cancer, admitted at Yongdong Severance Hospital from April 1991 to August 1994, were randomized into two different treatment groups. Of the 187 patients, 111 patients had received MRM and 76 had received BCT. In any of the variables considered with the exceptions of age and menopausal status, patient characteristics such as tumor size, incidence of axillary lymph node metastasis, histologic grading, and estrogen and progesterone receptor positive rate were not significantly different between the two groups (p < 0.05). Using the Kaplan-Meier Product-limit method and log-rank test, the difference of locoregional recurrence, and overall and disease-free survival, between these comparable groups was analyzed. Average follow-up period was 37.6 months. Two out of 111 MRM patients and two out of 76 BCT patients had locoregional recurrence. Only one patient who had MRM was found to have a recurrence in her opposite breast. The overall survival rates in MRM and BCT patients were, respectively 93.7% and 94.1%. Furthermore, the disease-free survival rates were, respectively, 89.2% and 93.9%. This result indicates that there were no significant differences between two groups in locoregional recurrence, and overall and disease-free survival. Having gained a better cosmetic appearance, the conservative treatment group was satisfied with the BCT. In this study, we conclude that BCT is a good alternative surgical treatment modality for T1, T2 Korean breast cancer patients, which could substitute for the more traditional MRM. However, further follow-up will be needed for long-term results.",0
Randomized controlled trial comparing oral doxifluridine plus oral cyclophosphamide with doxifluridine alone in women with node-positive breast cancer after primary surgery.,"PURPOSE: We compared the therapeutic usefulness of doxifluridine (5'-DFUR) alone and a combination of 5'-DFUR plus cyclophosphamide (CPM), both of which are considered effective against advanced and recurrent breast cancer, to determine which treatment is more beneficial as postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 1,131 women with node-positive primary breast cancer were randomly assigned after primary surgery to receive 5'-DFUR alone or 5'-DFUR plus CPM. All patients initially received 5'-DFUR in an oral dose of 1,200 mg/d for 4 weeks, starting 4 weeks after surgery. Chemotherapy was then not given for 2 weeks. Patients in the 5'-DFUR group subsequently received five 4-week cycles of treatment consisting of oral 5'-DFUR (1,200 mg/d) for the first 2 weeks and no chemotherapy for the next 2 weeks. Those assigned to the 5'-DFUR plus CPM group also received oral CPM 100 mg/d for the first 2 weeks and no chemotherapy for the next 2 weeks. Women 50 years or older concurrently received 20 mg/d of tamoxifen for 2 years in both groups. RESULTS: Of the 1,088 eligible women, 546 were assigned to receive 5'-DFUR alone and 542 were assigned to receive 5'-DFUR plus CPM. Overall disease-free survival was significantly better in women who received 5'-DFUR plus CPM than in those who received 5'-DFUR alone (log-rank test, P =.021). Toxic effects occurred in 20.0% of patients (109 of 546) in the 5'-DFUR group and 32.3% of patients (175 of 542) in the 5'-DFUR plus CPM group (chi(2) test, P <.001). CONCLUSION: Combination therapy with 5'-DFUR plus CPM is more effective in preventing recurrence than 5'-DFUR alone.",1
"Prognostic value of extracapsular tumor spread for locoregional control in premenopausal patients with node-positive breast cancer treated with classical cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil: long-term observations from International Breast Cancer Study Group Trial VI.","PURPOSE: We sought to determine retrospectively whether extracapsular spread (ECS) might identify a subgroup that could benefit from radiotherapy after mastectomy, especially patients with 1 to 3 positive lymph nodes (LN1-3+). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We randomized 1,475 premenopausal women with node-positive breast cancer to three, six, or nine courses of ""classical"" CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil). After a review of all pathology forms, 933 patients (63%) had information on the presence or absence of ECS. ECS was present in 49.5%. The median follow-up was 10 years. RESULTS: In univariate analyses, ECS was associated with worse disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). In multivariate analyses adjusting for tumor size, vessel invasion, surgery type, and age group, ECS remained significant (DFS: hazard ratio, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.34 to 1.93; P < .0001; OS: 1.67; 95% CI, 1.34 to 2.08; P < .0001). However, ECS was not significant when the number of positive nodes was added. The locoregional failure rate +/- distant failure (LRF +/- distant failure) within 10 years was estimated at 19% (+/- 2%) without ECS, versus 27% (+/- 2%) with ECS. The difference was statistically significant in univariate analyses, but not after adjusting for the number of positive nodes. No independent effect of ECS on DFS, OS, or LRF could be confirmed within the subgroup of 382 patients with LN1-3+ treated with mastectomy without radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: Our results do not support an independent prognostic value of ECS, nor its use as an indication for irradiation in premenopausal patients with LN1-3+ treated with classical CMF. However, we could not examine whether extensive ECS is of prognostic importance.",0
Chemotherapy and survival in advanced breast cancer: the inclusion of doxorubicin in Cooper type regimens.,"The value of the inclusion of doxorubicin hydrochloride (dox) in Cooper type regimens in advanced breast cancer was assessed by performing an overview employing summary statistics derived from published papers of randomised clinical trials comparing Cooper type regimens that contain dox with regimens in which dox was replaced by one or more compounds. Trials were selected which published data on survival, time to treatment failure and response rate. This study suggests that dox confers advantages on all of these endpoints and that the size of such benefits needs to be taken into account when deciding whether to use dox.",0
Dibromodulcitol and adriamycin +/- tamoxifen in advanced breast cancer.,"The therapeutic effectiveness of combining tamoxifen with a combination chemotherapy regimen was tested in 135 patients with advanced breast cancer previously treated with chemotherapy. Patients were randomly allocated to received dibromodulcitol + Adriamycin (DA, 55 patients) or DA + tamoxifen (DAT, 67 patients). An additional 13 patients less than 50 years of age were assigned to DAT (DATN). Pretreatment characteristics were similar across both regimens. DAT and DATN yielded similar results in the less than 50-year-old cohort. DAT tended to be superior to DA with respect to response rate (55% versus 36%, p = 0.004), time to treatment failure (medians: 170 days versus 110 days, log rank p = 0.001), responders' time to treatment failure (360 days versus 220 days, p = 0.035), and survival (340 days versus 270 days, p = 0.18). Toxicity was similar in both regimens. Thus, addition of tamoxifen to a second-line DA regimen appears to increase the therapeutic effectiveness. It is suggested that the addition of this antiestrogen to other chemotherapy regimens would also be beneficial.",1
Ondansetron plus metopimazine compared with ondansetron plus metopimazine plus prednisolone as antiemetic prophylaxis in patients receiving multiple cycles of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy.,"PURPOSE: To compare the antiemetic efficacy and tolerability of ondansetron plus metopimazine with ondansetron plus metopimazine plus prednisolone during nine cycles of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 221 women with stage I or II breast cancer and no prior chemotherapy who were scheduled to receive adjuvant chemotherapy with intravenous cyclophosphamide, fluorouracil and methotrexate or cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and fluorouracil given every 3 weeks were included in a double-blind parallel trial. Patients were randomized to 3 days of oral treatment with ondansetron plus metopimazine, or ondansetron plus metopimazine plus prednisolone. Ondansetron was administered as 8 mg bid, metopimazine as 30 mg qid, and prednisolone as 50 mg qd. RESULTS: In all, 216 patients (97.7%) were assessable for efficacy during a total of 1,462 cycles. In cycle 1, complete protection from emetic episodes/nausea day 1, days 2 through 5, and days 1 through 5 was achieved in 84.4%/51.4%, 82.6%/41.3%, and 79.8%/34.9% with ondansetron plus metopimazine and in 84.1%/57.0%, 86.8%/53.8%, and 79.4%/43.0% with ondansetron plus metopimazine plus prednisolone, respectively. In cycle 1, the three-drug combination was superior only in the treatment of nausea on days 2 through 5 (P =.0497). The cumulative emetic protection rate after nine cycles was 0.52 with ondansetron plus metopimazine and 0.75 with ondansetron plus metopimazine plus prednisolone. Side effects were generally few and mild with both treatments. Constipation was the only adverse event significantly more frequent with the three-drug combination (P =.029). CONCLUSION: Ondansetron plus metopimazine plus prednisolone is highly effective and superior to ondansetron plus metopimazine during nine cycles of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy.",0
"Comparison of mammography, sonography, MRI and clinical examination in patients with locally advanced or inflammatory breast cancer who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy.","OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the relative accuracies of mammography, sonography, MRI and clinical examination in predicting residual tumour size and pathological response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced or inflammatory breast cancer. Each prediction method was compared with the gold standard of surgical pathology. METHODS: 43 patients (age range, 25-62 years; mean age, 42.7 years) with locally advanced or inflammatory breast cancer who had been treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy were enrolled prospectively. We compared the predicted residual tumour size and the predicted response on imaging and clinical examination with residual tumour size and response on pathology. Statistical analysis was performed using weighted kappa statistics and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). RESULTS: The ICC values between predicted tumour size and pathologically determined tumour size were 0.65 for clinical examination, 0.69 for mammography, 0.78 for sonography and 0.97 for MRI. Agreement between the response predictions at mid-treatment and the responses measured by pathology had kappa values of 0.28 for clinical examination, 0.32 for mammography, 0.46 for sonography and 0.68 for MRI. Agreement between the final response predictions and the responses measured by pathology had kappa values of 0.43 for clinical examination, 0.44 for mammography, 0.50 for sonography and 0.82 for MRI. CONCLUSION: Predictions of response and residual tumour size made on MRI were better correlated with the assessments of response and residual tumour size made upon pathology than were predictions made on the basis of clinical examination, mammography or sonography. Thus, the evaluation of predicted response using MRI could provide a relatively sensitive early assessment of chemotherapy efficacy.",0
Mitoxantrone versus doxorubicin in combination chemotherapy for advanced carcinoma of the breast.,"One hundred fifteen patients with metastatic carcinoma of the breast were treated in a randomized trial of mitoxantrone (Novantrone, Lederle Laboratories, Pearl River, NY) combined with vincristine and prednisolone (VMP) or doxorubicin (Adriamycin, Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) combined with vincristine and prednisolone (VAP). In 100 evaluable patients, the objective response rates were 35% for VMP and 61% for VAP, the complete response rates being 6% and 13%, respectively. In responding patients, median time to progression was 6.2 months for VMP and 7.9 months for VAP. The median survival whether measured from primary diagnosis, first metastasis, or from the start of chemotherapy was similar for both regimens. Toxicity, particularly alopecia, was appreciably lower in the VMP treated patients, but subclinical cardiotoxicity was seen within the scheduled dosage for both combinations. We conclude that VAP is clearly more active, but clinically more toxic than VMP. There is no survival advantage conferred by the more toxic combination. Cardiac toxicity is a potential hazard with either drug combination.",1
"Randomised trial of chemo-endocrine therapy, endocrine therapy, and mastectomy alone in postmenopausal patients with operable breast cancer and axillary node metastasis.","Adjuvant therapy after total mastectomy and axillary clearance in postmenopausal women with breast cancer and axillary node metastasis was assessed; chemo-endocrine therapy (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil, prednisone, and tamoxifen; CMFp + T) was compared with endocrine therapy (prednisone and tamoxifen; p + T), and with no adjuvant treatment in 463 patients aged less than or equal to 65 years. Endocrine therapy was compared with no adjuvant therapy in 320 patients aged 66-80 years. At median follow-up of 36 months, disease-free survival was significantly longer in CMFp + T patients than in p + T or control patients; p + T also significantly increased disease-free survival. There were no significant differences in overall survival between the randomised groups. In analyses of patterns of first failure, chemo-endocrine therapy reduced local, regional, and distant relapses, whereas endocrine therapy reduced local and regional recurrences only.",1
Long-term follow-up of the randomized Stockholm trial on adjuvant tamoxifen among postmenopausal patients with early stage breast cancer.,"The Stockholm Breast Cancer Study Group conducted a randomized trial during 1976 through 1990 comparing adjuvant tamoxifen versus control. A total of 2,738 postmenopausal women with invasive, early stage disease were randomised between tamoxifen for 2 or 5 years, or no adjuvant endocrine therapy. Among high-risk patients the treatment was given against a background of either postoperative, locoregional radiation or CMF-type chemotherapy. The median follow up was 18 years (range 11-25 years). There was a statistically significant (p =0.001) interaction between ER status and tamoxifen with no treatment benefit among receptor negatives. PgR-status had little additional predictive value. Among ER-positive patients tamoxifen reduced locoregional recurrences by 48%, contralateral breast cancers by 54%, distant metastases by 28%, and all events by 24% (p <0.001). On the other hand, there was a substantial increase of endometrial cancer associated with tamoxifen. There was no effect of tamoxifen on intercurrent mortality whereas breast cancer deaths were reduced by 31% (p <0.001) and overall mortality by 15% (p =0.01). Tamoxifen produced long-term benefits among estrogen receptor positive patients in terms of breast cancer-related events, but also an increased incidence of endometrial cancer. Despite long-term follow-up we observed no benefit with tamoxifen in terms of cardiovascular mortality.",1
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for detection of HER-2/neu amplification in breast cancer: a multicenter portability study.,"Amplification and/or overexpression of HER-2/neu has been shown to be both a prognostic and predictive marker in breast cancer. Recent studies have also confirmed the efficacy of Herceptin (trastuzumab) as adjuvant therapy for patients with overexpression of HER-2/neu. Therefore, it is critical that precise and reproducible assays be used in the clinical laboratory setting for determination of the HER-2/neu status in patients with breast cancer. The objective of this study was to determine the portability (reproducibility between different institutions) of the PathVysion HER-2 fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay used for detection of amplification of the HER-2/neu gene in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. Study specimens consisted of one breast tumor with a normal HER-2/neu copy number, two tumors with a low level, and one tumor with a high level of HER-2/neu amplification. The PathVysion HER-2 assay was shown to be highly reproducible on different assay days (n = 3) and between different institutions (n = 5) in the detection of amplification of the HER-2/neu gene in routinely processed clinical specimens of breast carcinoma. In addition, this study examined the feasibility of enumerating FISH signals in 20 nuclei in contrast to 60 nuclei per specimen. Although a modest increase in variation was observed when analyzing 20 compared to 60 nuclei, the mean ratios were similar. Therefore, analysis of as few as 20 nuclei with this FISH HER-2/neu assay may be sufficient for determining the amplification level of the HER-2/neu gene.",0
Palliative effect of chemotherapy: objective tumor response is associated with symptom improvement in patients with metastatic breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: Because one of the goals of chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer is to provide symptom palliation, we were interested in identifying the relationship between tumor shrinkage and improvement in disease-related symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred patients enrolled onto a randomized trial of metastatic breast cancer formed the basis of our study. The nine most common baseline symptoms were identified and followed. Changes from baseline (improvement, stable, worsening) were defined using patient responses to a quality-of-life (QoL) questionnaire (the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer EORTC QLQ-C30) as well as using graded toxicity data collected on case report forms (CRFs). The association between symptom improvement and tumor response was assessed using a linear trend test via a logistic regression model. RESULTS: The most commonly reported baseline symptoms were cancer pain in 38% (CRF data) and 81% of patients (QoL data) and tiredness in 26% (CRF data) and 89% (QoL data) of patients. Three symptoms-cancer pain, shortness of breath, and abnormal mood-showed a significant relationship between improvement and objective response, using both CRF and QoL assessments. Constipation, anorexia, and nausea showed a similar trend when QoL data were used but not when CRF information was used. The converse was seen for lethargy. There was no correlation between symptom change and response for cough and insomnia. CONCLUSION: For some symptoms, we found a significant association between symptom improvement and objective tumor regression. In these cases, symptom improvement was greatest in those patients who had complete or partial responses, followed by those with stable disease and then those with progressive disease. Further work in this area will be useful in determining the surrogate value of objective tumor response in identifying the efficacy of palliative chemotherapy.",0
Letrozole inhibits tumor proliferation more effectively than tamoxifen independent of HER1/2 expression status.,"BACKGROUND: The biological basis for the superior efficacy of neoadjuvant letrozole versus tamoxifen for postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive locally advanced breast cancer was investigated by analyzing tumor proliferation and expression of estrogen-regulated genes before and after the initiation of therapy. METHODS: Tumor samples were obtained at baseline and at the end of treatment from 185 patients participating in a double blind randomized Phase III study of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy. These paired specimens were simultaneously analyzed for Ki67, ER, progesterone receptor (PgR), trefoil factor 1 (PS2), HER1 (epidermal growth factor receptor), and HER2 (ErbB2 or neu) by semiquantitative immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The treatment-induced reduction in geometric mean Ki67 was significantly greater with letrozole (87%) than tamoxifen (75%; analysis of covariance P = 0.0009). Differences in the average Ki67 reduction were particularly marked for ER-positive tumors that overexpressed HER1 and/or HER2 (88 versus 45%, respectively; P = 0.0018). Twenty-three of 92 tumors (25%) on tamoxifen and 14 of 93 on letrozole (15%) showed a paradoxical increase in Ki67 with treatment, and the majority of these cases was HER1/2 negative. Letrozole, but not tamoxifen, significantly reduced expression of the estrogen-regulated proteins PgR and trefoil factor 1, regardless of HER1/2 status (P < 0.0001). ER down-regulation occurred with both agents, although levels decreased more with tamoxifen (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Letrozole inhibited tumor proliferation to a greater extent than tamoxifen. The molecular basis for this advantage appears complex but includes possible tamoxifen agonist effects on the cell cycle in both HER1/2+ and HER1/2- tumors. A pattern of continued proliferation despite appropriate down-regulation of PgR expression with estrogen deprivation or tamoxifen was also documented. This observation suggests the estrogenic regulation of proliferation and PgR expression may be dissociated in endocrine therapy resistant cells.",0
Second malignancies after CMF for resectable breast cancer.,"From June 1973 to May 1978, a total of 845 women with resectable breast cancer and positive axillary nodes were entered into two consecutive randomized studies evaluating adjuvant chemotherapy. All patients were subjected to radical or modified radical mastectomy, none received postoperative radiation, and 666 were administered adjuvant CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil). After a median follow-up in excess of 10 years, no cases of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia were detected, but 21 second solid tumors other than contralateral breast carcinoma were documented. The cumulative frequency was 4% +/- 1.9% after surgery alone, and 4.2% +/- 1.03% following adjuvant CMF. No differences were observed between patients aged up to 50 years (surgery, 3.1% +/- 2.2%; CMF, 3.3% +/- 1.3%) or older than 50 years (surgery, 4.5% +/- 2.6%; CMF, 5.2% +/- 1.8%). During the same period, a total of 29 contralateral breast carcinomas were documented for a cumulative frequency of 3.7% +/- 1.7% after surgery alone and of 5.2% +/- 1.4% following adjuvant CMF, respectively. We conclude that, at present, there is no evidence for an increased risk of second malignancies following adjuvant CMF as given in this series. Our findings would suggest that second tumors documented so far cannot be entirely ascribed to treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy, but they could be due to a chance association.",0
Tamoxifen use in breast cancer patients who subsequently develop corpus cancer is not associated with a higher incidence of adverse histologic features.,"Several reports have noted an association between the use of tamoxifen in breast cancer patients and the subsequent development of endometrial carcinoma. Magriples et al. (J. Clin. Oncol. 11, 485-490, 1993) recently reported that 67% of uterine cancers that developed in 15 breast cancer patients on tamoxifen had high-grade lesions or high-risk histologies, compared to 24% of those developing in 38 breast cancer patients not receiving tamoxifen. To confirm these results, we conducted a retrospective review of 73 patients with a history of breast cancer who subsequently developed uterine cancer and underwent surgery at our institution. Twenty-three (32%) had received tamoxifen for at least 1 year, with a median duration of use of 4.5 years, while 50 (68%) did not receive tamoxifen. The median interval between diagnosis of breast and corpus cancer was less in the group that received tamoxifen than in the group that did not (4.6 vs 6.7 years), but this was not statistically significant. Seventy-four percent of the corpus cancers in the tamoxifen group were adenocarcinomas, while 26% were considered high-risk histologies, which was identical to the findings for the group that did not receive tamoxifen. The distribution by FIGO stage was I, 15 (65%); II, 2 (9%); III, 5 (22%); and IV, 1 (4%) for the tamoxifen group, and I, 37 (74%); II, 1 (2%); III, 8 (16%); IV, 3 (6%); and unstaged, 1 (2%) for the group not receiving tamoxifen (P = NS). For patients with endometrial adenocarcinoma, 23% of the tamoxifen group had grade 3 lesions, compared with 19% of the no tamoxifen group (P = NS). Our review of corpus cancers developing in breast cancer patients demonstrated no significant difference in stage, grade, or histologic subtype based on tamoxifen use.",0
Serum EGFR and serum HER-2/neu are useful predictive and prognostic markers in metastatic breast cancer patients treated with metronomic chemotherapy.,"BACKGROUND: Metronomic chemotherapy has been demonstrated to be of value in patients with advanced breast cancer. No reliable markers of response are available. In breast tumor, HER-2/neu is a prognostic factor, whereas no definite data exist for EGFR. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prognostic and predictive role of serum HER-2/neu and serum EGFR in breast cancer patients treated with low-dose chemotherapy. METHODS: Serum levels of HER-2/neu (n = 135) and of EGFR (n = 113) were prospectively determined before the start of chemotherapy, after 2 months of treatment, and when progressive disease was diagnosed. RESULTS: Elevated (>15 ng/mL) serum HER-2/neu before the start of chemotherapy was not associated with response rate, whereas elevated serum HER-2/neu at 2 months was significantly associated with reduced long-term clinical benefit (24 weeks) (P < .001), as well as changes in HER-2/neu levels between baseline and 2 months (P < .0001). Multivariate analysis identified a >or=20% increase of serum HER-2/neu as an independent factor for progression-free survival (PFS). Kinetics of serum HER-2/neu were significantly associated with PFS (P < .0001) and overall survival (OS) (P = .015). Low baseline serum levels of EGFR (<45 ng/mL) were predictive of reduced response rate both at 2 months (P = .031) and after 24 weeks (P = .022). Moreover, they were significantly associated with reduced PFS (P = .016) and OS (P = .015). CONCLUSIONS: Serum HER-2/neu and EGFR may represent useful markers for early prediction of probability of response, PFS, and OS in patients with advanced breast cancer treated with metronomic chemotherapy.",0
Her-2/neu overexpression and response to oophorectomy plus tamoxifen adjuvant therapy in estrogen receptor-positive premenopausal women with operable breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: Studies evaluating the relationship of HER-2/neu breast tumor status and response to adjuvant endocrine therapy have reached conflicting conclusions about resistance of HER-2/neu-positive tumors to this treatment. We studied 282 patients participating in a randomized controlled trial of adjuvant oophorectomy and tamoxifen or observation who had estrogen receptor-positive tumors and whose tumors were evaluated for HER-2/neu overexpression by immunohistochemistry. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models and Kaplan-Meier disease-free and overall survival estimate methods were used. RESULTS: HER-2/neu overexpression was a negative prognostic factor for overall survival. In univariate analyses, in HER-2/neu-positive patients, the hazard ratio (HR) for disease-free survival (DFS) with adjuvant endocrine therapy was 0.37 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.26 to 0.89); for HER-2/neu-negative patients, the corresponding HR for DFS was 0.48 (95% CI, 0.31 to 0.71). The overall survival (OS) data were HR=0.26 (95% CI, 0.07 to 0.92) and HR=0.68 (95% CI, 0.32 to 1.42) for HER-2/neu-positive and HER-2/neu-negative patients, respectively. In multivariate models, the P values for tests of interaction of HER-2/neu status and response to adjuvant endocrine therapy were 0.18 and 0.07 for DFS and OS, respectively. Kaplan-Meier DFS and OS curves and 3-year DFS estimates were consistent in showing greater benefit to the HER-2/neu-positive subgroup given adjuvant treatment. CONCLUSION: HER-2/neu overexpression does not adversely and may favorably influence response to adjuvant oophorectomy and tamoxifen treatment in patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors.",1
Randomised trial of chemotherapy versus endocrine therapy in patients presenting with locally advanced breast cancer (a pilot study).,"Sixty patients with locally advanced breast cancer, but with no evidence of distant metastases were randomised to receive primary endocrine therapy or chemotherapy after assessment and 'Trucut' biopsy of the primary tumour. After 12 weeks all patients were assessed. Eight out of 30 (27%) of the patients who received chemotherapy showed complete clinical regression of the primary cancer, eight patients' tumours had regressed by more than 50%, and ten showed a 25-50% reduction in bi-dimensional diameter. Only four (13%) patients' tumours failed to reduce in size. Seven patients were judged to require mastectomy at the end of the 12 week period of treatment with chemotherapy. In contrast, only three out of 30 (10%) patients receiving endocrine therapy showed a greater than 50% reduction in tumour size, and four patients had a 25-50% reduction at 12 weeks. The remaining patients' tumours either stabilised (12 patients) or enlarged (11 patients). We conclude that primary chemotherapy in patients with primary breast cancer is more effective in rapidly reducing the size of the primary breast cancer than endocrine therapy (P = 0.001) and alters significantly the future management of these patients. However, at 65 weeks on completion of the follow-up, there is no significant difference in the number of patients' disease-free, locally or distant recurrent, or dead.",1
"Tumor markers cancer antigen 15.3, carcinoembryonic antigen, and tissue polypeptide antigen for monitoring metastatic breast cancer during first-line chemotherapy and follow-up.","We investigated whether model systems integrating stochastic variation into criteria for marker assessment could be used for monitoring metastatic breast cancer. A total of 3989 serum samples was obtained from 204 patients receiving first-line chemotherapy and from 112 of these patients during follow-up. Each sample was analyzed for cancer antigen 15.3, carcinoembryonic antigen, and tissue polypeptide antigen. The efficiency for identifying progression and nonprogression was 94% during therapy and 85% during follow-up, with no false-positive marker results for progressive disease. At clinical progressive disease, the median positive lead time was 35 days during therapy and 76 days during follow-up. Tumor marker assessment may document that a therapy is effective and ought to be continued in spite of adverse toxic effects, and that a treatment is ineffective and should be stopped to prevent unnecessary toxicity. Marker information may also be useful in studies investigating whether early treatment during follow-up will alter the prognosis of metastatic breast cancer.",0

Tetracosactrin vs. methylprednisolone in the prevention of emesis in patients receiving FEC regimen for breast cancer.,"0.5 mg tetracosactrin is considered to be equivalent to 40 mg methylprednisolone with regard to the induced cortisol secretion. 97 female breast cancer patients who received their first two FEC courses (epirubicin 50-75 mg/m2, 5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2) entered this randomised crossover study (76 had previously received an adjuvant treatment); tetracosactrin was administered intramuscularly and methylprednisolone intravenously immediately before chemotherapy administration. The tolerability was evaluated using a diary card during 5 days and patients were asked for their preference at the end of the two cycles. There was no difference either for vomiting (dry heaves were included) or nausea between the two treatments (the analysis was performed on day 1, the worse day of days 2 and 3 and the worse day of days 4 and 5). At day 1, 49% of the patients experienced no or mild nausea after tetracosactrin and 62% after methylprednisolone (not significant) (first period analysis); a complete control of vomiting (including dry heaves) was observed in 49% of the patients after tetracosactrin and 53% after methylprednisolone (not significant). No difference was observed between patients with or without previous chemotherapy. However, slightly more patients preferred tetracosactrin (P = 0.048).",0
Evaluation of high-dose versus standard FAC chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer in protected environment units: a prospective randomized study.,"Fifty-nine evaluable patients under 65 years of age with measurable metastatic breast cancer and without prior chemotherapy were randomly assigned to treatment with fluorouracil, Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), and cyclophosphamide (FAC) at standard or high doses (100% to 260% higher than standard FAC) following a dose escalation schedule. Patients randomized to the high-dose FAC received the first three cycles of therapy within a protected environment. Subsequent cycles for this group were administered at standard doses of FAC in an ambulatory setting, the same as for the control group. After reaching 450 mg/m2 of Adriamycin, patients in both groups continued treatment with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil until there was disease progression. Analysis of pretreatment patient characteristics showed an even distribution for most known pretreatment factors, although the control group had slightly (but nonsignificantly) more favorable prognostic characteristics. Fourteen patients (24%) achieved a complete remission (CR) and 32 (54%) achieved a partial remission (PR), for an overall major response rate of 78%. There were no differences in overall, CR, or PR rates between the high-dose FAC and control groups. The median response durations were 11 and 10 months for the protected environment and control groups, respectively, and the median survival was 20 months for both groups. Hematologic, gastrointestinal (GI), and infection-related complications were significantly more frequent and severe in the group treated with high-dose chemotherapy. Stomatitis, diarrhea, and skin toxicity were dose-limiting. However, there were no treatment-related deaths. High-dose induction combination chemotherapy with the agents used in this study failed to increase the response rate or survival duration, and resulted in a substantial increase in toxicity.",1
Gefitinib or placebo in combination with tamoxifen in patients with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer: a randomized phase II study.,"PURPOSE: Increased growth factor signaling may contribute to tamoxifen resistance. This randomized phase II trial assessed tamoxifen plus placebo or the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor gefitinib in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive metastatic breast cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with newly metastatic disease or recurred after adjuvant tamoxifen (stratum 1), or recurred during/after adjuvant aromatase inhibitor (AI) or after failed first-line AI (stratum 2), were eligible. Primary variables were progression-free survival (PFS; stratum 1) and clinical benefit rate (CBR; stratum 2). A 5% or more improvement in response variables with gefitinib was considered to warrant further investigation. Outcome was correlated with biomarkers measured on the primary tumor. RESULTS: In stratum 1 (n = 206), the PFS HR (gefitinib:placebo) was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.59-1.18; median PFS 10.9 versus 8.8 months). In the stratum 1 endocrine therapy-naïve subset (n = 158) the HR was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.52-1.15), and the prior endocrine-treated subgroup (n = 48) 1.47 (95% CI, 0.63-3.45). In stratum 1, CBRs were 50.5% with gefitinib and 45.5% with placebo. In stratum 2 (n = 84), CBRs were 29.2% with gefitinib and 31.4% with placebo. Biomarker analysis suggested that in stratum 1 there was greater benefit with gefitinib in patients who were ER-negative or had lower levels of ER protein. CONCLUSIONS: In stratum 1, the improved PFS with gefitinib plus tamoxifen met the protocol criteria to warrant further investigation of this strategy. In stratum 2, there was a numerical disadvantage for gefitinib; additional investigation after AI therapy is not warranted. Studies of predictive biomarkers are needed to subset appropriate patients.",1
Scalp cooling has no place in the prevention of alopecia in adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.,"35 patients were studied to determine the effectiveness of scalp hypothermia in the prevention of alopecia caused by adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. Scalp hypothermia was induced by the newly developed Theracool cooling machine. The chemotherapeutic regimen consisted of one perioperative course of doxorubicin 50 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 and 5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m2 (EORTC protocol 10854). Only 4 (11%) patients showed acceptable hair preservation (no or minor alopecia). 12 patients (34%) had moderate alopecia, all requiring a wig. 19 patients (54%) had complete alopecia. No scalp metastases were observed after scalp cooling. These results and a review of the literature suggest that scalp hypothermia to prevent alopecia may only be effective in a cytotoxic regimen containing an anthracycline as the sole alopecia-inducing agent. With current adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer, in which a combination of cyclophosphamide and an anthracycline is often used, there is no place for scalp hypothermia.",0
Side effects of adjuvant endocrine treatment in premenopausal breast cancer patients: a prospective randomized study.,"PURPOSE: To compare the effect of adjuvant endocrine therapies with and without chemotherapy on physical symptoms, anxiety, and depressive symptoms in premenopausal women with breast cancer in a randomized clinical trial (the Zoladex in Premenopausal Patients trial). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The patients were randomly assigned to goserelin, goserelin plus tamoxifen, tamoxifen alone, or no endocrine therapy. The duration of the endocrine treatment was 2 years. The groups were observed for 3 years after primary treatment (ie, during 2 years of active treatment as well as 1 year after cessation of the adjuvant endocrine therapy). All patients with node-positive disease received adjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF), which was given concurrently with the endocrine treatment. RESULTS: Patients treated with CMF typically reported higher levels of physical symptoms than did patients who did not receive CMF. It was only among patients who did not receive chemotherapy that the endocrine treatment had differential effects. Goserelin was most burdensome and resulted in similar symptom levels as those of CMF, whereas the side effects of tamoxifen alone were milder. After cessation of the endocrine treatment, the side effects diminished in patients who had not received CMF, whereas patients treated with CMF reported ongoing problems at the 3-year follow-up. In contrast, anxiety and depressive symptoms were not significantly affected by endocrine treatment or chemotherapy during the 3 years of assessment. CONCLUSION: Goserelin and tamoxifen resulted in menopausal symptoms, but these symptoms were reversible. However, women treated with CMF experienced physical symptoms throughout the whole study period.",0
"Randomized phase III trial of adjuvant epirubicin followed by cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) versus CMF followed by epirubicin in patients with node-negative or 1-3 node-positive rapidly proliferating breast cancer.","Adjuvant cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) have proven highly effective in rapidly proliferating breast cancer (RPBC). It has also been seen that sequential administration of doxorubicin and CMF is superior to their alternation, especially in indolent tumors. In a phase III study, we evaluated whether adjuvant epirubicin (E) followed by CMF is superior to the inverse sequence in RPBC. Patients with node-negative or 1-3 node-positive RPBC (Thymidine Labeling Index > 3% or histological grade 3 or S-phase > 10% or Ki67 > 20%) were randomized to receive E (100 mg/m(2) i.v. d1, q21 days for 4 cycles) followed by CMF (600, 40, 600 mg/m(2) i.v. d1 and 8, q28 days for 4 cycles) (E → CMF) or CMF followed by E (CMF → E) or CMF for 6 cycles. From November 1997 to December 2004, 1066 patients were enrolled: E → CMF 440, CMF → E 438, and CMF 188. At a median follow-up of 69 months, 5-year OS was 91% (95% CI 88-94) for E → CMF and 93% (95% CI 90-95) for CMF → E, with adjusted hazard ratio of 0.88 (95% CI 0.58-1.35), and DFS was 80% in both arms, with adjusted hazard ratio of 0.99 (95% CI 0.73-1.33, Cox model). Adverse events were similar, apart from a higher rate of neutropenia in the CMF → E arm. No important differences in clinical outcome were observed between the two different sequences, making both a valid option in early breast cancer. Further molecular characterization of the tumors might help to identify subgroups achieving higher benefit from either sequence.",1
"The ATAC (Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination) adjuvant breast cancer trial in postmenopausal patients: factors influencing the success of patient recruitment.","The ATAC ('Arimidex', Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination) trial is a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy trial, evaluating anastrozole alone or in combination with tamoxifen compared with tamoxifen alone, as a 5-year adjuvant treatment for postmenopausal patients with early breast cancer. The rapid rate of recruitment into this trial was a major achievement, as frequently encountered differences between projected and actual recruitment rates can threaten the successful completion of clinical trials. A questionnaire designed in order to highlight possible factors influencing the success of patient recruitment was completed by 62% of the ATAC trialists. This included 11 statements rated for their level of importance on a three-point scale. The top three motives for recruiting patients were: (1) the attractive scientific rationale of the trial (84%); (2) a design that was easy to explain to patients (79%); and (3) a pragmatic trial design in line with standard practice (76%). A new questionnaire will solicit opinion from the participating patients.",0
Adjuvant CMFVP versus melphalan for operable breast cancer with positive axillary nodes: 10-year results of a Southwest Oncology Group Study.,"Four hundred forty-one women with operable breast cancer with histologically positive axillary nodes were randomized to receive either combination cyclophosphamide (60 mg/m2 orally everyday for 1 year); fluorouracil (300 mg/m2 intravenously [IV] weekly for 1 year); methotrexate (15 mg/m2 IV weekly for 1 year); vincristine (0.625 mg/m2 IV for 10 weeks); prednisone (30 mg/m2 orally days 1 to 14, 20 mg/m2 days 15 to 28, 10 mg/m2 days 29 to 42) (CMFVP) or single-agent melphalan (L-PAM) (5 mg/m2 orally every day for 5 days every 6 weeks for 2 years) chemotherapy after a modified or radical mastectomy between January 1975 and February 1978. Patients were stratified according to menopausal status and number of positive nodes (one to three, more than three nodes) before randomization. Seventy-eight patients were ineligible, most (56) because they were registered more than 42 days from surgery. Maximum duration of follow-up is 12 years, with a median of 9.8 years. The treatment arms were balanced with respect to age, menopausal status, and number of positive nodes. Among eligible patients, disease-free survival and survival were superior with CMFVP (P = .002, .005, respectively). At 10 years, 48% of patients treated with CMFVP remain alive and disease-free and 56% remain alive, compared with 35% alive and disease-free and 43% alive on the L-PAM arm. Disease-free survival and survival were significantly better with CMFVP compared with L-PAM only in premenopausal patients and patients with four or more positive nodes. Both regimens were well tolerated, although toxicity was more severe and more frequent with CMFVP. We conclude that after 10 years of follow-up, adjuvant combination chemotherapy with CMFVP is superior to single-agent L-PAM in patients with axillary node-positive primary breast cancer. The major advantage is in premenopausal women and in patients with more than three positive axillary nodes.",1
"Influence of letrozole and anastrozole on total body aromatization and plasma estrogen levels in postmenopausal breast cancer patients evaluated in a randomized, cross-over study.","PURPOSE: To compare the effects of the two novel, potent, nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors anastrozole and letrozole on total-body aromatization and plasma estrogen levels. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twelve postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive, metastatic breast cancer were treated with anastrozole 1 mg orally (PO) and letrozole 2.5 mg PO once daily, each given for a time interval of 6 weeks in a randomized sequence. Total-body aromatization was determined before treatment and at the end of each treatment period using a dual-label isotopic technique involving isolation of the metabolites with high-performance liquid chromatography. Plasma levels of estrone (E(1)), estradiol (E(2)), and estrone sulfate (E(1)S) were determined in samples obtained before each injection using highly sensitive radioimmunoassays. RESULTS: Pretreatment aromatase levels ranged from 1.68% to 4.27%. On-treatment levels of aromatase were detectable in 11 of 12 patients during treatment with anastrozole (mean percentage inhibition in the whole group, 97.3%) but in none of the 12 patients during treatment with letrozole (> 99.1% suppression in all patients; Wilcoxon, P =.0022, comparing the two drug regimens). Treatment with anastrozole suppressed plasma levels of E(1), E(2), and E(1)S by a mean of 81.0%, 84.9%, and 93.5%, respectively, whereas treatment with letrozole caused a corresponding decrease of 84.3%, 87.8% and 98.0%, respectively. The suppression of E(1) and E(1)S was found to be significantly better during treatment with letrozole compared with anastrozole (P =.019 and.0037, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study revealed letrozole (2.5 mg once daily) to be a more potent suppressor of total-body aromatization and plasma estrogen levels compared with anastrozole (1 mg once daily) in postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer.",0
Prognostic relevance of cerbB2 expression following neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients in a randomised trial of neoadjuvant versus adjuvant chemoendocrine therapy.,"Recent advances in the detection and treatment of breast cancer have led to an intensive search for new markers of both prognosis and chemoresponsiveness. The oncogene cerbB2 has proved to be one of the most promising markers currently under study, both as a predictor of chemoresponsiveness and as a marker of poor prognosis. In addition the increasing use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy has led to the loss of standard prognostic criteria. In order to study the potential role of cerbB2 expression as an indicator of chemoendocrine resistance and poor prognosis, both before and after chemotherapy, we obtained tumour sections from 283 women enrolled onto a neoadjuvant trial. In this trial patients were randomised to receive either primary surgery followed by adjuvant chemoendocrine treatment or neoadjuvant chemoendocrine therapy followed by surgery. CerbB2 status was determined immunohistochemically on all of these patients. Thirty-eight percent of the tumours were cerbB2 positive. There was no significant difference in expression between the adjuvant (41%) and neoadjuvant arms (35%). CerbB2 positive patients were much more likely to have shown non-response to chemoendocrine therapy (p < 0.001) and had a worse DES (p < 0.05). The best prognosis was seen in cerbB2 negative patients receiving neoadjuvant chemoendocrine therapy who showed a significantly better DFS (p < 0.05), than the cerbB2 negative patients receiving adjuvant therapy.",0
Adrenal steroids as parameters of the bioavailability of MA and MPA.,"Serum levels of cortisol (C), androstenedione (A), dehydroepiandrosterone (D), estrone (E1) and estradiol (E2) were chosen as parameters to compare the bioavailability of megestrol acetate (MA) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) in postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer. In 36 patients randomized to MPA, the levels of A (13% vs. 19%) and C (6% vs. 8%) were slightly lower than in 36 patients on MA, but D-levels (68% vs. 59%) and E1 or E2, were similar. The correlation between baseline C and A disappeared during treatment. Treatment levels of E1 and E2 were correlated. There was no correlation between individual drug levels and any steroid, indicating a maximal suppression. After ingestion of a single dose of MA or MPA, peak levels were found after 2-3 h for MA and 3-4 h for MPA. Four hours after ingestion, the levels of A and C were similar, 40-60% of baseline values, while D levels remained unaltered. Doubling the dose of either drug did not enhance hormone suppression, indicating that the drug dosage is maximally suppressive. In conclusion, although the median serum MA levels are double those of MPA, suppression of A, C and D is usually similar, with corresponding estrogen levels, demonstrating a comparable and maximal bioavailability. Higher dosages of MA or MPA will not increase their pharmacological effects any further.",0
Amplification of CCND1 and PAK1 as predictors of recurrence and tamoxifen resistance in postmenopausal breast cancer.,"The 11q13 region is amplified in approximately 15% of all breast tumors. Situated in this region are the cyclin D1 gene (CCND1) and the p-21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) gene. Both genes encode proteins shown to activate the estrogen receptor (ER), leading to transcription of CCND1 and other ER-responsive genes. Here, we investigate the prognostic and treatment predictive role of CCND1 and PAK1 gene amplification in postmenopausal breast cancer patients randomized to tamoxifen treatment or no adjuvant treatment. Amplification of CCND1 and PAK1, assessed by real-time PCR, was observed in 12.5 and 9.3%, respectively. Amplification of PAK1 was seen in 37% of the CCND1-amplified tumors, indicating coamplification (P<0.001). In ER-positive patients, amplification of at least one of the genes indicated a reduced recurrence-free survival (P=0.025). When response to tamoxifen treatment was analysed, patients with PAK1 amplification showed decreased benefit from the drug (ER+; relative risk ratio (RR)=1.62; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.47-5.55) compared to patients without amplification (ER+; RR=0.53; 95% CI, 0.32-0.88). This was not evident for CCND1 amplification. We show that PAK1 may be a predictor of tamoxifen resistance and furthermore, we do not discard PAK1 as a potential candidate oncogene in the 11q13 amplicon. In addition, we show that high pak1 protein levels may predict tamoxifen insensitivity.",0
Randomised and non-randomised prospective controlled cohort studies in matched-pair design for the long-term therapy of breast cancer patients with a mistletoe preparation (Iscador): a re-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: Expanded presentation and re-analysis of previously published data of randomized and non-randomized studies on mistletoe therapy with breast cancer patients [3, 4]. The main question is: Does a re-analysis confirm the previously reported effects of prolonging the survival of patients with breast cancer under long-term application of a complementary/anthroposophic therapy with the European mistletoe preparation Iscador? DATA SOURCES: (1) Randomised matched-pairs study: Breast cancer patients with only lymphatic metastases (17 pairs) that had never used mistletoe therapy were matched for several prognostic factors. By paired random allocation, one patient of a pair received a suggestion of mistletoe therapy to be applied by the attending physician. (2) Non-randomised matched-pairs studies: Patients that had already received mistletoe (Iscador) therapy were matched to control patients from the same pool using the same prognostic criteria. Three groups were recruited by this procedure: breast cancer with local recurrences and no metastases (42 pairs), breast cancer with only lymphatic metastases (55 pairs), and breast cancer with distant metastases (83 pairs). ANALYSIS: Cox proportional hazard models and sensitivity analyses based on subsets of the original data sets according to strict or lose application of the matching criteria. RESULTS: The results of this re-analysis are consistent with the earlier results, even when comparing different methods and subsets. In the randomised study, the effect of long-term Iscador therapy on overall survival is significantly in favour of the Iscador therapy: Estimate of the median difference and 95 % confidence interval in years 2.5 (0.83, 4.50). The results for the non-randomised studies were also in favour of the Iscador therapy: Breast cancer with local recurrences and no metastases: estimate of hazard ratio and 95 % confidence interval 0.52 (0.23, 1.17); breast cancer with lymphatic metastases: 0.27 (0.15, 0.50); breast cancer with distant metastases: 0.53 (0.32, 0.88). As a short-term effect of this therapy, psychosomatic self-regulation noticeably increases within 3 months in the Iscador group in comparison to the control group in the randomised study: estimate of the median difference 0.90 (0, 1.75). CONCLUSION: The re-analysis demonstrates that the effects shown in the previously published data are consistent despite using different analytic methods and different subsets. Overall, the survival of patients receiving mistletoe treatment with Iscador is longer in these studies. In the short term, psychosomatic self-regulation, as a measure of autonomous coping with the disease, rises more under Iscador therapy than under conventional therapy alone.",0
Neuropsychological functioning in postmenopausal breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen or exemestane after AC-chemotherapy: cross-sectional findings from the neuropsychological TEAM-side study.,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have indicated that a subset of cancer patients treated with chemotherapy show cognitive deficits and/or experience cognitive complaints, whereas literature about the influence of hormonal therapies on cognition is sparse. Because of the accumulating knowledge about the importance of estrogen for cognitive functioning, there is growing concern about adjuvant hormonal therapy for breast cancer (BC) affecting cognition. We examined the cognitive functioning of postmenopausal BC patients who were, following doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC) chemotherapy, randomized to tamoxifen or exemestane, and compared their performance with that of non-cancer controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty BC patients using tamoxifen and 50 patients using exemestane underwent interviews, questionnaires and cognitive tests, on average two years after completion of AC chemotherapy. Forty eight healthy controls were tested with similar measures. RESULTS: Memory complaints were reported by 28% of AC/tamoxifen users, 24% of AC/exemestane users and 6% of healthy controls (p=0.02). Cognitive testing revealed no statistically significant differences between tamoxifen and exemestane users, but suggested that tamoxifen use is possibly related to worse verbal functioning, while exemestane use is possibly related to slower manual motor speed. Both patient groups performed significantly worse than healthy controls on verbal fluency and information processing speed. DISCUSSION: Our findings show that sequential treatment of AC-chemotherapy and hormonal therapy in postmenopausal, primary BC is associated with lower test scores for certain cognitive functions, and provide indications for possibly distinctive associations for different types of hormonal treatment. Future research with larger groups is recommended to obtain a more definite picture.",0
Factors predicting treatment responsiveness and prognosis in node-negative breast cancer. The International (Ludwig) Breast Cancer Study Group.,"PURPOSE: An international trial (formerly Ludwig Trial V) has been conducted in 1,275 subjects to ascertain if perioperative chemotherapy is beneficial for node-negative breast cancer patients and to identify subgroups of patients who benefit from this therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Node-negative breast cancer patients were randomized to receive either one cycle of perioperative chemotherapy or no adjuvant treatment. A detailed pathology review was conducted in 1,203 of the 1,275 patients enrolled. Stepwise Cox regression analysis was used to search for factors either predicting chemotherapeutic responsiveness and/or influencing disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS: As expected, primary tumor size, grade, and the presence of peritumoral vascular invasion are the most important prognostic factors. Perioperative chemotherapy provides a DFS advantage at 5 years of median follow-up and such treatment is more effective for estrogen receptor-negative than for estrogen receptor-positive tumors, for histologic grade 2 and 3 than for grade 1 tumors, and for patients in whom no axillary lymph node metastases were found even after serial sectioning and review by the Central Pathology Laboratory. CONCLUSION: Hormone receptor status and tumor grade are important factors for predicting responsiveness to perioperative chemotherapy in node-negative breast cancer.",0
Effect of a half dose of tamoxifen on proliferative activity in normal breast tissue.,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the proliferative activity of the mammary gland epithelium and plasma levels of progesterone, estradiol, prolactin, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in premenopausal women treated with 10 and 20 mg of tamoxifen (TAM) for 22 days. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomized double-blind study was performed with 43 premenopausal women with a diagnosis of fibroadenoma of the breast. The patients were divided into three groups: A (n = 15, placebo); B (n = 15, TAM 10 mg/day) and C (n = 13, TAM 20 mg/day). They started taking an oral dose of TAM or placebo on the very first day of the menstrual cycle. Lumpectomy was performed on the 22nd day of therapy. Normal breast tissue samples were collected during surgery, immediately immersed in 10% buffered formalin, processed for routine histology and immunohistochemistry for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) detection. Two peripheral blood samples were collected, both on the 22nd day of the menstrual cycle, in order to evaluate the hormone levels. PCNA expressing epithelial cells were quantified by using a digital program Kontron Image System KS-300 in 1000 cells (400 x ). RESULTS: The percentage of cells expressing PCNA was significantly higher in the group receiving placebo (group A, 50.3%) when compared to groups receiving TAM 10 or 20 mg/day (group B, 24.1%; and group C, 23.2%, respectively) (P < 0.001). Differences between groups B and C were not significant. Levels of progesterone, estradiol and SHBG were significantly higher in B and C groups compared to group A. Increasing concentrations of FSH (P < 0.0045) and lower levels of prolactin (P < 0.0055) were only found in the group receiving 20 mg/day of TAM (group C). CONCLUSIONS: A 22-day TAM therapy, either with 10 or 20 mg/day, significantly reduced the PCNA expression and therefore the proliferative activity of the normal human breast tissue. Increasing levels of estradiol, progesterone and SHBG were associated with TAM therapy at 10 or 20 mg/day. However, a significant change of the level of FSH and prolactin was reached only with a 20-mg/day dose.",0
Health-related quality of life during hormone therapy after breast cancer: a randomized trial.,"AIM: To study the effects of menopausal hormone therapy (HT) on health-related quality of life in women after breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the Stockholm trial, breast cancer survivors were randomized to HT (estradiol and progestogen) or to a control group (no treatment). A subgroup of 75 women was studied (38 with HT, 37 controls). Fifty patients were on concomitant tamoxifen. Patients completed three questionnaires (EORTC QLQ C-30, EORTC QLQ-BR 23 and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)) during 1 year of treatment. RESULTS: A significant group-by-time interaction was found for improvement of insomnia in the HT group (p < 0.001). Within the HT group, but not in the control group, there was significant improvement for HADS anxiety, HADS depression, emotional, cognitive, and social functions and global quality of life. When HT was added to tamoxifen, the increase in global quality of life was significant (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The effects of HT on quality of life in breast cancer survivors have not previously been reported. The present data suggest that this controversial treatment may improve quality of life after breast cancer.",0
Randomized trial of dose-dense versus conventionally scheduled and sequential versus concurrent combination chemotherapy as postoperative adjuvant treatment of node-positive primary breast cancer: first report of Intergroup Trial C9741/Cancer and Leukemia Group B Trial 9741.,"PURPOSE: Using a 2 x 2 factorial design, we studied the adjuvant chemotherapy of women with axillary node-positive breast cancer to compare sequential doxorubicin (A), paclitaxel (T), and cyclophosphamide (C) with concurrent doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) followed by paclitaxel (T) for disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS); to determine whether the dose density of the agents improves DFS and OS; and to compare toxicities. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 2,005 female patients were randomly assigned to receive one of the following regimens: (I) sequential A x 4 (doses) --> T x 4 --> C x 4 with doses every 3 weeks, (II) sequential A x 4 --> T x 4 --> C x 4 every 2 weeks with filgrastim, (III) concurrent AC x 4 --> T x 4 every 3 weeks, or (IV) concurrent AC x 4 --> T x 4 every 2 weeks with filgrastim. RESULTS: A protocol-specified analysis was performed at a median follow-up of 36 months: 315 patients had experienced relapse or died, compared with 515 expected treatment failures. Dose-dense treatment improved the primary end point, DFS (risk ratio [RR] = 0.74; P =.010), and OS (RR = 0.69; P =.013). Four-year DFS was 82% for the dose-dense regimens and 75% for the others. There was no difference in either DFS or OS between the concurrent and sequential schedules. There was no interaction between density and sequence. Severe neutropenia was less frequent in patients who received the dose-dense regimens. CONCLUSION: Dose density improves clinical outcomes significantly, despite the lower than expected number of events at this time. Sequential chemotherapy is as effective as concurrent chemotherapy.",1
Randomized trial of two versus five years of adjuvant tamoxifen for postmenopausal early stage breast cancer. Swedish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group.,"BACKGROUND: Postsurgical treatment with tamoxifen has been shown to improve overall survival among patients with early stage breast cancer. However, the optimal duration of tamoxifen treatment remains controversial.PURPOSE: A multicenter, randomized trial was initiated in Sweden in the early 1980s to compare 2 years with 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen in the treatment of postmenopausal women younger than 75 years of age who had early stage, axillary lymph node-negative or -positive, invasive disease.METHODS: The trial was planned and organized by the Swedish Breast Cancer Group, and it involved five regional breast cancer study organizations (South Sweden, South-East Sweden, Stockholm, Uppsala-Orebro, and North Sweden). During the period from 1983 through 1991, a total of 3887 patients were entered in the trial; 3545 (91%) women remained alive and recurrence free at 2 years and could thus contribute meaningful information to the 2-year (n = 1801) versus 5-year (n = 1744) comparison. Primary surgery consisted of either modified radical mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery. Radiation therapy was indicated for patients with lymph node-positive disease and was generally offered to all women who were treated with breast-conserving surgery. Only 89 (2.5%) of the 3545 women who were recurrence free at 2 years received adjuvant chemotherapy concurrently with tamoxifen. Twenty-milligram daily doses of tamoxifen were used at two centers, and 40-mg daily doses were used at the remaining three centers. Estrogen receptor status of the tumor was known for 2987 women (77% of the entered patients). Primary end points in the trial were event-free survival (local-regional recurrence, distant metastasis, contralateral breast cancer, or death) and overall survival. Survival curves were estimated by use of the life-table method. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to make comparisons between the 2- and 5-year treatment groups.RESULTS: Patients assigned to receive 5 years of tamoxifen, compared with 2 years of tamoxifen, experienced statistically significant improvements in event-free survival (relative hazard = 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.71-0.96) and overall survival (relative hazard = 0.82; 95% CI = 0.69-0.99). These findings translate into an 18% relative reduction in both first events (95% CI = 4%-29%) and mortality (95% CI = 1%-31%) with the longer treatment. Overall survival at 10 years was estimated to be 80% among patients in the 5-year tamoxifen group who were alive and recurrence free at 2 years, compared with 74% among corresponding patients in the 2-year treatment group. The benefit associated with the longer treatment extended to women with lymph node-positive as well as lymph node-negative disease, but it appeared to be restricted to women whose tumors were classified as estrogen receptor positive.CONCLUSION: Five years of adjuvant tamoxifen is more beneficial than 2 years in the treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive, early stage, invasive breast cancer.",1
Quality control of end results in a Danish adjuvant breast cancer multi-center study.,"In a Danish multi-center study, quality control was performed on off-study data for high-risk breast cancer patients included in protocols of adjuvant therapy. In the two protocols 4455 patients were randomized and 2477 were registered off-study. Data from these patients were validated by reviewing the patients' records. Incorrect data were observed in 16.2% of the cases who went off-study due to recurrence, other malignant disease or death. In 258 of 2133 patients unidentical locations were demonstrated. Of these, 104 showed a time difference also. A major difference in site of recurrence was found in 107 patients (5.0%), 43 of whom were upstaged from local to a distant recurrence and 64 were downstaged. A time difference of more than 30 days was found in 192 patients (9.0%) and in 17 the difference exceeded 366 days. A time difference only was found in 88 patients (4%). The major parameter in the statistical analysis of the two protocols, i.e. recurrence-free survival, was not significantly influenced by the validation.",0
Effects on quality of life of combined trastuzumab and chemotherapy in women with metastatic breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: The study was designed to compare the effects of treatment with a combination of trastuzumab (Herceptin; Genentech, Inc, South San Francisco, CA) and chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone on health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with HER-2/neu overexpressing, metastatic breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A sample of 400 patients, not previously treated for metastatic disease and randomized to receive either trastuzumab plus chemotherapy (208 patients) or chemotherapy alone (192 patients), completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment Care Quality of Life Questionnaire at baseline and on at least one subsequent occasion at 8, 20, 32, 44, and 56 weeks. HRQL improvement or worsening was defined as a >or= 10-point change (range, 0 to 100 points) in the scores of six preselected domains (global quality of life [QOL], physical, role, social, and emotional functioning, and fatigue). Stable HRQL was defined as a change of less than 10. A Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple testing. RESULTS: After completion of chemotherapy, patients treated with trastuzumab and chemotherapy reported significant improvement in fatigue (P <.05) as compared with their baseline scores. Higher proportions of patients receiving the combined therapy achieved improvement in global QOL (P <.05) than did patients treated with chemotherapy alone. Higher proportions of the combined therapy group also achieved improvement in physical and role functioning and in fatigue as compared with the chemotherapy group, but the differences were not statistically significant. There were no differences in the proportions of patients in the two groups that reported worsening. CONCLUSION: Statistically significantly higher proportions of patients treated with a combination of trastuzumab and chemotherapy reported improved global QOL than did patients treated by chemotherapy alone.",0
"A multicenter randomized phase II study of sequential epirubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel with or without celecoxib or trastuzumab according to HER2 status, as primary chemotherapy for localized invasive breast cancer patients.","To assess anti-tumor activity of sequential epirubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel with the randomized addition of celecoxib in HER2 negative patients or trastuzumab in HER2 positive patients. From May 2004 till October 2007, 340 patients with stage II and III breast adenocarcinoma, ineligible for breast conserving surgery, received eight sequential three weekly cycles of EC-D [epirubicin (75 mg/m(2))-cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m(2)) for four cycles followed by docetaxel (100 mg/m(2)) for four cycles]. HER2-negative patients (N = 220) were randomized to receive concomitantly with docetaxel celecoxib 800 mg/day during cycles 5-8 or no additional treatment, while HER2-positive patients confirmed by FISH (N = 120) were randomized to trastuzumab concomitant to docetaxel (8 mg/kg then 6 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks) or no additional preoperative treatment. In the HER2 negative group, pCR (grade 1 and 2 of Chevallier's classification) was observed in 11.5 and 13% of patients treated without and with neoadjuvant Celecoxib, respectively. In the HER2 positive group, pCR rate reached 26% in those who received neoadjuvant trastuzumab versus 19% in the others. There was no unexpected toxicity, no cardiac toxicity, and no toxic death. Triple negative breast cancers experience the highest pCR rate of 30%. Celecoxib is not likely to improve pCR rates in addition to EC-D in patients with HER2-negative tumor. In HER2-positive tumor patients, trastuzumab added to ECD leads to increased pCR rates. It was the only combination to deserve further study according to the two-stage Fleming's design used in this trial.",1
"Randomized trial comparing six versus three cycles of epirubicin-based adjuvant chemotherapy in premenopausal, node-positive breast cancer patients: 10-year follow-up results of the French Adjuvant Study Group 01 trial.","PURPOSE: To evaluate the duration and dose intensity of epirubicin-based regimens in premenopausal patients with lymph node-positive breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1986 and 1990, 621 patients with operable breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive fluorouracil (Roche SA, Basel, Switzerland) 500 mg/m2, epirubicin (Pharmacia SA, Milan, Italy) 50 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide (Asta Medica AG, Frankfurt, Germany) 500 mg/m2 every 21 days (FEC 50) for six cycles (6 FEC 50); FEC 50 for three cycles (3 FEC 50); or the same regimen with epirubicin 75 mg/m2 (FEC 75) for three cycles (3 FEC 75). All patients in the three arms received chest wall irradiation at the end of the third cycle. RESULTS: After a 131-month median follow-up, the 10-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 53.4%, 42.5%, and 43.6% (P =.05) in the three arms, respectively. Pairwise comparisons demonstrate that 6 FEC 50 was superior both to 3 FEC 50 (P =.02) and to 3 FEC 75 (P =.05). The 10-year overall survival (OS) for the 6 FEC 50 arm was 64.3%, for the 3 FEC 50 arm it was 56.6%, and for the 3 FEC 75 arm, it was 59.7% (P =.25), respectively. Pairwise comparisons demonstrate that 6 FEC 50 was more effective than 3 FEC 50 (P =.10). Cox regression analysis demonstrates that OS was significantly better in the 6 FEC 50 than in the 3 FEC 50 arm (P =.046). No severe infections (grade 3 to 4), acute cardiac toxicity, or deaths from toxicity have been observed. Only five patients developed delayed cardiac dysfunctions, and three patients developed acute myeloblastic leukemia. CONCLUSION: After a long-term follow-up in an adjuvant setting, the benefit of six cycles of FEC 50 compared with three cycles, whatever the dose, is highly significant in terms of DFS. As regards OS, the group receiving six cycles of FEC 50 has significantly better results than the group receiving three cycles of FEC 50.",1
Adjuvant aminoglutethimide therapy for postmenopausal patients with primary breast cancer: progress report.,"A group of 122 postmenopausal patients with histologically proven node-positive primary breast cancer have been randomized to receive aminoglutethimide-hydrocortisone or placebo aminoglutethimide-placebo hydrocortisone for 2 years. Median follow-up is 17 months. In general, treatment was well tolerated, but 15 patients required a reduction in the dose of aminoglutethimide, and of these four patients were unable to continue therapy due to side effects. Primary staging, incidence of extensive node involvement, and estrogen receptor were similar in the treatment and control arms. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHA-S) and estrone were measured in a subgroup of patients, and significant suppression of DHA-S levels throughout the duration of the treatment period as seen in patients receiving the active drug. No significant suppression of either DHA-S or estrone levels was seen in the controls. Patients were monitored for metastases by serial liver function tests, carcinoembryonic antigen, and chest X-rays, and of 26 relapsing patients only three patients were not detected by this screen. We conclude that adjuvant aminoglutethimide is moderately well tolerated. It is capable of suppressing DHA-S throughout 2 years of treatment. A further 280 patients will be entered into the study to assess the survival benefit for those taking aminoglutethimide-hydrocortisone.",1
Clinical and endocrine effects of the oral aromatase inhibitor vorozole in postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer.,"Vorozole is an orally active, nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor. Twenty-four postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer who had relapsed after treatment with tamoxifen received three separate daily doses of vorozole (1, 2.5, and 5 mg) each for 1 month in a randomized, double-blind, phase II study. There was significant suppression (P < 0.001) of serum estradiol at all three doses (median reduction, 91, 90, and 89%, respectively). There was a significant trend (P = 0.02) for estradiol to be suppressed below the detection limit of the assay (3 pmol/liter) more frequently with an increasing dose of vorozole; 13, 31, and 40% respectively. Estrone and estrone-sulfate levels were likewise reduced at each dose by 52-55% and 64-69%, respectively. There was no significant effect at any dose on aldosterone, testosterone, androstenedione, 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, or thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. A small reduction in cortisol was seen at the 5 mg dose, although the relevance is unclear given that 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone levels did not rise. Eight patients (33%) achieved an objective response (2 complete remission, 6 partial remission) with a median response duration of 13 months. Four patients (17%) achieved disease stabilization for more than 6 months. Patients who had responded previously to tamoxifen were more likely to respond to vorozole. There were no significant clinical side effects and the drug was well tolerated. These data suggest that vorozole is a potent and selective oral aromatase inhibitor for use in postmenopausal breast cancer.",1
Relationship of elevated tumour thymidine phosphorylase in node-positive breast carcinomas to the effects of adjuvant CMF.,"BACKGROUND: Thymidine phosphorylase (TP) catalyses the reversible phosphorylation of thymidine to thymine and 2-deoxyribose-1-phosphate. High expression of TP in cell lines potentiates the effects of the cytotoxic drugs 5-fluorouracil and methotrexate, both of which are used in the cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil and methotrexate (CMF) treatment regimen of breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We therefore examined the expression of this enzyme in 328 invasive breast carcinomas using immunohistochemistry and assessed whether the expression of this enzyme by the tumour predicts patients response to CMF in node-positive patients. RESULTS: Whereas no significant difference in either relapse-free survival (RFS) (P = 0.2) or overall survival (OS) (P = 0.07) was observed between TP-negative and -positive tumours in non-treated patients, there was a significant increase in both RFS (P = 0.02) and OS (P = 0.02) in patients treated with CMF in TP-positive compared with TP-negative tumours. A multivariate analysis of the 134 node-positive patients demonstrated that in ductal carcinomas, TP was an independent variable for OS. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that patients with TP-positive tumours have a significant survival benefit when treated with CMF and supports the hypothesis that TP enhances tumour sensitivity to the anti-metabolites 5-fluorouracil and methotrexate.",0
The risk of amenorrhoea after adjuvant chemotherapy for early stage breast cancer is related to inter-individual variations in chemotherapy-induced leukocyte nadir in young patients: data from the randomised SBG 2000-1 study.,"STUDY AIM: Amenorrhoea is a common side-effect to chemotherapy of premenopausal women. We examine the association between chemotherapy-induced leucopaenia and the development of amenorrhoea in premenopausal women with breast cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a multi-centre, randomised, controlled study, 1016 premenopausal women received seven series of FEC (F: fluorouracil, E: epirubicin and C: cyclophosphamide) for early stage breast cancer. In the first series, all patients received standard dose (F: 600 mg/m(2), E: 60 mg/m(2) and C: 600 mg/m(2)). Patients with leukocyte nadir 1.0-1.9 x 10(9)/l continued with standard dose for the remaining six series (STANDARD(REGISTERED), n=279). Patients with leukocyte nadir > or =2 x 10(9)/l were randomised to standard (STANDARD(RANDOMISED), n=373) or increased (TAILORED, n=364) dose of E and C. After each series, leukocyte nadir was evaluated. Absent bleeding after the 5th-7th series of FEC was interpreted as amenorrhoea.RESULTS: The risk of amenorrhoea increased with age. In age-stratified analysis of the STANDARD groups (equal dose, different initial leukocyte nadir) low leukocyte nadir was associated with amenorrhoea for patients in the age-group 25-39 years (P=0.010). In age-stratified analysis in the randomised groups (different doses, same initial leukocyte nadir) a dose related increased risk of amenorrhoea was found for age-groups 25-39 (RR: 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06-1.24) and 40-44 years (RR:1.21, 95% CI: 1.001-1.47).CONCLUSION: Age is the most important risk factor of amenorrhoea after FEC chemotherapy. However, for younger patients, lower leukocyte nadir in response to STANDARD FEC treatment or increased doses of C and E were associated with increased risk of amenorrhoea.",1
Mitotic index and benefit of adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy in patients with early breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: We have evaluated whether the mitotic index could predict the benefit of adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy in patients with early breast cancer who are eligible for adjuvant chemotherapy according to Saint Gallen guidelines. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 937 patients from a single institution were included in two randomized trials that compared adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy with no chemotherapy. These patients account for 83% of the overall population included in these trials. The first trial included premenopausal patients with node-negative disease, and the second one included postmenopausal patients, regardless of lymph node status. The treatment benefit was assessed according to the number of mitoses per field (x400). RESULTS: The mitotic index was assessable in 888 patients (94%). All the patients presented as either node-positive or an average-risk breast cancer according to 2003 Saint Gallen consensus conference guidelines. The 5-year overall survival rates were 91% and 87% for patients treated or not with adjuvant chemotherapy (P = .09). In patients with low/medium mitotic index (< three mitoses/field; n = 450), the 5-year overall survival rate was 95% for patients treated or not with adjuvant chemotherapy (P = .56). In patients with high mitotic index (>/= three mitoses/field; n = 438), the 5-year overall survival rates were 86% and 79% for patients treated or not treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, respectively (P = .02). CONCLUSION: A high mitotic index is associated with the efficacy of adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy in patients eligible for adjuvant chemotherapy in daily practice.",0
Prednisolone in the treatment of severe malignant hypercalcaemia in metastatic breast cancer: a randomized study.,"To determine the effect of prednisolone on severe hypercalcaemia in women with metastatic breast cancer, 30 patients with serum ionized calcium above 1.60 mmol l-1 (reference range 1.15-1.35 mmol l-1) entered a randomized trial. Performance status before entry to the trial and survival time after hypercalcaemia were also noted. All patients received 4 l of isotonic saline daily and 80 mg intravenous furosemide three times daily for 2 d; thereafter they received 3 l of isotonic saline daily and 80 mg furosemide twice daily for 6 d. Fifteen patients were randomized to receive prednisolone, 25 mg orally, three times daily for 8 d. Serum ionized calcium decreased significantly in both groups, but most markedly in the prednisolone group. The median difference was 0.28 mmol l-1 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.09-0.52) on day 4 and 0.21 mmol l-1 (95% CI, 0.12-0.44) on day 8. In seven prednisolone-treated patients serum ionized calcium normalized, compared to none in the control group (Fisher's exact test; P = 0.028). No severe adverse effects were observed. Prior to detection of hypercalcaemia all patients were severely immobilized, primarily due to bone pain. Only 10 patients were still living after 3 months. Prednisolone, furosemide and rehydration is superior to furosemide and rehydration alone in severely hypercalcaemic patients with metastatic breast cancer in whom immobilization appears to be an early warning sign of life-threatening hypercalcaemia. The short survival time was not influenced by prednisolone.",0
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center experience with paclitaxel in the treatment of breast cancer: from advanced disease to adjuvant therapy.,"The novel chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) has received more attention than perhaps any other drug in the past two decades in its development for the treatment of breast cancer. Its unique mechanism of action, demonstrated safety profile, and significant antitumor activity in thousands of patients treated in clinical trials thus far have led to recent US Food and Drug Administration approval of its use against chemotherapy-refractory metastatic breast cancer. This report will summarize the series of clinical investigations with paclitaxel in patients with metastatic breast cancer that have been completed over the past 3 years at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and address present and future avenues of research.",0
Late effects of adjuvant chemotherapy on cognitive function: a follow-up study in breast cancer patients.,"BACKGROUND: Neuropsychological examinations have shown an elevated risk for cognitive impairment 2 years after therapy in breast cancer patients randomized to receive adjuvant high-dose cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, carboplatin (CTC) chemotherapy compared with a non-treated control group of stage I breast cancer patients. Patients randomized to receive standard-dose fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide (FEC) chemotherapy showed no elevated risk compared with controls. However, breast cancer patients treated with conventional cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil (CMF) chemotherapy showed a higher risk of cognitive impairment. The present study was designed to obtain a greater insight into these long-term neuropsychological sequelae following chemotherapy and their course in time. PATIENTS AND METHODS: At 4 years post-therapy, 22 of the original 34 CTC patients, 23 of 36 FEC patients, 31 of 39 CMF patients and 27 of 34 control patients were re-examined with neuropsychological tests. RESULTS: Improvement in performance was observed in all chemotherapy groups, whereas in the control group there was a slight deterioration in test results. A differential attrition was observed among the groups, with a relatively high percentage of initially cognitively impaired patients from the CTC group dropping out due to factors related to disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that cognitive dysfunction following adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients may be transient. Additional studies are needed to investigate the differential attrition of patients with cognitive impairment.",0

The effectiveness of scalp cooling in preventing alopecia for patients receiving epirubicin and docetaxel.,"The aim of this study was to establish the effectiveness of scalp cooling in preventing alopecia for patients with breast cancer who received the trial combination chemotherapy of Epirubicin and Docetaxel. Doubt remains about the general effectiveness of scalp cooling in preventing hair loss for patients receiving chemotherapy. There is very little information available about its specific effectiveness with combinations of Taxanes and Anthracycline drugs. Of the 40 patients who received this drug combination, 10 were included in a pilot study whereas the remaining 30 constituted the main study sample. A randomized controlled study was undertaken whereby the intervention group received scalp cooling via gel cool caps and the control group received no specific preventative intervention. Nurses assessed participants' hair loss using a modified version of the WHO scale at seven time points and also recorded hair loss photographically. Two independent experts rated the photographs using the same scale. Patients self-reported in relation to overall hair loss, hair condition, levels of emotional upset, negativity about appearance, hair re-growth and wig use. Significantly greater hair loss was apparent in the control group during most of the treatment period. However, the level of protection afforded by the cool caps was relatively poor with this chemotherapy combination. The marginal benefits of scalp cooling in this context must be clearly explained to patients.",0
Long-term controlled trial with diphosphonate in patients with osteolytic bone metastases.,Thirty-four normocalcaemic women with multiple osteolytic bone metastases from breast cancer were randomly allocated to treatment with disodium dichloromethylene diphosphonate (Cl2MDP) 1600 mg/day orally (17) or placebo (17) for 3-9 months. Fasting urinary hydroxyproline/creatinine and calcium/creatinine ratios declined in the Cl2MDP group but not in the placebo group. Four patients in the placebo group died from hypercalcaemia. New bone metastases were more common in patients on placebo and these patients also required more analgesic drugs than those on Cl2MDP. Cl2MDP seemed to reduce bone pain and bone resorption and prevent the development of hypercalcaemia caused by osteolytic metastases. The formation of new bone metastases and the growth of old ones seemed to be retarded by Cl2MDP.,0
Concurrent administration of adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery enhances late toxicities: long-term results of the ARCOSEIN multicenter randomized study.,"PURPOSE: In 1996, a multicenter randomized study was initiated that compared sequential vs. concurrent adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) with radiation therapy (RT) after breast-conserving surgery (ARCOSEIN study). After a median follow-up of 6.7 years (range, 4.3-9 years), we decided to prospectively evaluate the late effects of these 2 strategies. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 297 patients from the 5 larger participating institutions were asked to report for a follow-up examination. Seventy-two percent (214 patients) were eligible for evaluation of late toxicity. After breast-conserving surgery, patients were treated either with sequential treatment with CT first followed by RT (Arm A) or CT administered concurrently with RT (Arm B). In all patients, CT regimen consisted of mitoxantrone (12 mg/m2), 5-FU (500 mg/m2), and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2), 6 cycles (Day 1 to Day 21). Conventional RT was delivered to the whole breast by administration of a 2 Gy per fraction protocol to a total dose of 50 Gy (+/- boost to the primary tumor bed). The assessment of toxicity was blinded to treatment and was graded by the radiation oncologist, according to the LENT/SOMA scale. Skin pigmentation was also evaluated according to a personal 5-points scoring system (excellent, good, moderate, poor, very poor). RESULTS: Among the 214 evaluable patients, 107 were treated in each arm. The 2 populations were homogeneous for patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics. Subcutaneous fibrosis (SF), telangectasia (T), skin pigmentation (SP), and breast atrophy (BA) were significantly increased in Arm B. No statistical difference was observed between the 2 arms of the study concerning Grade 2 or higher pain, breast edema, or lymphedema. No deaths were caused by late toxicity. CONCLUSION: After breast-conserving surgery, the concurrent use of CT with RT is significantly associated with an increase incidence of Grade 2 or greater late side effects.",1
Combination chemotherapy for metastatic or recurrent carcinoma of the breast--a randomized phase III trial comparing CAF versus VATH versus VATH alternating with CMFVP: Cancer and Leukemia Group B Study 8281.,"PURPOSE: We sought to compare three doxorubicin-based therapies for metastatic breast cancer for response frequency, time to treatment failure (TTF), and survival. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Women with metastatic breast cancer who had measurable disease, required laboratory tests, had received no prior chemotherapy for metastases, had a Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) performance status < or = 2, and provided informed consent were eligible. Treatment included the following: arm I--cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF); arm II--vinblastine, doxorubicin, thiotepa, and halotestin (VATH); and arm III--VATH alternating with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil, vincristine, and prednisone (CMFVP) on cycles 3, 5, 7, 9, etc. Doses were modified for toxicities. Standard CALGB response and toxicity criteria were used. RESULTS: Between August 1982 and February 1987, 497 women were entered and 491 were treated on study. Pretreatment characteristics were well balanced and the median follow-up duration was 79 months. There were no significant differences in response (complete [CR] plus partial [PR]) at 50% on arm I, 57% on arm II, and 51% on arm III. The median TTFs were 8, 8, and 9 months, respectively, in favor of arm III when compared with arm I (P = .028). The median survival times for treatment arms I, II, and III were 15, 17, and 17 months, respectively. After multivariate regression analyses, only estrogen receptors (ER), performance status, and number of metastatic sites influenced TTF and survival. Leukopenia was the most common grade 3 or 4 toxicity, occurring in 90%, 80%, and 92% of patients per arm, respectively. Lethal toxicities were seen in four, five, and six women, respectively. Overall, there were more grade > or = 3 toxicities on arm II than I, and most occurred on arm III (P = .02). CONCLUSION: The VATH regimen appears similarly effective to the CAF regimen as initial therapy. Alternating CMFVP with VATH did not improve response rate or survival. After accounting for other variables, treatment arm was not related to outcome. New therapeutic regimens are still needed.",1
Bisphosphonates and metastatic breast carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: Metastasis to the skeleton occurs in approximately 75% of patients with advanced breast cancer. It is the cause of much morbidity and decreased quality of life in these patients. METHODS: Zoledronic acid (Zoledronate) is a new, potent third-generation bisphosphonate that has recently been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of both osteolytic and osteoblastic bone metastases. A Phase 3 clinical trial comparing the efficacy of Zoledronic acid 4 and 8 mg compared with Pamidronate 90 mg every 3-4 weeks has been completed. RESULTS: A 15 minute infusion of 4 mg of zoledronic acid is at least as effective as 90 mg of pamidronate in preventing skeletal complications in patients with metastatic breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Bisphosphonate treatment can delay skeletal events in patients with breast carcinoma that is metastatic to bone. Future trials will build on the results achieved with bisphosphonate treatment.",0

The impact of an aromatase inhibitor on body composition and gonadal hormone levels in women with breast cancer.,"Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have become the standard adjuvant therapy of postmenopausal breast cancer survivors. AIs induce a reduction of bioavailable estrogens by inhibiting aromatase, which would be expected to induce alterations in body composition, more extensive than induced by menopause. The objectives are to examine the impact of AIs on (1) DXA-scan derived body composition and (2) gonadal hormone levels. This is a sub-analysis of a 2-year double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of 82 women with nonmetastatic breast cancer, newly menopausal following chemotherapy, who were randomized to risedronate (35 mg once weekly) versus placebo, and stratified for their usage of AI versus no AI. Outcomes included DXA-scan derived body composition and gonadal hormone levels. As a group, total body mass increased in women over 24 months. Women on AIs gained a significant amount of lean body mass compared to baseline as well as to no-AI users (P < 0.05). Women not on an AI gained total body fat compared to baseline and AI users (P < 0.05). Free testosterone significantly increased and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) significantly decreased in women on AIs compared to no AIs at 24 months (P < 0.01) while total estradiol and testosterone levels remained stable. Independent of AI usage, chemotherapy-induced postmenopausal breast cancer patients demonstrated an increase of total body mass. AI users demonstrated maintenance of total body fat, an increase in lean body mass and free testosterone levels, and a decrease in SHBG levels compared to no-AI users. The mechanisms and implications of these changes need to be studied further.",0
Multicenter randomized trial comparing sequential with concomitant administration of doxorubicin and docetaxel as first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer: a Spanish Breast Cancer Research Group (GEICAM-9903) phase III study.,"PURPOSE: This randomized, multicenter, phase III trial evaluated whether sequential doxorubicin and docetaxel (A-->T) reduced hematological toxicity, especially febrile neutropenia, compared with concomitant (AT) administration as first-line chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer (MBC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred forty-four patients were randomly assigned to receive three cycles of doxorubicin 75 mg/m(2) every 21 days followed by three cycles of docetaxel 100 mg/m(2), every 21 days (A-->T) or six cycles of the combination doxorubicin 50 mg/m(2) and docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) (AT) every 21 days. Patients previously treated with anthracyclines received two cycles of doxorubicin followed by four cycles of docetaxel (A-->T), or three cycles of AT followed by three cycles of docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) every 21 days. RESULTS: Febrile neutropenia was less common in the A-->T arm (29.3% of patients, 6.9% of cycles) compared with the AT arm (47.8% of patients, 14.8% of cycles; P =.02 and P =.0004, respectively). Asthenia, diarrhea, and fever occurred more frequently in the AT arm. The overall responses rates were 61% in the A-->T arm (95% CI, 50% to 72%) and 51% in the AT arm (95% CI, 39% to 63%). The median duration of response was 8.7 months (A-->T) and 7.6 months (AT); the median time to progression was 10.5 months (A-->T) and 9.2 months (AT); the median overall survival was 22.3 months (A-->T) and 21.8 months (AT); and no significant differences were found. CONCLUSION: A-->T significantly reduced febrile neutropenia compared with AT in MBC patients and maintains comparable antitumoral efficacy. A-->T represents a valid option for the treatment of MBC.",1
Radiation therapy and tamoxifen after breast-conserving surgery: updated results of a 2 x 2 randomised clinical trial in patients with low risk of recurrence.,"To study the role of radiotherapy and tamoxifen after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) in patients with a favourable prognosis, a clinical trial was initiated by the German Breast Cancer Study Group (GBSG-V). Between 1991 and 1998, 361 patients (pT 1pN0M0, aged 45-75 years, receptor positive, grades I and II) were randomised to radiotherapy (yes/no) and tamoxifen for 2 years (yes/no) in a 2 x 2-factorial design; the exclusion of seven centres (14 patients) left 347 patients for the analysis. First results after a median follow-up of 5.9 years were published. Herein we present updated results after a median follow-up of about 10 years. Hundred and eleven events concerning event-free survival (EFS) have been observed. Since a strong interactive effect between radiotherapy and tamoxifen has been established, the results are presented in terms of the treatment effects for all four treatment groups separately. Mainly due to the presence of local recurrences, the event rate was much higher in the group with BCS only than in the other three groups. No significant difference could be established between the four treatment groups for distant disease-free survival rates (DDFS). Updated results give further evidence that even in patients with a favourable prognosis, the avoidance of radiotherapy and tamoxifen after BCS increases the rate of local recurrences substantially. Rates are about three times higher in the BCS only group. For the two outcomes EFS and DDFS, no important difference could be seen between the three groups with an additional treatment. However, because of the limited sample size with corresponding low power the strength of evidence for such a comparison is weak.",1
"Effects of exemestane and tamoxifen on bone health within the Tamoxifen Exemestane Adjuvant Multicentre (TEAM) trial: results of a German, 12-month, prospective, randomised substudy.","BACKGROUND: Adjuvant treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with aromatase inhibitors may be associated with increased bone loss. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred patients were randomised to receive exemestane or tamoxifen as adjuvant treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Bone mineral density (BMD) was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at baseline and after 6 and 12 months treatment. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-one patients were assessable. Tamoxifen treatment resulted in a 0.5% increase from baseline in BMD at the spine, which was maintained at 12 months. Exemestane-treated patients experienced a 2.6% decrease from baseline in BMD at the spine at 6 months and a further 0.2% decrease at 12 months. There were significant differences in the changes in BMD between tamoxifen and exemestane at 6 and 12 months (P = 0.0026 and P = 0.0008, respectively). The mean changes in BMD from baseline at the total hip were also significantly different between exemestane and tamoxifen at 6 and 12 months (P = 0.0009 and P = 0.04, respectively). There was no difference between tamoxifen and exemestane in mean changes in BMD from baseline at the femoral neck. CONCLUSIONS: Exemestane treatment resulted in an increase in bone loss at 6 months; bone loss stabilised after 6- to 12-month treatment.",1
The induction of a hypercoagulable state by medroxyprogesterone acetate in breast cancer patients.,"The effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) on the mechanism of coagulation in postmenopausal patients were studied and compared with those of tamoxifen by a retrospective analysis. The coagulation test parameters tested included platelet count, bleeding time, clotting time, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and the levels of fibrinogen, fibrin degradation products, factor II, factor V, plasminogen, alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor (alpha 2-PI) and alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor-plasmin complex (alpha 2-PI-P). A shortened APTT was noted and the levels of factors II, V, alpha 2-PI and alpha 2-PI-P were also out of the normal range during treatment in the MPA-treated group. However, these abnormal parameters recovered to within the normal range from 6 months or more after the commencement of treatment without any termination of drug administration. The patients were all asymptomatic. In contrast, a slight prolongation of bleeding time which persisted for more than 6 months was observed in the patients treated with tamoxifen. These data suggest that MPA causes a hypercoagulable state and that any change must be carefully monitored during treatment with either MPA or tamoxifen.",0
Estrogen and tibolone metabolite levels in blood and breast tissue of postmenopausal women recently diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer and treated with tibolone or placebo for 14 days.,"Unlike estrogens plus progestagens, tibolone, a selective tissue estrogenic activity regulator, does not increase breast tenderness and mammographic density. To elucidate this, serum and breast levels of tibolone and estrogenic metabolites are measured. Postmenopausal women (n = 102) with early-stage, ER(+ve), primary breast cancer received tibolone or placebo for 14 days in an exploratory, double-blind, randomized trial (STEM carcinoma tissue). Baseline and presurgery sera were collected; tumor tissues were obtained at surgery. E(1) (estrone), E(2) (estradiol), E(1)S (estrone-sulfate), tibolone-its nonsulfated, monosulfated, and disulfated 3-hydroxymetabolites-and Delta(4)-tibolone were measured by validated gas chromatography and mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry assays. More than 12 hours after the final dose, serum E(1), E(2), and E(1)S levels were unchanged with placebo, whereas tibolone significantly increased E(1)S and the E(1)S/(E(1) + E(2)) ratio. In tumors, E(1) and E(2) levels were higher than in serum, and E(1)S levels were lower, with placebo and tibolone administration. The percentage of E(1)S was about 90% in serum and 16% in tissue. Tibolone did not affect tissue levels of endogenous estrogens. Serum levels of estrogenic 3alpha- and 3beta-hydroxytibolone, progestagenic/androgenic Delta(4)-tibolone, and monosulfate metabolites were low. Serum 3alphaS,17betaS-tibolone and 3 betaS,17betaS-tibolone levels were 250 and 52 ng/mL, respectively. Tumor levels of 3alpha- and 3beta-hydroxytibolone and Delta(4)-tibolone were higher than in serum, but disulfate levels were lower. The percentage of sulfated tibolone metabolites was 99% in serum and 96% in tumor. Serum metabolite patterns of estradiol and tibolone are different from those in tissues and are compatible with neutral effects of tibolone on breast Ki67 expression.",0
Preoperative FLAC/granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor chemotherapy for stage II breast cancer: a prospective randomized trial.,"BACKGROUND: Preoperative chemotherapy for stage II breast cancer may reduce locoregional tumors and provides initial treatment for systemic micrometastases. We conducted a prospective, randomized trial to evaluate the ability of intensive preoperative chemotherapy to enhance the outcome of this approach. METHODS: Patients with clinical stage II breast cancer (T2N0, T1N1, and T2N1) were prospectively randomized to receive either preoperative or postoperative chemotherapy with five 21-day cycles of fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FLAC)/granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor. Local therapy consisted of modified radical mastectomy or segmentectomy/axillary dissection/breast radiotherapy, according to patient preference. RESULTS: Fifty-three women were randomized (26 preoperative chemotherapy and 27 postoperative chemotherapy). The objective clinical response rate of the primary tumor to preoperative chemotherapy was 80%, and the pathologic complete response rate was 20%. Preoperative chemotherapy reduced the overall incidence and number of axillary lymph node metastases. There was no difference in the use of breast-conserving local therapy between the two treatment arms. There were 20 local/regional or distant recurrences (9 preoperative and 11 postoperative). There was no difference in the overall or disease-free survival between the preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy arms. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative FLAC/granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor chemotherapy was effective against local/regional tumors in stage II breast cancer but was otherwise comparable to postoperative chemotherapy.",1
Treatment of tumour-induced hypercalcaemia in advanced breast cancer patients with three different doses of disodium pamidronate adapted to the initial level of calcaemia.,"A group of 38 female patients with advanced breast cancer experiencing the first occurrence of tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH), mostly with osteolytic progressive bone metastases, were included in a prospective calcaemia-adapted study using three different doses of pamidronate (30 mg, 45 mg and 60 mg). Serum calcium normalisation was achieved in 29/38 (76%) patients. Comparison of the response rate in three therapeutic groups confirmed the need for higher doses of pamidronate in moderate TIH. Our study also emphasised the importance of effective anticancer systemic therapy.",0
Comparative trial of endocrine versus cytotoxic treatment in advanced breast cancer.,"Ninety-two women with advanced breast cancer were allocated at random to receive either cytotoxic or endocrine treatment. Out of 45 women included in the cytotoxic treatment group, 22 (49%) achieved complete or partial remission of their disease, whereas of the 47 included in the endocrine treatment group, only 10 (21%) achieved such remission. Significantly longer survival times in the cytotoxic treatment group were most apparent among premenopausal women, 75% of such patients responding to cytotoxic drugs (median survival 46 weeks) compared with only 11% benefiting from ovarian ablation (median survival 12 weeks). In postmenopausal women with predominantly soft-tissue disease, however, additive hormonal treatment with tamoxifen produced remission rates and survival times equivalent to those produced by cytotoxic drugs.",1
"A prospective, randomized, sequential crossover trial of large-volume versus normal-volume leukapheresis procedures: effects on serum electrolytes, platelet counts, and other coagulation measures.","BACKGROUND: LVL procedures with the administration of heparin as an additional anticoagulant are increasingly performed because of the potentially higher yield of autologous peripheral blood HPCs. A prospective, randomized crossover trial was performed to evaluate the influence of leukapheresis volume-that is, large versus normal-on serum electrolytes, platelet count, and other coagulation measures in 25 patients with breast cancer and 14 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to start either with an LVL on Day 1 followed by a normal-volume leukapheresis (NVL) on Day 2 or vice versa. In LVL, heparin was administered in addition to ACD-A. Bleeding complications, transfusion support, whole-blood counts, and several coagulation measures as well as plasma heparin levels were evaluated. RESULTS: Although the duration, the infused amount of ACD-A, the flow rate, the drop in platelet count, and the drop in potassium were significantly greater in LVL, and although LVL patients also received heparin, there was no significant difference in clinical tolerance or bleeding complications. After LVL, patients exhibited a significantly longer activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), with a median of 70 seconds (range, 44-100 sec), and a median anti-factor Xa activity of 0.69 IU per mL (range, 0.10-1.29 IU/mL). The value of the APTT after LVL correlated with anti-factor Xa activity (r = 0.37, p<0.05), but not with platelet count or heparin infusion rate. Markers for coagulation activation did not increase during NVL or LVL. CONCLUSION: LVL with heparin as an additional anticoagulant seems to be a safe procedure in patients with low preleukapheresis platelet counts. No activation of coagulation occurred after NVL or LVL procedures.",0
Docetaxel vs 5-fluorouracil plus vinorelbine in metastatic breast cancer after anthracycline therapy failure.,"This multicentre, randomised phase III study compared docetaxel with 5-fluorouracil+vinorelbine in patients with metastatic breast cancer after failure of neo/adjuvant or one line of palliative anthracycline-based chemotherapy. One hundred and seventy-six metastatic breast cancer patients were randomised to receive docetaxel (100 mg m(-2)) every 3 weeks or 5-fluorouracil+vinorelbine: 5-fluorouracil (750 mg m(-2) per day continuous infusion) D1-5 plus vinorelbine (25 mg m(-2)) D1 and D5 of each 3-week cycle. Eighty-six patients received 516 cycles of docetaxel; 90 patients received 476 cycles of 5-fluorouracil+vinorelbine. Median time to progression (6.5 vs 5.1 months) and overall survival (16.0 vs 15.0 months) did not differ significantly between the docetaxel and 5-fluorouracil+vinorelbine arms, respectively. Six (7%) complete responses and 31 (36%) partial responses occurred with docetaxel (overall response rate 43%, 95% confidence interval: 32-53%), while 4 (4.4%) complete responses and 31 (34.4%) partial responses occurred with 5-fluorouracil+vinorelbine (overall response rate 38.8%, 95% confidence interval: 29-49%). Main grade 3-4 toxicities were (docetaxel vs 5-fluorouracil+vinorelbine): neutropenia 82% vs 67%; stomatitis 5% vs 40%; febrile neutropenia 13% vs 22%; and infection 2% vs 7%. There was one possible treatment-related death in the docetaxel arm and five with 5-fluorouracil+vinorelbine. In anthracycline-pretreated metastatic breast cancer patients, docetaxel showed comparable efficacy to 5-fluorouracil+vinorelbine, but was less toxic.",1
Interaction of tamoxifen with concurrent cytotoxic adjuvant treatment affects lymphocytes and lymphocyte subsets counts in breast cancer patients.,"The effects and interaction of endocrine and cytotoxic adjuvant treatment on measures of cellular immunity were assessed in 41 stage I-II breast cancer patients from International Breast Cancer Study Group trials. Counts of lymphocytes and lymphocyte subsets [(T, T4, T8, B, natural killer (NK) and activated T (AT) cells] were assessed by flow cytometry immediately before adjuvant therapy at baseline and on day 1 of the 3rd cycle. Twenty-two patients received cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF), 7 CMF and tamoxifen (TAM), and 12 TAM alone. On day 1 of the 3rd cycle the counts of total lymphocytes (P = 0.003) and all lymphocyte subsets (P<0.05) except AT cells were significantly lower than baseline in the CMF treatment group. There was no significant change in the CMF+TAM or in the TAM treatment group. The combination of CMF and TAM resulted in less pronounced decrease in lymphocyte and subset counts from baseline to day 1 of the 3rd cycle. It seems possible that there is an interaction between TAM with CMF that affects lymphocyte and lymphocyte subset counts during cytotoxic treatment.",1
The use of ultrasound for monitoring breast tumour response to pro-adjuvant therapy.,"In a prospective study, use of serial ultrasound (US) for monitoring tumour response to pro-adjuvant chemotherapy was assessed in 16 patients. Comparison was made with mammographic and pathological tumour size measurements. Clinical and radiological response to treatment was assessed using UICC (International Union Against Cancer) criteria. Comparison of clinical and US response to treatment showed some agreement in 60% and disagreement in 40%. This was comparable with clinical versus mammographic responses (55% and 45%). Correlation between calliper and pathological measurement was similar to that between US and pathological measurement (r = 0.51, P = 0.05; r = 0.50, P < 0.05). Mammography showed poorer correlation (NS). For assessment of final tumour size, US clinical measurements were comparable and better than mammography. US may be a useful tool in monitoring the response of breast tumours to pro-adjuvant therapy.",0
Safety and tolerability of testosterone patch therapy for up to 4 years in surgically menopausal women receiving oral or transdermal oestrogen.,"Two clinical trials previously demonstrated the safety of 300 μg/day transdermal testosterone patch (TTP) treatment for up to 6 months in 1094 surgically menopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). Adverse events (AE), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, physical examinations and mammograms were evaluated in open-label extensions of these two trials for up to 4 years and are presented in this article. Nine hundred and sixty-seven patients received at least one application of the TTP resulting in 1092 patient-years of exposure. There was no increase over time in the rate of new occurrences or severity of AEs, serious AEs, or withdrawals due to AEs. The most common AEs associated with treatment were application site reactions and unwanted hair growth; however, most were mild and rarely resulted in study withdrawal. No clinically meaningful changes in serum chemistry, haematology, lipid profile, carbohydrate metabolism, renal and liver function or coagulation parameters were noted with up to 4 years of therapy. Consistent with age-appropriate expected rates, three cases of invasive breast cancer were observed. No important changes in the safety or tolerability profile of TTP were revealed with long-term use for up to 4 years in otherwise healthy oophorectomised women with HSDD on concomitant oestrogen.",0
Worsening bone scan in the evaluation of antitumor response during hormonal therapy of breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: Scintigraphic flare in association with response to therapy has been well described in the medical literature. During the course of a recent breast cancer trial, it became apparent that several patients with worsening bone scan but no other clinical evidence of disease progression might have potentially benefited from continued therapy, but had therapy discontinued. A retrospective analysis of this issue was performed to assess the magnitude and scope of this problem. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 648 patients with hormone receptor-positive or unknown advanced breast cancer were treated as part of a large-scale trial of first-line hormonal therapy. Patients were assessed for response to therapy, including response duration, progression-free interval (PFI), overall survival, and quality of life. The retrospective analysis presented here was performed to assess whether patients with a possible scintigraphic flare within the first 16 weeks of therapy might have had therapy discontinued prematurely due to a worsening bone scan attributable to tumor flare, rather than due to disease progression. RESULTS: Analysis of the hormonal trial showed that of 376 assessable patients 108 (29%) with bone disease had a possible scintigraphic flare by week 8 or 16 of the trial, based on data on the case report forms and radiology reports (bone scans and x-rays). Of these, 69 patients (64%) were continued on study therapy, which resulted in clinical benefit in 50 (72%) of those patients. In contrast, 39 patients (36%) with possible scintigraphic flare were removed from the trial. CONCLUSION: We conclude that changes in bone scintigraphy that mimic progressive disease early in the course of hormonal treatment of patients with breast cancer metastatic to bone may represent scintigraphic flare associated with response. Thus, clinicians must be cognizant of the phenomenon of scintigraphic flare to avoid premature discontinuation of a potentially beneficial treatment.",0
A comparison of mitoxantrone and doxorubicin in breast cancer.,"Ninety patients with breast cancer refractory to cyclophosphamide/fluorouracil/methotrexate (CMF) have been randomized in their treatment, receiving either doxorubicin or mitoxantrone. Seventy-nine have received two full courses of therapy. Twelve of the 40 (30%) who initially received doxorubicin responded, whereas eight of the 47 (17%) who received mitoxantrone responded. These rates are not statistically different. The degree of myelosuppression was equivalent. Patients who received mitoxantrone had less nausea, vomiting, alopecia, and fatigue. Controllable clinical congestive heart failure developed in seven patients, and four others had a deterioration of noninvasive measures of cardiac function without clinical failure. One patient with clinical heart failure developing received only doxorubicin and one, only mitoxantrone, whereas the others received both agents. The duration of remission and time lapsed before disease progression were almost identical for the two regimens. This study included a crossover design. Two of 22 (10%) patients receiving doxorubicin and five of 24 (21%) receiving mitoxantrone as secondary therapy responded. This suggests that there is not absolute cross-resistance between these agents. We conclude that the efficacy of these two drugs is comparable in patients refractory to CMF, though the nonhematologic side effects of mitoxantrone are less.",1
"Is the benefit of postmastectomy irradiation limited to patients with four or more positive nodes, as recommended in international consensus reports? A subgroup analysis of the DBCG 82 b&c randomized trials.","BACKGROUND AND AIM: Numerous consensus reports recommend that postmastectomy radiotherapy (RT) in addition to systemic therapy is indicated in high-risk patients with 4+ positive nodes, but not in patients with 1-3 positive nodes. A subgroup analysis of the DBCG 82 b&c trials was performed to evaluate the loco-regional recurrence rate and survival in relation to number of positive nodes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the DBCG 82 b&c trials 3083 pre- and postmenopausal high-risk women were randomized to postoperative RT in addition to adjuvant systemic therapy. Since many patients had relatively few lymph nodes removed (median 7), the present analysis was limited to 1152 node positive patients with 8 or more nodes removed. RESULTS: The overall 15-year survival rate in the subgroup was 39% and 29% (p=0.015) after RT and no RT, respectively. RT reduced the 15-year loco-regional failure rate from 51% to 10% (p<0.001) in 4+ positive node patients and from 27% to 4% (p<0.001) in patients with 1-3 positive nodes. Similarly, the 15-year survival benefit after RT was significantly improved in both patients with 1-3 positive nodes (57% vs 48%, p=0.03) and in patients with 4+ positive nodes (21% vs 12%, p=0.03). CONCLUSION: The survival benefit after postmastectomy RT was substantial and similar in patients with 1-3 and 4+ positive lymph nodes. Furthermore, it was not strictly associated with the risk of loco-regional recurrence, which was most pronounced in patients with 4+ positive nodes. The indication for RT seems therefore to be at least equally beneficial in patients with 1-3 positive nodes, and future consensus should be modified accordingly.",0
Trastuzumab combined with chemotherapy for the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer: pivotal trial data.,"A pivotal, randomized, multicenter, phase III trial was conducted to compare chemotherapy in combination with trastuzumab (Herceptin) vs. chemotherapy (anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide [AC] or paclitaxel) alone as first-line treatment for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Results from a total of 469 patients, randomized to receive either chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy plus trastuzumab, revealed that the addition of trastuzumab improved time to disease progression significantly (7.6 vs. 4.6 months. P = 0.0001) compared with chemotherapy alone. The increase was higher in the trastuzumab plus paclitaxel subgroup (6.9 vs. 3.0 months, P = 0.0001) than in the trastuzumab plus AC subgroup (8.1 vs. 6.1 months. P = 0.0003). Patients receiving combination therapy also had a greater overall response rate (49% vs. 32%, P = 0.0002) and a longer median response duration (9.3 vs. 5.9 months, P = 0.0001) than those who received chemotherapy alone. Most importantly, median follow-up of 29 months revealed a significantly increased median survival in patients receiving trastuzumab plus chemotherapy (25.4 vs. 20.3 months, P < 0.025) compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone. Trastuzumab plus chemotherapy was well tolerated; adverse events were typically mild-to-moderate chills and fever and occurred in approximately 40% of patients, primarily following the first administration only.",1
Adjuvant therapy of breast cancer: the Southwest Oncology Group experience.,"The Southwest Oncology Group in a prospective randomized study compared one year of adjuvant combination chemotherapy with continuous CMFVP (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, vincristine, and prednisone) to two years of intermittent L-phenylalanine mustard (L-PAM) in women with operable breast cancer with histologically positive axillary lymph nodes. In fully and partially evaluable patients with a 68-month median follow-up, treatment failures have occurred in 27% of 172 receiving CMFVP and 47% of 186 women given L-PAM (p = 0.002). The advantage for women receiving CMFVP was seen for all subsets regardless of menopausal status except among women who were premenopausal and had 1-3 positive nodes. Based on this study, a second study was implemented using both the estrogen-receptor (ER) content of the primary tumor and axillary nodal status to select therapy.",1
Adjuvant endocrine therapy compared with no systemic therapy for elderly women with early breast cancer: 21-year results of International Breast Cancer Study Group Trial IV.,"PURPOSE: Increasing numbers of older women are affected by early breast cancer, because of prolonged life expectancy and the increasing incidence of breast cancer with age. The role of adjuvant therapy for this population is still a matter of debate. We reviewed the long-term outcome of a mature trial comparing endocrine treatment versus no adjuvant therapy in older women with node-positive breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1978 to 1981, 349 women 66 to 80 years of age with pathologically involved lymph nodes after total mastectomy and axillary clearance were randomly assigned to receive 12 months of adjuvant tamoxifen plus low-dose prednisone (p+T) or no adjuvant therapy. Three hundred twenty patients were eligible. RESULTS: At 21 years' median follow-up, 1 year of p+T significantly prolonged disease-free survival (DFS; P =.003) and overall survival (P =.05; 15-year DFS, 10% +/- 3% v 19% +/- 3%; hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.86). When comparing competing causes of failure (breast cancer recurrence and deaths before breast cancer recurrence), p+T was far superior in controlling breast cancer recurrence (P =.0003), but the improvement was seen mainly in soft tissue sites. Conversely, patients in the p+T group were more likely to die before a breast cancer recurrence (P =.03). CONCLUSION: This trial demonstrates that significant treatment benefits continue to be observed in older patients treated for 1 year with p+T. Despite issues relating to competing causes of failure, older breast cancer patients can benefit from treatment and should be considered for trials of adjuvant systemic therapy.",1
Endocrinological and clinical evaluation of two doses of formestane in advanced breast cancer.,"Formestane is a selective inhibitor of oestrogen synthesis by aromatase enzymes and induces disease regression in breast cancer patients. This phase II randomised study was carried out to determine whether there were any differences in the effects of two different doses of formestane on oestradiol (E2) serum levels and to evaluate the corresponding clinical activity in post-menopausal patients with positive or unknown oestrogen receptor status pretreated or not for advanced disease. Furthermore, possible drug interference with adrenal steroidogenesis was assessed by measuring 17-hydroxycorticosteroid (17-OHCS) urinary levels. A total of 143 patients entered the study and were randomly assigned to receive formestane 250 mg (72 patients) or formestane 500 mg (71 patients), both given i.m. every 2 weeks. In comparison with baseline, E2 serum levels decreased by an average of 40% after only 15 days and remained unchanged thereafter, with no difference being observed between the two doses. The values of 17-OHCS remained unchanged during treatment in both groups. Objective responses were 28% (19/69) in the 250 mg and 46% (31/68) in the 500 mg group. In conclusion, the two formestane doses were equally effective in reducing E2 levels without affecting adrenal function, and in inducing a considerable percentage of clinical responses.",1

Reduction in angiogenesis after neoadjuvant chemoendocrine therapy in patients with operable breast carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: The intensity of angiogenesis, as measured by microvessel density, is a strong independent predictor of survival in breast carcinoma patients. The impact of chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy on this process is unknown. METHODS: Histologic samples from patients randomized to a trial of neoadjuvant (NEO) versus adjuvant (ADJ) chemoendocrine therapy for operable breast carcinoma were obtained. Samples from 195 patients (90 NEO samples and 105 ADJ samples) were analyzed. Immunostaining was performed with the CD34 monoclonal antibody and the scoring of microvessels was performed using the Chalkley method. RESULTS: The median score of the NEO patients was 5.7 (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.3-6.0) and the median score of the ADJ patients was 6.3 (95% CI, 6-6.7) (P=0.025). Using previously validated scoring categories, there were fewer samples with a poor prognosis (score > or =7) in the NEO group (26%) compared with the ADJ group (32%) (P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study suggest that NEO chemoendocrine therapy causes a reduction in microvessel density in primary breast carcinomas, which could be secondary to tumor regression or due to a direct effect on angiogenesis.",0
Recurrence rates after treatment of breast cancer with standard radiotherapy with or without additional radiation.,"BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy prevents local recurrence of breast cancer after breast-conserving surgery. We evaluated the effect of a supplementary dose of radiation to the tumor bed on the rates of local recurrence among patients who received radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery for early breast cancer. METHODS: After lumpectomy and axillary dissection, patients with stage I or II breast cancer received 50 Gy of radiation to the whole breast in 2-Gy fractions over a five-week period. Patients with a microscopically complete excision were randomly assigned to receive either no further local treatment (2657 patients) or an additional localized dose of 16 Gy, usually given in eight fractions by means of an external electron beam (2661 patients). RESULTS: During a median follow-up period of 5.1 years, local recurrences were observed in 182 of the 2657 patients in the standard-treatment group and 109 of the 2661 patients in the additional-radiation group. The five-year actuarial rates of local recurrence were 7.3 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 6.8 to 7.6 percent) and 4.3 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 3.8 to 4.7 percent), respectively (P<0.001), yielding a hazard ratio for local recurrence of 0.59 (99 percent confidence interval, 0.43 to 0.81) associated with an additional dose. Patients 40 years old or younger benefited most; at five years, their rate of local recurrence was 19.5 percent with standard treatment and 10.2 percent with additional radiation (hazard ratio, 0.46 [99 percent confidence interval, 0.23 to 0.89]; P=0.002). At five years in the age group 41 to 50 years old, no differences were found in rates of metastasis or overall survival (which were 87 and 91 percent, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with early breast cancer who undergo breast-conserving surgery and receive 50 Gy of radiation to the whole breast, an additional dose of 16 Gy of radiation to the tumor bed reduces the risk of local recurrence, especially in patients younger than 50 years of age.",0
One-year outcomes of a behavioral therapy intervention trial on sleep quality and cancer-related fatigue.,"PURPOSE: To determine 1-year outcomes of a four-component behavioral therapy (BT) sleep intervention (Individualized Sleep Promotion Plan [ISPP]) versus a healthy eating control (HEC) on cancer-related fatigue in women receiving breast cancer adjuvant chemotherapy treatment (CTX).PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 219 participants from 12 oncology clinics were randomly assigned in a clinical trial. Before CTX, research nurses coached intervention participants to develop a BT plan including stimulus control, modified sleep restriction, relaxation therapy, and sleep hygiene. BT plans were revised before each CTX and 30, 60, and 90 days after the last CTX and reinforced 7 to 9 days later. HEC participants received nutritional information and equal attention. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Daily Diary, Wrist Actigraph, and Piper Fatigue Scale measures and Repeated Linear Mixed Model analysis following the Intent to Treat paradigm were used.RESULTS: Sleep quality differed over 1 years time (F [4,162] = 7.7, P < .001; by group, F [1,173] = 4.8, P = .029; and over time by group, F [4,162] = 3.3, P = .013). Pairwise comparisons revealed significant differences between groups at 90 days (P = .002) but not at 1 year (P = .052). Seven days of diary and actigraphy data did not corroborate with monthly reflections (PSQI). The night awakenings (Actigraph) pattern was significantly different by group over time (P = .046), with no differences between groups at 90 days or at 1 year. Fatigue was lower at 1 year than before CTX; no group effects were found.CONCLUSION: The BT group, on average, experienced significant improvement on global sleep quality compared with the HEC group, but not on objective sleep or fatigue outcomes.",0
Vindesine in the treatment of refractory breast cancer: improvement in therapeutic index with continuous 5-day infusion.,"Sixty patients with metastatic breast cancer refractory to prior doxorubicin combinations were randomized by performance status, dominant disease site, and number of involved organ sites to receive vindesine either as a bolus injection of 3-4 mg/m2 iv every 10-14 days or as a continuous 5-day infusion of 1-1.2 mg/m2/day every 21 days. There were two patients with partial responses (7%) and six with stable disease among the 26 evaluable patients who received bolus injections. Of the 25 evaluable patients who received continuous infusions, seven achieved a partial response (28%) and 11 had stable disease (0.001 less than P less than 0.005). Thirteen patients, after failing to respond to bolus vindesine, were given continuous infusions. Of these, 11 were evaluable and four had partial response (36%). Responses were seen in all organ sites of involvement, with response duration ranging from 2 to 9+ months. Side effects included nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, constipation, neuropathy, fever, and myelosuppression. Except for myelosuppression, which was more evident with the continuous infusion schedule, no significant difference was seen in the frequency of side effects encountered with the two schedules. These results confirmed that there is an improved therapeutic index for vindesine when it is given as a continuous 5-day infusion.",1
Cost-effectiveness of intensive adjuvant chemotherapy for high-risk breast cancer: is tailored and dose-escalated chemotherapy with growth factor support (GFS) more costly and less effective than marrow-supported high-dose chemotherapy - results from a randomized study.,"Based on randomized studies bone-marrow supported (BMS) high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) is not superior to conventional CT as adjuvant treatment for high-risk breast cancer. To compare the cost-effectiveness of these treatments we examined the data of Finnish patients in the SBG9401 trial 1. Patients were randomized to receive either dose-escalated (de FEC) (group A, n =59) or FEC and HDCT+BMS (group B, n =70). They received adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) + tamoxifen. All direct health care costs of first line treatment at the oncology units were considered as well as productivity costs within the first 3 years of follow-up. Effectiveness was measured by the number of survival days during 5 years of follow-up. The mean direct health care costs were significantly higher in group B (25829 euro in group A vs. 36605 euro in group B, p <0.001), mainly due to a higher number of hospital days. Half of the costs in group A was due to the use of filgrastim (15335 euro in A and 2969 euro in B, p <0.001). The costs of RT were only 5% of total costs. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in the number of survival days, but sensitivity analysis based on bootstrapping suggested that treatment A would be a less costly and more effective alternative in a great majority of cases.",0
Randomized trial of letrozole following tamoxifen as extended adjuvant therapy in receptor-positive breast cancer: updated findings from NCIC CTG MA.17.,"BACKGROUND: Most recurrences in women with breast cancer receiving 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen occur after 5 years. The MA.17 trial, which was designed to determine whether extended adjuvant therapy with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole after tamoxifen reduces the risk of such late recurrences, was stopped early after an interim analysis showed that letrozole improved disease-free survival. This report presents updated findings from the trial. METHODS: Postmenopausal women completing 5 years of tamoxifen treatment were randomly assigned to a planned 5 years of letrozole (n = 2593) or placebo (n = 2594). The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS); secondary endpoints included distant disease-free survival, overall survival, incidence of contralateral tumors, and toxic effects. Survival was examined using Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank tests. Planned subgroup analyses included those by axillary lymph node status. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 30 months (range = 1.5-61.4 months), women in the letrozole arm had statistically significantly better DFS and distant DFS than women in the placebo arm (DFS: hazard ratio [HR] for recurrence or contralateral breast cancer = 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.45 to 0.76; P < .001; distant DFS: HR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.43 to 0.84; P = .002). Overall survival was the same in both arms (HR for death from any cause = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.57 to 1.19; P = .3). However, among lymph node-positive patients, overall survival was statistically significantly improved with letrozole (HR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.38 to 0.98; P = .04). The incidence of contralateral breast cancer was lower in women receiving letrozole, but the difference was not statistically significant. Women receiving letrozole experienced more hormonally related side effects than those receiving placebo, but the incidences of bone fractures and cardiovascular events were the same. CONCLUSION: Letrozole after tamoxifen is well-tolerated and improves both disease-free and distant disease-free survival but not overall survival, except in node-positive patients.",1
Good clinical response of breast cancers to neoadjuvant chemoendocrine therapy is associated with improved overall survival.,"BACKGROUND: We present extended follow-up from a prospective randomised trial evaluating the role of neoadjuvant chemoendocrine therapy in the treatment of operable breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 309 women were randomised to primary surgery followed by eight cycles of adjuvant mitoxantrone, methotrexate with tamoxifen (2MT) or 2MT with mitomycin-C (3MT) versus the same regimen for four cycles before followed by four cycles after surgery. For this analysis the median follow-up of patients was 112 months. RESULTS: After 10 years follow-up there is still no statistically significant difference in disease-free survival (DFS) (71% versus 71%) or overall survival (OS) (63% versus 70%) when comparing adjuvant versus neoadjuvant treatment, respectively. Of 144 evaluable patients in the neoadjuvant arm, 74 achieved a good clinical response and 70 patients achieved a poor clinical response. Good responders had a superior DFS (80% versus 64%, P=0.01) and OS (77% versus 63%, P=0.03) compared to poor responders. CONCLUSIONS: At 10 years, neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment continue to have equivalent OS and DFS. Good clinical response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with superior DFS and OS. This supports the use of clinical response of primary breast cancer to neoadjuvant therapy as a surrogate marker of survival benefit.",0
"Lack of effectiveness of adjuvant alternating chemotherapy in node-positive, estrogen-receptor-negative premenopausal breast cancer patients: results of a multicentric Italian study. The Breast Cancer Adjuvant Chemo-Hormone Therapy Cooperative Group (GROCTA).","A multicentric randomized trial was performed in premenopausal women with node-positive, estrogen-receptor-negative breast tumors to assess the potential superiority of alternating adjuvant chemotherapy over 'standard' CMF chemotherapy. Between January 1989 and June 1992, 107 patients were entered into the study and randomly allocated to receive either cyclophosphamide 100 mg/m2 per as on days 1-14, methotrexate 40 mg/m2 and 5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m2 intravenously (i.v.) on days 1, 8 (CMF), every 4 weeks for a total of 6 cycles, or the following regimens: CMF as previously; epidoxorubicin 75 mg/m2 i.v. on day 1 and vincristine 0.75 mg/m2 i.v. on days 1, 8 (EV); mitomycin-C 10 mg/m2 i.v. on day 1 and vindesine 2 mg/m2 i.v. on days 1, 8 (MVs). The three regimens were given every 4 weeks for a total of 6 cycles according to the following schedule: CMF, EV, MVs, CMF, EV, MVs. At a median follow up of 48 months (range 30-72), 40 patients have relapsed and 17 have died overall. More patients in the triple-combination arm have relapsed and more have died, the latter difference tending toward statistical significance (p = 0.06). There was no statistical difference in the site of relapse between the two groups. Total duration of adjuvant therapy was similar in the two arms (312 chemotherapy cycles in the triple arm and 308 in the CMF arm). Treatment toxicity was also comparable, although more patients in the triple-combination arm were still regularly menstruating 6 months after the completion of chemotherapy. This study failed to show any advantage ensuing from the use of alternating chemotherapy in patients with early breast cancer.",1
A prospective randomized comparison of epirubicin and doxorubicin in patients with advanced breast cancer.,"Fifty-four patients with advanced breast cancer who had failed prior non-anthracycline combination chemotherapy were randomized to treatment with either epirubicin 85 mg/m2 or doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 intravenously every three weeks. Of 52 evaluable patients, 25% (six of 24) treated with epirubicin, and 25% (seven of 28) treated with doxorubicin experienced major therapeutic responses. The median duration of response to epirubicin was 11.9 months compared to 7.1 months with doxorubicin. Cardiotoxicity was monitored by serial multigated radionuclide cineangiocardiography performed at rest and after exercise. Laboratory evidence of cardiotoxicity was defined as a decrease in resting left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 10% from the baseline value, or a decrease of 5% or greater with exercise compared with the resting study performed on the same day. Fifteen patients treated with epirubicin and 18 patients treated with doxorubicin had at least two determinations of left ventricular ejection fraction and were evaluable for laboratory cardiotoxicity. Using methods of survival analysis, the median doses to the development of laboratory cardiotoxicity were estimated to be 935 mg/m2 of epirubicin and 468 mg/m2 of doxorubicin. Four patients treated with epirubicin and five treated with doxorubicin developed symptomatic congestive heart failure. The median cumulative dose at which congestive heart failure occurred was 1,134 mg/m2 of epirubicin compared with 492 mg/m2 of doxorubicin. Fewer episodes of nausea and vomiting were observed in patients receiving epirubicin. Epirubicin is a new anthracycline with reduced cardiac toxicity, but preserved efficacy in the treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer.",1
The use of chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer.,"Recurrent breast cancer is incurable. Chemotherapeutic agents will be used in most patients with metastatic disease at some time during their course. There is little evidence that such agents prolong survival, and their toxicities are not inconsiderable. The focus of treatment should be on the palliation of symptoms. Single-agent regimens should not be assumed to be less effective than combinations, particularly as salvage therapies. Some new approaches to the management of metastatic disease are explored.",0
Combination versus sequential five-drug chemotherapy in metastatic carcinoma of the breast.,"Patients with metastatic or recurrent adenocarcinoma of the breast were randomized to weekly combination chemotherapy, intermittent combination chemotherapy, or single-drug chemotherapy administered sequentially. Patients receiving weekly combination therapy were more likely to respond than those receiving single-drug therapy (5-fluorouracil). The median survival for either group treated with combination therapy was double that of patients on sequential therapy. One-fourth of the patients had a prolonged survival (greater than 75 weeks), regardless of therapy.",1
"Mitomycin C, methotrexate, and vincristine with medroxyprogesterone acetate or prednisolone for doxorubicin resistant advanced breast cancer--a randomized control study.","This randomized study was designed to compare the efficacy and toxicity of MMV chemotherapy (mitomycin C(MMC), methotrexate (MTX) and vincristine(VCR)), MMVM (MMV+medroxyprogesterone acetate(MPA)) and MMVP (MMV+prednisolone(P)), and to evaluate potential additional effects of MPA or P to the chemotherapy in doxorubicin (ADR)-refractory cancer patients. A total of 108 advanced breast cancer patients who had been resistant to ADR or who had relapsed after response were randomized to the three treatment arms: MMC 4mg/m2, MTX 35mg/m2 and VCR 0.7mg/m2, i.v., on days 1 and 8; repeated every 3 weeks. MPA 1,200 mg/day or P 10mg/day was given orally in the MMVM and MMVP arms, respectively. An interim analysis showed that the response to MMV was marginally significantly lower than the other groups; entry to the arm was thus interrupted. 102 patients were evaluable. Totally, response rates of 9.5%(2/21) in MMV, 37.5%(15/40) in MMVM and 29.2%(12/41) in MMVP were obtained. There was a significant difference in the response between the MMVM and MMV arms (p = 0.0206), and a marginal difference between MMVP and MMV (p = 0.0784). Although overall survivals in the 3 groups were equivalent, the time to progression of patients treated with MMVM and MMVP was shown to be significantly longer than MMV patients. Hematological adverse effects, especially thrombocytopenia, were significantly diminished by the addition of hormones, particularly MPA, to the chemotherapy, thus increasing total doses of chemotherapeutic agents. It was shown that in ADR-resistant cancers MMVM had an effect equivalent to that in ADR-sensitive breast cancers. The authors conclude that MMVM may be a candidate for a noncross resistant regimen for ADR-resistant cancers, as well as an effective 2nd line chemoendocrine treatment of advanced breast cancer.",1
Aromatase inhibitor-induced carpal tunnel syndrome: results from the ATAC trial.,"PURPOSE: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a condition in which the median nerve is compressed, leading to pain and muscle weakness in the fingers and hand. Aromatase inhibitors lead to profound estrogen suppression and may be expected to increase the risk of CTS in postmenopausal women receiving adjuvant therapy for early breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The current analyses were based on the 100-month median follow-up data in postmenopausal women in the two monotherapy arms (anastrozole, n = 3,092; tamoxifen, n = 3,094). Here, we investigate the natural history of patients who presented with CTS during adjuvant treatment for breast cancer and the relative importance of a range of known risk factors for CTS. RESULTS: After 100 months of follow-up, 80 cases (2.6%) of CTS were reported in the anastrozole arm, compared with 23 cases (0.7%) in the tamoxifen arm (P < .0001). The majority of CTS cases were reported as mild to moderate intensity and occurred early. None of the women stopped treatment medication as a result of CTS. CTS was significantly increased for women who used prior hormone replacement therapy (P = .007) or received prior chemotherapy (P = .01). Those who were 60 years of age or older at entry were at lower risk of CTS compared with their counterparts (P = .002). CONCLUSION: Although the use of anastrozole is associated with a greater incidence of CTS, it is rare, and most cases were of mild to moderate intensity and short duration. CTS has little impact on the overall risk-to-benefit ratio for the use of anastrozole in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer.",0
Randomized phase II trial of the anti-angiogenic potential of doxorubicin and docetaxel; primary chemotherapy as Biomarker Discovery Laboratory.,"PURPOSE: Primary chemotherapy provides an ideal opportunity to correlate potential non-invasive surrogate markers of angiogenesis with tumor microvessel density (MVD) and response. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed stages II or III breast cancer were treated with sequential doxorubicin 75 mg/M2 q2 wks x 3 and docetaxel 40 mg/M2 weekly x 6; treatment order was randomly assigned. Potential serologic and imaging markers of angiogenesis were obtained pre-treatment, at crossover and completion of chemotherapy. Non-invasive biomarkers were correlated with MVD and pathologic response. RESULTS: From June 1999 to October 2002, 70 patients were entered. Median pretreatment tumor diameter was 6.0 cm with clinically involved axillary nodes in 33 (47%) patients; 20% had inflammatory disease. Clinical response rate was 91%, including 46% clinical complete responses. Pathologic complete response (pCR) was confirmed in 9 (12.8%) patients. Baseline MVD did not correlate with clinical or pathologic response. Serologic markers were obtained in all patients; basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was lower at baseline and increased during treatment in patients with a pCR but did not correlate with MVD. Color Doppler ultrasound (CDUS) was completed in 47 patients; no parameter reliably correlated with MVD or response. Positron emission tomography (PET) with [F-18]-fluoro-deoxyglucose, [O-15]-water and [C-11]-carbon monoxide were completed in 19 patients; uptake of all tracers decreased during treatment in virtually all patients. CONCLUSION: Sequential doxorubicin and docetaxel is generally well tolerated and highly active. Serum angiogenic factors and imaging parameters frequently varied throughout treatment but did not correlate with MVD or consistently predict response.",1
Cost-effectiveness of raloxifene in the UK: an economic evaluation based on the MORE study.,"Raloxifene treatment has been shown to reduce the risk of vertebral fractures and breast cancer in postmenopausal women. The long-term economic implications of treatment with raloxifene have not yet been investigated. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of treating postmenopausal women in the UK with raloxifene. A previously developed computer simulation model was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of osteoporotic treatments with extra skeletal benefits. The model was populated with epidemiological data and cost data relevant for a UK female population. Data on the effect of treatment were taken from the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene (MORE) study, which recruited women with low bone mineral density or with a prior vertebral fracture. Cost-effectiveness was estimated using Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) and life years gained as primary outcome measures. The cost per QALY gained of treating postmenopausal women without prior vertebral fractures was 18,000 pounds, 23,000 pounds , 18,000 pounds and 21,000 pounds at 50, 60, 70 and 80 years of age. Corresponding estimates for women with prior vertebral fractures were 10,000 pounds, 24,000 pounds, 18,000 pounds and 20,000 pounds. In relation to threshold values that are recommended in the UK, the analysis suggests that raloxifene is cost-effective in the treatment of postmenopausal women at an increased risk of vertebral fractures.",0
Serum estradiol level and risk of breast cancer during treatment with raloxifene.,"CONTEXT: As endogenous estradiol increases, risk of breast cancer increases. Raloxifene competes with endogenous estrogen for binding to estrogen receptors in breast tissue. A woman's estradiol level may alter the effects of raloxifene on breast cancer and other outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that raloxifene reduces breast cancer risk more in women with relatively high estradiol levels than in women with very low estradiol levels. DESIGN: Analysis of the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted from 1994 to 1999. SETTING: One hundred eighty community settings and medical practices in 25 countries including the United States. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 7290 postmenopausal women aged 80 years or younger with osteoporosis who had baseline serum estradiol concentrations measured by a central laboratory using a sensitive assay. Women with a history of breast cancer or estrogen use were excluded. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned to receive 60 mg/d or 120 mg/d of raloxifene (n = 4843) or matching placebo (n = 2447) for 4 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: New cases of histopathologically confirmed breast cancer in the treatment and placebo groups, stratified by estradiol levels. RESULTS: In the placebo group, women with estradiol levels greater than 10 pmol/L (2.7 pg/mL) had a 6.8-fold higher rate of breast cancer (3.0% per 4 years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8%-4.1%) than that of women with undetectable estradiol levels (0.6% per 4 years; 95% CI, 0%-1.1%; P =.005 for trend). Women with estradiol levels greater than 10 pmol/L in the raloxifene group had a rate of breast cancer that was 76% (95% CI, 53%-88%) lower than that of women with estradiol levels greater than 10 pmol/L in the placebo group (absolute rate reduction, 2.2% [95% CI, 1.0%-3.5%; number needed to treat = 45]). In contrast, women with undetectable estradiol levels had similar breast cancer risk whether or not they were treated with raloxifene (risk difference, -0.1%; 95% CI, -0.8% to 0.6%; P =.02 for the interaction). In this cohort, treating women with estradiol levels greater than 10 pmol/L with raloxifene for 4 years would have avoided 47% of breast cancer cases. CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of estradiol level by sensitive assay in postmenopausal women identifies those at high risk of breast cancer who may benefit most from raloxifene. If confirmed, this suggests that measuring estradiol and treating women with high estradiol levels could substantially reduce the rate of breast cancer among postmenopausal women.",0
Thirty-year follow-up of chemo/hormonal therapy in node-positive breast cancer.,"Results of a thirty-year follow-up of a clinical trial of chemo-hormonal therapy are reported. Eligible patients had recently diagnosed operable breast cancer, positive lymph nodes, no previous history of cancer, age less than 76 years, and no evidence of metastatic disease. A total of 311 patients were stratified by estrogen receptor (ER) status and number of axillary nodes involved with tumor. After stratification, patients were randomly assigned to one of three treatment regimens: cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) for 1 year; CMF chemotherapy combined with anti-estrogen therapy (tamoxifen) for 1 year; or CMF plus tamoxifen with BCG during the second year. The endpoint of the trial was a first recurrence. Factors measured at diagnosis and used in the analyses were age, body mass index, ER status, menopausal status, number of positive nodes, tumor diameter, Charlson comorbidity index, socioeconomic status, and race. Causes of death and incidence of other cancer primaries were obtained from death certificates and medical records. Patients treated with tamoxifen had a marginally longer disease-free survival (hazard ratio (HR)=0.83, 95% CI identical with [0.66, 1.04]) and statistically significant longer overall survival (HR=0.77, 95% CI identical with [0.63, 0.96]) that decreased with time. Incidence of other primary cancers and causes of death were similar for the two treatment groups. The addition of 1 year of tamoxifen to CMF therapy provides an early disease-free and overall survival advantage; however long-term effects are negligible. Similarly, the survival advantage of patients diagnosed with ER+ tumors persists for the first two decades after diagnosis.",0
"Mitoxantrone, 5-fluorouracil and high-dose leucovorin (NFL) in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer: randomized comparison to cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) and attempts to improve efficacy by adding paclitaxel.","The combination of mitoxantrone (12 mg/m2 i.v., day 1) 5-fluorouracil (350 mg/m2 i.v. days 1-3) and leucovorin (300 mg i.v. days 1-3) is an active and well-tolerated regimen for metastatic breast cancer. We compared this regimen to a standard CMF regimen (cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 i.v. day 1, methotrexate 40 mg/m2 day 1; 5FU 600 mg/m2 i.v. day 1) in a randomized, phase II study. One hundred and twenty-eight women receiving first-line chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer were treated. NFL produced higher response rates (45% vs. 26%) and longer remissions (9 months vs. 6 months) than did CMF; overall survival was not different (19 months vs. 16 months). Both regimens were well tolerated. In an attempt to improve efficacy, we added paclitaxel (135 mg/m2 i.v. 1-h infusion) to the NFL regimen. Although this regimen was active (51% response rate in first-second-line treatment), myelosuppression was greater than expected. These results confirm the utility of NFL as an active, well-tolerated regimen for the palliative treatment of metastatic breast cancer.",1
Dose intensification of epidoxorubicin and cyclophosphamide in metastatic breast cancer: a randomised study with two schedules of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor.,"A randomised phase II/III study was conducted in patients with advanced breast cancer to determine the dose intensity achievable through an acceleration of administration of chemotherapy with epidoxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (EC) alone, as compared with the combination of this regimen with two different schedules of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). 73 patients received EC intravenous (i.v.) (epidoxorubicin 100 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2) on day 1 (group A), or the same chemotherapy plus sub-cutaneous (s.c.) GM-CSF (5 micrograms/kg/day) either from days 3 to 12 (group B) or from days -6 to -3 (group C). The primary objective of the study was the investigation of dose intensity delivered in the three treatment arms, whereas the secondary objective was response rate. A significant increase (P = 0.006) in dose intensity of 21% was observed for treatment group B, whereas the increase in dose intensity achieved in group C (7%) was not significant (P = 0.086). Response rates (complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)) of 56% were observed in group A, 65% in group B, and 57% in group C, respectively. This difference in response rates did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.271). We thus conclude that an acceleration of the EC regimen over the standard schedule could be accomplished with postchemotherapeutic GM-CSF support, leading to an increase in dose intensity, whereas pretherapeutic short-term GM-CSF administration did not reach this goal.",0
Efficacy of subcutaneous and topical local anaesthesia for pain relief after resection of malignant breast tumours.,"OBJECTIVE: Infiltration and topical application of local anaesthetics close to the surgical wound may be used to prevent postoperative pain. We evaluated the efficacy of these treatments after breast surgery for cancer. DESIGN: Double-blind randomised trial with two treatment groups and one control group. SETTING: University hospital, Sweden. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were allocated to treatment with bupivacaine infiltration (n = 29), topical application of lignocaine/prilocaine (n = 31), or no local treatment (n = 30). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Difference and time related patterns in pain scores measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS), and morphine consumption. RESULTS. None of the local anaesthetics significantly reduced the VAS score or morphine consumption. However, fewer patients in the anaesthetic groups had high VAS scores than controls, the 75 centile for the mean score after operation being 2.7, 2.0 and 2.1 for the controls, infiltration, and topical anaesthetic groups, respectively. The controls had higher scores from 6 hours postoperatively onwards. The corresponding median morphine consumption was 24.5, 18.5, and 16.2 mg. CONCLUSIONS. Local anaesthesia slightly reduced the overall pain scores and the morphine consumption, but was of potential clinical value only in the patients who had the highest pain scores.",0
Decreased use of adjuvant breast cancer therapy in a randomized controlled trial of a decision aid with individualized risk information.,"OBJECTIVE: Oncology patients often seek involvement in their medical consultations. Such involvement is endorsed by most health care providers and mirrored in practice guidelines. However, oncologists exhibit great variation in how they provide patients with disease-relevant information, and many remain reluctant to do so at all. The authors examined the impact of a patient-specific decision aid on women's decisions about adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. METHOD: 386 women with breast cancer were randomized to receive either an informational pamphlet about adjuvant therapy (usual care) or a patient-specific, evidence-based decision aid about adjuvant therapy. The authors compared rates of adjuvant therapy between the groups controlling for age, education, marital status, race, tumor severity, and practice type of their physician (university-based or community-based). RESULTS: Among women with low tumor severity, only 58% (35/60) of women in the decision aid group chose adjuvant therapy, compared to 87% (33/38) of their counterparts in usual care (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the important impact of medical decision aids on treatment choices, particularly for patients for whom treatment has little benefit. In the case of adjuvant therapy for breast cancer, providing individualized, evidence-based risk information for shared decision making resulted in fewer women with low tumor severity choosing adjuvant treatment.",0
Adjuvant therapy of premenopausal and menopausal high-risk breast cancer patients. Present status of the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group Trials 77-B and 82-B.,"From September 1977 to November 1987 high-risk (i.e. with positive axillary lymph nodes, or tumor size greater than 5 cm or skin/facia invasion) premenopausal and menopausal breast cancer patients have been included in 2 randomized trials. In both trials the primary surgical treatment was total mastectomy with axillary sampling. In the first trial (DBCG 77-B) 1034 patients all received postoperative radiotherapy (RT) and were further randomized to 1) no systemic treatment (0), 2) cyclophosphamide (C), or 3) cyclophosphamide + methotrexate + 5-fluorouracil (CMF). The chemotherapy was given for 1 year. With a median observation time of 7 years the actuarial survival after 9 years is 50, 60 and 65% respectively. Retrospectively, the survival benefit was observed to be most pronounced in patients with tumor size less than or equal to 5 cm and with less than or equal to 3 positive lymph nodes. In the subsequent study initiated in 1982 (82-B) all patients received CMF for 9 months. Furthermore they were randomized to 1) RT, 2) no further treatment, or 3) tamoxifen (TAM) for 1 year. As of November 1, 1987, 1308 patients have been included. At 4 years and with a median observation time of 2 years the survival is similar in the 3 groups. In conclusion, in high-risk premenopausal and menopausal patients adjuvant chemotherapy combined with RT resulted in a 20-30% relative reduction in mortality at 9 years compared with RT alone. Preliminary analysis of adjuvant CMF + RT, compared with CMF alone or with CMF + TAM, shows after a median observation time of more than 2 years no significant survival differences.",1
Effects of tamoxifen and octreotide LAR on the IGF-system compared with tamoxifen monotherapy.,"The insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-system was evaluated in 150 breast cancer patients participating in a randomised phase III trial comparing octreotide pamoate and tamoxifen with tamoxifen+placebo. Alterations in the IGF-system in the two treatment arms and individual changes with respect to outcome were compared. Serum IGF-I and -II, free IGF-I, and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1-3 (IGFBP1-3) were measured by radioimmmunoassay (RIA)/immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) and IGFBPs by Western ligand blots (WLB) before and during treatment. Combined treatment caused a higher increase in IGFBP-1 and larger suppression of total and free IGF-I, IGF-II, and IGFBP-3 (P<0.01 for all), but less suppression of IGFBP-2 (P<0.05) compared with tamoxifen monotherapy. An increase in IGFBP-2 25% was associated with decreased progression-free survival (PFS) in the total patient population and combined treatment group. Similar response rates and time to progression in the treatment arms suggests moderate suppression of circulating IGF-I has no influence on clinical outcome.",0
Treatment of metastatic breast cancer in premenopausal women using CAF with or without oophorectomy: an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Study.,"One hundred thirty-one premenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer who had received no prior systemic treatment for metastases were entered on study. Patients without prior chemotherapy with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and ER-unknown disease were randomized to receive cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), and 5-fluorouracil (CAF) or surgical oophorectomy followed directly by CAF (O + CAF). ER-negative patients without prior chemotherapy were directly assigned to treatment with CAF. Among randomized patients 83% have responded, and 37% have achieved a complete remission. Among ER-negative patients the complete response rate was 38%, and the complete plus partial response rate was 70%. Characteristics significantly associated with a longer time to treatment failure were age 45 or over, one or two organ sites, and performance status O. The median survival time of ER-positive patients treated with CAF is 29 months, and with O + CAF it has not yet been reached, whereas for ER-unknown patients the equivalent survival times are 41 months and 43 months respectively. For ER-negative patients treated with CAF the median survival time is 17 months. Characteristics associated with significantly longer survival among randomized patients were age 35 or over (P = .009) and only one or two organ sites involved (P = .02). Neither treatment (P = .33) nor ER status (P = .70) was significant.",0
"CMF versus goserelin as adjuvant therapy for node-negative, hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer in premenopausal patients: a randomised trial (GABG trial IV-A-93).","Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues were investigated as adjuvant treatment for patients with node-negative, hormone-sensitive, premenopausal breast cancer. Patients were randomised to either three cycles of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) chemotherapy (n=378) or goserelin every 28 d for 2 years (n=393). During a median follow-up of 4.9 years, 123 events were observed. The first-failure event of CMF versus goserelin, respectively, was ipsilateral locoregional recurrence (18 versus 20), contralateral breast cancer (7 versus 6), distant failure (35 versus 24) and death without recurrence (2 versus 2). Forty-two (23 versus 19) deaths of any cause occurred. The estimated adjusted hazard ratio for goserelin versus CMF (intention-to-treat analysis) was 0.79 (95% CI=0.54-1.14; P=0.19). It is concluded that medical ovarian ablation with goserelin represents a valid option for premenopausal patients with node-negative breast cancer.",1
Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy for operable breast cancer induces apoptosis.,"The use of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (often referred to as pre-operative or primary chemotherapy) represents a major change in the management of breast cancer as a systemic disease. Laboratory studies have shown that many anti-cancer agents with differing modes of action achieve cytotoxic effects by inducing apoptosis. In this study, we investigated the induction of apoptosis by neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in human breast cancer. The aim was to determine whether a correlation existed between post chemotherapy apoptotic index (AI) and clinical response and patients' survival. Our results indicate that apoptosis is induced by neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and that the response is variable. Our data show that post chemotherapy AI correlated with clinical response and increased patient survival, including both relapse (disease) free survival and overall survival. Post-neo-adjuvant chemotherapy AI levels in primary breast cancer may possibly predict an individual patient's overall response.",1
Preventing relapse beyond 5 years: the MA.17 extended adjuvant trial.,"For patients with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer, the risk of relapse remains significant even after successfully completing 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen. The use of tamoxifen beyond 5 years is not recommended, but the need to protect against relapse following tamoxifen is clear. The third-generation aromatase inhibitors offer a new approach to treating postmenopausal women with receptor-positive early stage breast cancer through the potent and specific systemic inhibition of estrogen synthesis. MA.17, a large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study, investigated whether extended adjuvant therapy with letrozole following completion of around 5 years of standard tamoxifen therapy could prolong disease-free survival in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive or receptor-unknown early stage breast cancer. The updated analyses of the trial results (median follow-up, 2.5 years) confirm that letrozole significantly reduced the risk of recurrent breast cancer (42%) regardless of the patient's nodal status or receipt of prior chemotherapy, and significantly reduced the risk of distant metastasis (40%). Importantly, letrozole as extended adjuvant therapy achieved a significant improvement in overall survival in women with node-positive disease. Mortality was reduced by 39% among the approximately 2,500 women with node-positive disease randomized in the study. Letrozole showed minimal side effects compared with placebo; adverse effects on bone metabolism of uncertain clinical significance were the most noteworthy side effect. Thus, the updated results from the MA.17 trial support the previous findings and show extended adjuvant therapy with letrozole to be a well-tolerated protection against the continuing risk of breast cancer recurrence for thousands of women currently receiving standard adjuvant tamoxifen. The re-randomization of MA.17 patients to an additional 5 years of letrozole or to no treatment will provide further insights into the benefits and side effects of long-term treatment.",0
Docetaxel compared with sequential methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil in patients with advanced breast cancer after anthracycline failure: a randomised phase III study with crossover on progression by the Scandinavian Breast Group.,"The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of docetaxel to methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil in advanced breast cancer after anthracycline failure. A randomised multicentre trial was conducted in 283 patients with advanced breast cancer who had failed previous anthracycline treatment. Docetaxel at a dose of 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks (n = 143) was compared with sequential methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (MF; n = 139) given at day 1 and 8 every 3 weeks at dosages of 200 mg/ m2 and 600 mg/m2, respectively. After progression, crossover to the alternative treatment group was recommended. There was a significantly higher overall response rate in the docetaxel 42% (CR 8% + PR 34%) than in the MF arm 21% (CR 3% + PR 18%) (P < 0.001). The median time to progression (TTP) was 6.3 months in the docetaxel arm and 3.0 months in the MF arm (P < 0.001). Docetaxel also had a significantly higher response rate of 27% following crossover compared with MF (12%). Significantly more side-effects (leucopenia, infections, neuropathy, oedema, asthenia, skin, nail changes, alopecia) were seen in the docetaxel than in the MF group. However, grade 3 and 4 side-effects were infrequent with both drugs, with the exception of fatigue, alopecia and infections. Median overall survival (OS) including crossover phase was 10.4 months in the docetaxel and 11.1 months in the MF arm (P = 0.79). Based on the response rate and the primary endpoint of TTP, docetaxel is superior to sequential methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil in advanced breast cancer after anthracycline failure.",1
Prognostic and predictive impact of central necrosis and fibrosis in early breast cancer: results from two International Breast Cancer Study Group randomized trials of chemoendocrine adjuvant therapy.,"A minority of early invasive breast cancers show a pattern of central necrosis and fibrosis (CNF). Previous studies have documented an adverse prognostic impact and association with other adverse pathological features, but its predictive importance for therapy selection is unknown. We examined the prognostic and predictive value of CNF in two randomized clinical trials comparing chemoendocrine therapy with endocrine therapy alone in patients with node-negative breast cancer. A total of 1,850 patients randomly assigned to treatment groups comparing endocrine with chemoendocrine therapy, and with centrally-assessed CNF, ER, PgR and HER2 were included in the analytic cohort. The median follow up was 10 years. CNF was present in 84 of 1,850 trial patients (4.5%). It was associated with tumor characteristics suggesting poor outcome, but was an independent adverse factor for disease-free survival. In the presence of CNF outcome was worse regardless of tumor grade, whereas in the absence of CNF, patients with grade 3 tumors had poorer outcome than those with grade 1-2 tumors. Among patients with estrogen receptor-absent tumors chemoendocrine therapy was superior to endocrine therapy alone only in the absence of CNF [HR (chemoendocrine:endocrine) = 0.46 in CNF-absent, 0.90 in CNF-present], while among those with receptor-positive disease chemoendocrine therapy was beneficial only in the presence of CNF [HR = 0.34 CNF-present, 0.96 CNF-absent]. The results suggest that the presence of CNF reflects a biological difference in early breast cancer that is important in modulating the efficacy of standard therapies. Accordingly we believe that its presence should be routinely reported.",0
"Chemotherapy versus tamoxifen versus chemotherapy plus tamoxifen in node-positive, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients: results of a multicentric Italian study. Breast Cancer Adjuvant Chemo-Hormone Therapy Cooperative Group.","Between November 1, 1983 and June 30, 1987, 510 node-positive, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer patients have been randomly allocated to receive either chemotherapy (six intravenous [IV] cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil [CMF] courses followed by four IV epirubicin courses) or 5 years of tamoxifen treatment or a combination of both therapies. After a median follow-up of 40 months, patients receiving the combined treatment achieved the best results, and those treated with chemotherapy alone achieved the worst, the difference being particularly evident in postmenopausal women. However, while the concurrent use of chemotherapy and tamoxifen did improve the results achieved by chemotherapy alone, particularly in postmenopausal women and in those with four or more involved nodes, it did not significantly improve the results achieved by tamoxifen alone, particularly in patients with higher ER tumor concentrations. Side effects were more numerous and more severe in patients receiving chemotherapy (with or without tamoxifen). Our findings, although still preliminary, confirm that tamoxifen should be the treatment of choice for postmenopausal breast cancer patients with node-positive, ER-positive tumors. In addition, the findings suggest that tamoxifen may represent a safe alternative to chemotherapy (at least to the cytotoxic regimen we used) for younger women, provided they have ER-positive tumors. In patients with ER-positive tumors, the addition of chemotherapy to tamoxifen does not seem to improve significantly the effectiveness of tamoxifen alone.",1

Letrozole in the extended adjuvant setting: MA.17.,"Relapse after completing adjuvant tamoxifen therapy is a persistent threat for women with hormone-responsive breast cancer. Third-generation aromatase inhibitors, such as letrozole, provide a new option for extended adjuvant hormonal therapy after 5 years of tamoxifen. MA.17 was conducted to determine whether letrozole improves outcome after discontinuation of tamoxifen. Postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (N=5,187) were randomized to letrozole 2.5 mg or placebo once daily for 5 years. At a median follow-up of 30 months, letrozole significantly improved disease-free survival (DFS; P<0.001), the primary end point, compared with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] for recurrence or contralateral breast cancer 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45, 0.76] P<0.001). Furthermore, letrozole significantly improved distant DFS (HR=0.60; 95% CI 0.43, 0.84; P=0.002) and, in women with node-positive tumors, overall survival (HR=0.61; 95% CI 0.38, 0.98; P=0.04). Clinical benefits, including an overall survival advantage, were also seen in women who crossed over from placebo to letrozole after unblinding, indicating that tumors remain sensitive to hormone therapy despite a prolonged period since discontinuation of tamoxifen. The efficacy and safety of letrozole therapy beyond 5 years is being assessed in a re-randomization study, following the emergence of new data suggesting that clinical benefit correlates with the duration of letrozole. MA.17 showed that letrozole is extremely well-tolerated relative to placebo. Letrozole should be considered for all women completing tamoxifen; new results from the post-unblinding analysis suggest that letrozole treatment should also be considered for all disease-free women for periods up to 5 years following completion of adjuvant tamoxifen.",1
A prospective evaluation of chemohormonal therapy remission maintenance in advanced breast cancer.,"From October 1973 to October 1977 the ECOG prospectively evaluated cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) versus CMF plus fluoxymesterone (CMFH) maintenance therapies in responders to 6 months of induction therapy which consisted of either CMF, CMF plus prednisone (CMFP), or adriamycin plus vincristine (AV). Following the maintenance randomization 12% of the patients converted from a PR to a CR status. The median time from randomization to treatment failure was 9.5 months for CMFH and 6.7 months for CMF (p = 0.03). This difference was observed only for partial responders (p = 0.01) and not for complete responders. Patients receiving CMFH tended to maintain higher hemoglobin, leukocyte, and platelet levels, and receive a higher dosage of each of the cytotoxic drugs. The results are taken as evidence that the addition of fluoxymesterone to a maintenance CMF regimen provides a therapeutic advantage. It is hypothesized that this effect is due at least in part to fluoxymesterone associated maintenance of improved marrow function resulting in greater myelosuppressive drug delivery.",1
Three new active cisplatin-containing combinations in the neoadjuvant treatment of locally advanced and locally recurrent breast carcinoma: a randomized phase II trial.,"We designed three new four-drug cisplatin-containing combinations and evaluated their activity in a randomized phase II study including patients with locally advanced (stage III) and locally recurrent breast carcinoma. All combinations included methotrexate (M) on day 1 and cisplatin (P) on day 2 (MVAC-like combinations) and differed from one another by the addition of Epirubicin (Epi), Vincristine (V), Etoposide (E), Mitomycin (Mi). Based on the administered agents, they were named MPEMi, MPEpiE, MPEpiV. The combinations were randomly assigned to 101 patients, 57 with locally advanced and 44 with locally recurrent breast carcinoma. Response was evaluated after 4 cycles. The complete response (CR) rates were 7% and 43% and the CR plus partial response (PR) rates were 84% and 89% in locally advanced and in locally recurrent disease, respectively. In locally advanced disease, a pathologic CR (pCR) was assessed in seven of 57 patients (12%). There were no significant differences among the three combinations. The toxicities were at times severe, but generally tolerable, as demonstrated by the high cumulative doses of the drugs received by the patients. In conclusion, these three innovative chemotherapy regimens induced high CR plus PR rates in the neoadjuvant treatment of stage III and of locally recurrent breast carcinoma, and a high rate of pCR in stage III disease. These regimens warrant testing in phase III trials.",1
"Lower-dose vs high-dose oral estradiol therapy of hormone receptor-positive, aromatase inhibitor-resistant advanced breast cancer: a phase 2 randomized study.","CONTEXT: Estrogen deprivation therapy with aromatase inhibitors has been hypothesized to paradoxically sensitize hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer tumor cells to low-dose estradiol therapy. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether 6 mg of estradiol (daily) is a viable therapy for postmenopausal women with advanced aromatase inhibitor-resistant hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A phase 2 randomized trial of 6 mg vs 30 mg of oral estradiol used daily (April 2004-February 2008 [enrollment closed]). Eligible patients (66 randomized) had metastatic breast cancer treated with an aromatase inhibitor with progression-free survival (> or = 24 wk) or relapse (after > or = 2 y) of adjuvant aromatase inhibitor use. Patients at high risk of estradiol-related adverse events were excluded. Patients were examined after 1 and 2 weeks for clinical and laboratory toxicities and flare reactions and thereafter every 4 weeks. Tumor radiological assessment occurred every 12 weeks. At least 1 measurable lesion or 4 measurable lesions (bone-only disease) were evaluated for tumor response. INTERVENTION: Randomization to receive 1 oral 2-mg generic estradiol tablet 3 times daily or five 2-mg tablets 3 times daily. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary end point: clinical benefit rate (response plus stable disease at 24 weeks). Secondary outcomes: toxicity, progression-free survival, time to treatment failure, quality of life, and the predictive properties of the metabolic flare reaction detected by positron emission tomography/computed tomography with fluorodeoxyglucose F 18. RESULTS: The adverse event rate (> or = grade 3) in the 30-mg group (11/32 [34%]; 95% confidence interval [CI], 23%-47%) was higher than in the 6-mg group (4/34 [18%]; 95% CI, 5%-22%; P = .03). Clinical benefit rates were 9 of 32 (28%; 95% CI, 18%-41%) in the 30-mg group and 10 of 34 (29%; 95% CI, 19%-42%) in the 6-mg group. An estradiol-stimulated increase in fluorodeoxyglucose F 18 uptake (> or = 12% prospectively defined) was predictive of response (positive predictive value, 80%; 95% CI, 61%-92%). Seven patients with estradiol-sensitive disease were re-treated with aromatase inhibitors at estradiol progression, among which 2 had partial response and 1 had stable disease, suggesting resensitization to estrogen deprivation. CONCLUSIONS: In women with advanced breast cancer and acquired resistance to aromatase inhibitors, a daily dose of 6 mg of estradiol provided a similar clinical benefit rate as 30 mg, with fewer serious adverse events. The efficacy of treatment with the lower dose should be further examined in phase 3 clinical trials. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00324259.",0
An evaluation of early or delayed adjuvant chemotherapy in premenopausal patients with advances breast cancer undergoing oophorectomy: a later analysis.,"In 1977 we reported our results of an ongoing randomized clinical trial evaluating early or delayed adjuvant chemotherapy utilizing 5-flourouracil, cytoxan and prednisone in premenopausal patients with recurrent or advanced breast cancer. At that time the group receiving early systemic chemotherapy was shown to have an improved progression-free interval and appeared to have a trend toward improved survival. The results of subsequent analysis after over 4 more years of follow-up indicate however, that while early employment of systemic chemotherapy does indeed prolong the progression-free interval, and while this advantage has been maintained, there is no survival advantage shown for either group of patients.",0
"Proliferative activity, histological grade and benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in node positive breast cancer.","The influence of S-phase fraction (SPF), measured by DNA flow cytometry, and histological grade on outcome following adjuvant chemotherapy was analysed for 214 patients with node positive breast cancer treated at Guy's Hospital who were entered into the Guy's/Manchester trial of combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/5-fluorouracil (CMF) vs. no adjuvant treatment. Adjuvant CMF significantly improved relapse-free survival (RFS) for premenopausal patients whose tumours had an SPF of 10% or less (control vs. CMF, P = 0.05) and premenopausal patients whose tumours had an SPF over 10% (control vs. CMF, P = 0.003). No significant improvement in RFS attributable to CMF was seen for either subgroup of postmenopausal patients. When patients were divided into subgroups based on histological grade of tumour, an improvement in RFS attributable to CMF was seen for premenopausal patients with well differentiated (grade 1 or 2) tumours (control vs. CMF, P = 0.03) and premenopausal patients with poorly differentiated (grade 3) tumours (control vs. CMF, P = 0.006). Again, no improvement in RFS was noted for any subgroup of postmenopausal patients defined by tumour grade.",0
Phase II trial of paclitaxel by 3-hour infusion as initial and salvage chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel administered by 3-hour infusion as initial and salvage chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-nine patients with metastatic breast cancer received paclitaxel via 3-hour intravenous infusion after standard premedication. Prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was not used, and chemotherapy was cycled every 3 weeks. For 25 patients who received paclitaxel as initial therapy (group I), the starting dose was 250 mg/m2. Twenty-four patients who had received two or more prior regimens, including an anthracycline (group II), started at 175 mg/m2. Paclitaxel pharmacokinetics were evaluated in 23 patients in group I. RESULTS: Grade 3 and 4 toxicities included (groups I/II) neutropenia (36%/33%), thrombocytopenia (0%/8%), anemia (0%/13%), neuropathy (8%/0%), arthralgia/myalgia (16%/4%), and mucositis (4%/4%). No significant hypersensitivity-type reactions or cardiac arrhythmias were seen. Six patients who received paclitaxel at > or = 250 mg/m2 experienced transient photopsia, without apparent chronic neuro-ophthalmologic sequelae. The mean peak plasma paclitaxel concentration was 5.87 mumol/L (range, 1.99 to 7.89) for these patients, and 6.08 mumol/L (range, 0.81 to 13.81) for 17 of 19 patients who did not experience visual symptoms. In 25 assessable patients in group I at a median follow-up time of 12 months, one complete response (CR) and seven partial responses (PRs) have been observed, for a total response rate of 32% (95% confidence interval [CI], 15% to 53%). In group II, five PRs were noted in 24 assessable patients (20.8%; 95% CI, 7% to 42%). Median response durations were 7 months for group I and 4 months for group II. CONCLUSION: Paclitaxel via 3-hour infusion, without prophylactic G-CSF, is active and safe as initial and subsequent therapy for metastatic breast cancer. The transient visual symptoms noted at higher doses seem unrelated to peak plasma paclitaxel concentration. Further studies that compare 3- and 24 hour (or other) infusion schedules are necessary to determine the optimal administration of paclitaxel in metastatic breast cancer.",1
Efficacy of zoledronic acid and pamidronate in breast cancer patients: a comparative analysis of randomized phase III trials.,"Results of a large, randomized, comparative phase III trial involving 1,130 breast cancer patients demonstrated that 4 mg zoledronic acid and 90 mg pamidronate were equally effective at reducing the occurrence and delaying the onset of skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastases secondary to breast cancer. However, zoledronic acid has demonstrated a treatment advantage over pamidronate with respect to the proportion of patients receiving radiation therapy to bone. Moreover, among patients with at least one osteolytic lesion (N = 352), zoledronic acid achieved a 17% reduction in the proportion of patients with a skeletal-related event compared with pamidronate and significantly prolonged the time to first event. In general, zoledronic acid and pamidronate had comparable effects on time to progression of bone metastases, overall disease progression, pain and analgesia scores, and overall survival. Both zoledronic acid and pamidronate effectively suppressed markers of bone resorption. However, zoledronic acid demonstrated a greater and more sustained suppressive effect. Zoledronic acid (4 mg via 15-minute infusion) also demonstrated a safety profile similar to that of pamidronate (90 mg via 2-hour infusion). In summary, the increased efficacy of zoledronic acid in specific patient subsets and the convenience of a 15-minute infusion suggest that 4 mg zoledronic acid has advantages over 90 mg pamidronate for treatment of bone metastases in patients with breast cancer.",0
In vivo chemosensitivity-adapted preoperative chemotherapy in patients with early-stage breast cancer: the GEPARTRIO pilot study.,"BACKGROUND: Response to the first two cycles of preoperative chemotherapy might differentiate subgroups of breast cancer patients with high or minimal chances for a pathologic complete response (pCR) and may be used as an in vivo chemosensitivity test. METHODS: Breast cancer patients were treated with two cycles of TAC (docetaxel 75 mg/m(2), doxorubicin 50 mg/m(2), cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2) every 21 days). Patients whose tumors showed a response received four more cycles. Patients whose tumors did not respond were randomized to four additional cycles TAC or NX (vinorelbine 25 mg/m(2) days 1 and 8, capecitabine 2000 mg/m(2) days 1-14, every 21 days). The primary end point was pCR at surgery. RESULTS: Two hundred and eighty-five patients showed a clinical response, in 73.0% after two cycles, in 88.4% at surgery, and a pCR was seen in 17.9%. Breast conservation was possible in 72.2%. Responding patients obtained a pCR in 22.6% whereas non-responding patients reached a pCR in 7.3% and 3.1% with TAC or NX, respectively. Grade III/IV neutropenia and febrile neutropenia were observed during TAC in 70.2% and 13.5%, respectively. Significantly less toxicity were observed with NX. CONCLUSION: Early response to TAC can reliably identify patients with a high chance of achieving a pCR. New effective treatments need to be explored for patients without an early response.",1
3-year results of docetaxel-based sequential and combination regimens in the adjuvant therapy of node-positive breast cancer: a pilot study.,"BACKGROUND: Docetaxel has proven efficacy in metastatic breast cancer. In this pilot study, we explored the efficacy/feasibility of docetaxel-based sequential and combination regimens as adjuvant therapy of node-positive breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From March 1996 till March 1998, four consecutive groups of patients with stages II and III breast cancer, aged < or = 70 years, received one of the following regimens: a) sequential Doxorubicin (A) --> Docetaxel (T) --> CMF (Cyclophosphamide+Methotrexate+5-Fluorouracil): A 75 mg/m q 3 wks x 3, followed by T100 mg/m2 q 3 wks x 3, followed by i.v. CMF Days 1+8 q 4 wks x 3; b) sequential accelerated A --> T --> CMF: A and T administered at the same doses q 2 wks with Lenograstin support; c) combination therapy: A 50 mg/m2 + T 75 mg/m2 q 3 wks x 4, followed by CMF x 4; d) sequential T --> A --> CMF: T and A, administered as in group a), with the reverse sequence. When indicated, radiotherapy was administered during or after CMF, and Tamoxifen after CMF. RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were treated. The median age was 48 years (29-66) and the median number of positive axillary nodes was 6 (1-25). Tumors were operable in 94% and locally advanced in 6% of cases. Pathological tumor size was >2 cm in 72% of cases. There were 21 relapses, (18 systemic, 3 locoregional) and 11 patients (12%) have died from disease progression. At median follow-up of 39 months (6-57), overall survival (OS) was 87% (95% CI, 79-94%) and disease-free survival (DFS) was 76% (95% CI, 67%-85%). CONCLUSION: The efficacy of these docetaxel-based regimens, in terms of OS and DFS, appears to be at least as good as standard anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy (CT), in similar high-risk patient populations.",1
Treatment of depressive symptoms in patients with early stage breast cancer undergoing adjuvant therapy.,"BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that there is a high prevalence of depression in cancer patients. Women with breast cancer may have an even higher risk of depression particularly in a postmenopausal or estrogen deficiency state. A small number of randomized controlled trials have examined the efficacy of antidepressants compared to that of a placebo in cancer patients, but some results have been difficult to interpret due to a heterogeneous patient group. In the current investigation, we screened newly diagnosed early stage breast cancer patients for depressive symptoms prior to the initiation of adjuvant therapy and investigated whether the oral antidepressant fluoxetine affected depressive symptoms, completion of adjuvant treatment, and quality of life. METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed early stage breast cancer were screened for depressive symptoms prior to the initiation of adjuvant therapy. Patients with depressive symptoms were randomized to a daily oral fluoxetine or a placebo. Patients were then followed for 6 months and evaluated for quality of life, completion of adjuvant treatment, and depressive symptoms. RESULTS: A high percentage of patients with newly diagnosed early stage breast cancer were found to have depressive symptoms prior to the initiation of adjuvant therapy. The use of fluoxetine for 6 months resulted in an improvement in quality of life, a higher completion of adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, chemotherapy plus hormonal therapy), and a reduction in depressive symptoms compared to patients who received placebo. CONCLUSIONS: An antidepressant should be considered for early stage breast cancer patients with depressive symptoms who are receiving adjuvant treatment.",0
The sequencing of chemotherapy and radiation therapy after conservative surgery for early-stage breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with early-stage breast cancer who are at substantial risk for systemic metastases are increasingly treated with breast-conserving therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy. However, the optimal sequencing of chemotherapy and radiation therapy is not clear. METHODS: Two hundred forty-four patients with stage I or II breast cancer who were at substantial risk for distant metastases were randomly assigned to receive a 12-week course of chemotherapy either before or after radiation therapy. All had had breast-conserving surgery. The median length of follow-up in surviving patients was 58 months (range, 10 to 124). RESULTS: The five-year actuarial rates of cancer recurrence at any site and of distant metastases in the radiotherapy-first group and the chemotherapy-first group were 38 percent and 31 percent (P = 0.17) and 36 percent and 25 percent (P = 0.05), respectively. Overall survival was 73 percent and 81 percent (P = 0.11), respectively. The five-year crude rates of first recurrence according to site in the radiotherapy-first and chemotherapy-first groups, respectively, were 5 percent and 14 percent for local recurrence and 32 percent and 20 percent for distant or regional recurrence or both. This difference in the pattern of recurrence was of borderline statistical significance (P = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that for patients ar substantial risk for systemic metastases, it is preferable to give a 12-week course of chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy, rather than radiation therapy followed by chemotherapy.",1
Adjuvant therapy with escalating doses of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide with or without leukocyte alpha-interferon for stage II or III breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: A prospective study in breast cancer patients was undertaken to determine whether escalating doses of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide would result in a higher fraction of patients free of disease, and to evaluate the role of leukocyte alpha-interferon. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1982 and 1986, 319 consecutive patients with stage II or III breast cancer with one or more positive nodes were assigned randomly to receive adjuvant chemotherapy that consisted of escalating doses of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide in combination with vincristine and prednisone or the same chemotherapy regimen followed by 1 year of leukocyte alpha-interferon. Doxorubicin was administered by 72-hour continuous infusion through a central venous catheter (maximum total cumulative dose, 430 mg/m2). All patients with positive or unknown estrogen receptor status were also given tamoxifen for 1 year. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 71 months (range, 35 to 99 months). Correlation of disease-free survival (DFS) with dose-intensity of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin showed no improvement in DFS for patients who were able to receive escalated drug doses compared with those who were not. Doxorubicin administered by continuous infusion was associated with a negligible risk of cardiotoxicity in this study despite the administration of higher accumulative doses than in our previous adjuvant therapy studies. The DFS rates of patients who did and those who did not receive leukocyte alpha-interferon were similar. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, there was no real evidence that higher drug dose intensity was associated with longer DFS. Leukocyte alpha-interferon as it was used in this study had no therapeutic value. Doxorubicin administered by infusion was associated with a reduced risk of cardiotoxicity.",1
"Mitoxantrone, 5-fluorouracil, and high dose leucovorin (NFL) versus intravenous cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) in first-line chemotherapy for patients with metastatic breast carcinoma: a randomized phase II trial.","BACKGROUND: Previous Phase II studies using the combination of mitoxantrone, 5-fluorouracil, and high dose leucovorin (NFL) in the treatment of metastatic breast carcinoma have shown this regimen to be active and well tolerated. In this randomized Phase II study, the authors compared the NFL regimen with a standard CMF regimen in the first-line therapy of patients with metastatic breast carcinoma. METHODS: One hundred twenty-eight women receiving their first chemotherapy for metastatic breast carcinoma were entered into this randomized study. Sixty-four patients were treated with NFL: mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2 IV on Day 1; leucovorin 300 mg IV over 30-60 minutes on Days 1, 2, and 3, immediately preceding administration of 5-fluorouracil; and 5-fluorouracil 350 mg/m2 IV bolus on Days 1, 2, and 3. Sixty-four patients received CMF: cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 IV on Day 1; methotrexate 40 mg/m2 IV on Day 1; and 5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m2 IV on Day 1. Both regimens were repeated at 21-day intervals; responding patients received at least 8 courses. RESULTS: Patients treated with NFL had a higher response rate than patients treated with the CMF regimen (45% vs. 26%, respectively; P = 0.021). Median duration of response was 9 months with NFL and 6 months with CMF (P = 0.10); 11 patients had long responses (>12 months) with NFL versus 4 patients with CMF (P = 0.06). Median survival was similar for both groups. Both regimens were well tolerated, with infrequent Grade 3 or 4 toxicities. CONCLUSIONS: NFL is an active, well-tolerated regimen for the treatment of metastatic breast carcinoma; it produced a higher response rate than the CMF regimen used in this study. Although more intense CMF regimens or regimens containing doxorubicin would likely increase the response rate, they would almost certainly do so with the consequence of greater toxicity as compared with NFL. NFL is an excellent initial palliative treatment option for elderly patients or patients who have exhibited poor tolerance for other chemotherapy regimens.",1
"Randomised, phase II trial comparing oral capecitabine (Xeloda) with paclitaxel in patients with metastatic/advanced breast cancer pretreated with anthracyclines.","Capecitabine, an oral fluoropyrimidine carbamate, was designed to generate 5-fluorouracil preferentially at the tumour site. This randomised, phase II trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of capecitabine or paclitaxel in patients with anthracycline-pretreated metastatic breast cancer. Outpatients with locally advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer whose disease was unresponsive or resistant to anthracycline therapy were randomised to 3-week cycles of intermittent oral capecitabine (1255 mg m(-2) twice daily, days 1-14, (22 patients)) or a reference arm of i.v. paclitaxel (175 mg m(-2), (20 patients)). Two additional patients were initially randomised to continuous capecitabine 666 mg m(-2) twice daily, but this arm was closed following selection of the intermittent schedule for further development. Overall response rate was 36% (95% CI 17-59%) with capecitabine (including three complete responses) and 26% (95% CI 9-51%) with paclitaxel (no complete responses). Median time to disease progression was similar in the two treatment groups (3.0 months with capecitabine, 3.1 months with paclitaxel), as was overall survival (7.6 and 9.4 months, respectively). Paclitaxel was associated with more alopecia, peripheral neuropathy, myalgia and neutropenia, whereas typical capecitabine-related adverse events were diarrhoea, vomiting and hand-foot syndrome. Twenty-three per cent of capecitabine-treated patients and 16% of paclitaxel-treated patients achieved a > or =10% improvement in Karnofsky Performance Status. Oral capecitabine is active in anthracycline-pretreated advanced/metastatic breast cancer and has a favourable safety profile. Furthermore, capecitabine provides a convenient, patient-orientated therapy.",1
"A randomized trial of once vs twice daily administration of intravenous granisetron with dexamethosone in patients receiving high-dose cyclophosphamide, thiotepa and carboplatin.","The purpose of this study was to determine the optimal schedule of i.v. granisetron and dexamethosone for control of nausea and emesis in patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy (HDC). Seventy patients with breast cancer received high-dose cyclophosphamide, thiotepa and carboplatin (CTCb) for 3 consecutive days. All 70 received dexamethasone 12 mg i.v. and granisetron 1 mg i.v. prior to infusion of CTCb and were randomized to receive placebo (n = 37) or an additional identical dose of granisetron (n = 33) 12 h later. Beginning on day 2 of chemotherapy administration, 55 patients evaluable later self-administered a cocktail of diphenhydramine (benadryl), lorazepam (ativan) and dexamethasone (BAD). Fourteen of 37 patients (38%) receiving granisetron once a day and 15/33 (44%) receiving it twice a day had a complete response during the first 24 h following the first doses of chemotherapy (P = 0.52). In the 55 evaluable patients receiving BAD, 18 of 29 (62%) in the once daily group and 14/26 (54%) in the twice daily group required additional medications (P = 0.54). The median time to first emetic episode was 20 h (range 6.6-79.5) for patients receiving once a day and 21.4 hours (range 5.8-105.3) for patients receiving twice a day granisetron (P = 0.48). Five patients in the once daily and seven patients in the twice daily group had complete control of nausea and emesis throughout the study period (P = 0.37). It was concluded that there were no statistically significant differences in nausea and emetic control between dexamethasone with once daily or twice daily i.v. granisetron administration in patients receiving high-dose CTCb.",0
Evaluation of the immunomodulatory activity of Aronia in combination with apple pectin in patients with breast cancer undergoing postoperative radiation therapy.,"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the immunomodulatory activity of Aronia in combination with apple pectin in patients with breast cancer in the course of postoperative radiation therapy. Monoclonal antibodies were used to assay specific T cell subsets. Tests were performed prior to and after 26 and 50 Gy of irradiation. The study comprised 42 women (19 to 65 years of age) receiving 15 g of apple pectin in combination with 20 ml of Aronia concentrate (Bioactive Substance Laboratory--Plovdiv) twice daily during postoperative irradiation. Irradiation was performed by a 60Co-Rokus according to individualized treatment schedules. The following T lymphocyte populations were tested--CD3 total T lymphocytes, CD4 helper and inducer T cells, CD8 suppressor and cytotoxic T cells and NK cells. The levels of the polypeptide tissue antigen (TPA), an oncofetal protein, were tested in parallel. The TPA was used to assess treatment outcome in our patients. A group of 25 age-matched women with breast cancer served as controls. Immune status analysis of controls was performed prior to and following postoperative radiation. A total of 880 serum samples were tested. Assays of immunity parameters in the patients receiving Aronia in combination with apple pectin showed that CD4 and CD8 T cell counts increased significantly (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05 respectively). In control patients CD3 T cell levels lowered, the other T cell levels remained unchanged. Initially the number of NK cells was increased in both groups of patients. It remained constant throughout the course of the study. The normal levels of TPA in both groups of patients indicated a good treatment outcome due to the adequacy of surgery and in combination with radiation therapy.",0
Lapatinib plus letrozole as first-line therapy for HER-2+ hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of letrozole plus lapatinib versus letrozole plus placebo in women with hormone receptor (HR)(+) human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2(+) tumors receiving first-line therapy for metastatic breast cancer (MBC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Postmenopausal women (n = 1,286) with HR(+) MBC were randomized to daily oral treatment with letrozole (2.5 mg) plus lapatinib (1,500 mg) versus letrozole (2.5 mg) plus placebo. Of the 1,286 patients enrolled in the phase III study, 219 had HER-2(+) tumors. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in HER-2(+) patients. RESULTS: Results in the HR(+) HER-2(+) population (n = 219) are presented. The addition of lapatinib to letrozole resulted in a significantly lower risk for disease progression than with letrozole alone (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.53-0.96). The PFS time was 8.2 months, versus 3.0 months. The objective response rate (ORR) (28% versus 15%) and clinical benefit rate (CBR) (48% versus 29%) were also significantly greater in lapatinib-treated women. The most common adverse events in the lapatinib group were diarrhea (68%) and rash (46%), primarily grade 1 and 2. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of lapatinib to letrozole is well tolerated and leads to a significantly greater PFS time, ORR, and CBR than with letrozole alone in women with MBC who coexpress HR and HER-2.",1

Reserpine and breast cancer in the Hypertension Detection and Follow-Up Program.,"Recent reports on the efficacy of pharmacological management in reducing mortality associated with mild hypertension have enhanced the importance of increasing our knowledge about drug toxicity. The Hypertension Detection and Follow-Up Program (HDFP) provides a convenient setting in which to examine the association reported between reserpine usage and breast cancer. In the intensively treated and followed group (Stepped Care [SC]), the relative breast cancer experience of those who did take reserpine and those who did not was examined. Of 2529 females in SC, 1036 received reserpine, with an average exposure of 1.97 years during 5 years of follow-up. Through extensive investigation, 21 cases of breast cancer were identified. using a life table regression method of analysis to adjust for actual time of reserpine exposure, race, sex, and medication status at entry, and comparing those who took reserpine with those who did not, the author's calculated a risk ratio of 1.28, with a confidence interval of 0.58 to 2.80. Adjustment for a number of other variables known to have relationships to breast cancer did not appreciably change the results. Thus, with certain precautions, the authors conclude that in this setting there is no indication of the recently postulated association of reserpine and the short-term enhancement of breast tumor growth.",0
Bisphosphonate treatment in primary breast cancer: results from a randomised comparison of oral pamidronate versus no pamidronate in patients with primary breast cancer.,"PURPOSE AND PATIENTS: During the period from January 1990 to January 1996 a total of 953 patients with lymph node negative primary breast cancer were randomised to oral pamidronate (n=460) 150 mg twice daily for 4 years or no adjuvant pamidronate (n=493) in order to investigate whether oral pamidronate can prevent the occurrence of bone metastases and fractures. The patients received adjuvant chemotherapy, loco-regional radiation therapy, but no endocrine treatment. RESULTS: During the follow-up period the number of patients with pure bone metastases was 35 in the control group and 31 in the pamidronate group. The number of patients with a combination of bone and other distant metastases were 22 in the control group and 20 in the pamidronate group. The hazard rate ratio for recurrence in bone in the pamidronate group compared to the control group was 1.03 (95% confidence interval 0.75-1.40) and p=0.86. No effect was observed on overall survival. In a small subgroup of 27 patients from the study, 12 of whom were treated with pamidronate a significant bone preserving effect was observed on bone mineral density in the lumbar spine, but not in the proximal femur. CONCLUSION: The results from the trial do not support a beneficial effect of oral pamidronate on the occurrence of bone metastases or fractures in patients with primary breast cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapy.",0
Benefit of a high-dose epirubicin regimen in adjuvant chemotherapy for node-positive breast cancer patients with poor prognostic factors: 5-year follow-up results of French Adjuvant Study Group 05 randomized trial.,"PURPOSE: To determine the influence of the epirubicin dose in operable node-positive breast cancer patients with factors of poor prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between April 1990 and July 1993, 565 operable breast cancer patients with either more than three positive nodes or between one and three positive nodes with Scarff Bloom Richardson grade > or = 2 and hormone receptor negativity were randomized after surgery to receive either fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 50 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2) every 21 days for six cycles (FEC 50) or the same regimen except with epirubicin dose of 100 mg/m(2) (FEC 100). Postmenopausal patients received tamoxifen 30 mg/d for 3 years at the beginning of chemotherapy. Radiotherapy was delivered at the end of chemotherapy in both groups. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 67 months. The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 54.8% with FEC 50 and 66.3% with FEC 100 (P =.03). The 5-year overall survival (OS) was 65.3% and 77.4%, respectively (P =.007). The mean relative dose-intensity was similar in the two groups (90.3% and 86.1%, respectively). Neutropenia and anemia were significantly more frequent in FEC 100 (P < 10(-3)), as were nausea-vomiting (P =.008) and stomatitis and alopecia (P < 10(-3)). Nine cases of grade 3 infection occurred only with FEC 100, and no toxic deaths occurred. Three cases of acute cardiac toxicity were observed (FEC50 = 1, FEC100 = 2) and 10 patients (FEC50 = 6, FEC100 = 4) presented delayed cardiac dysfunctions. Two cases of secondary leukemia were observed (acute lymphatic leukemia with FEC 50 and acute myelogenous leukemia with FEC 100). CONCLUSION: After 5 years of follow-up, the increased epirubicin dose led to a significant benefit in terms of DFS and OS, with a high survival rate among patients with poor-prognosis breast cancer.",1
Docetaxel versus doxorubicin in patients with metastatic breast cancer who have failed alkylating chemotherapy: a preliminary report of the randomized phase III trial. 303 Study Group.,"Three hundred twenty-six patients who had failed prior alkylating agents, given either as adjuvant therapy or therapy for advanced breast cancer or both, were randomly assigned to treatment with up to seven cycles of doxorubicin 75 mg/m2 or docetaxel (Taxotere, Rhône-Poulenc Rorer, Antony, France) 100 mg/m2 given every 3 weeks. The two arms of the study were well-matched for age, performance status, previous therapy, and the nature of the metastatic disease. Forty-seven percent of the docetaxel-treated patients and 49% of the doxorubicin-treated patients were defined as having disease that showed primary or secondary resistance. Overall, 48% of patients treated with docetaxel had an objective response. This was significantly greater than the 33% response rate seen in doxorubicin-treated patients (P = .008). Among those patients classified as having resistant disease, the difference was equally clear cut (response rate, 47% v 25%; P = .003). Overall median time to response was 12 weeks with docetaxel and 23 weeks with doxorubicin. Febrile neutropenia, grade 3/4 nausea and vomiting, and cardiotoxicity were significantly more common among the doxorubicin-treated patients, while diarrhea grade 3-4, skin toxicity, neurologic toxicity, fluid retention, and allergy of any grade were significantly more likely in the docetaxel-treated patients. This study demonstrates for the first time the superiority in terms of response rate of a taxoid over an anthracycline in the treatment of advanced breast cancer.",1
"Improved survival, quality of life, and quality-adjusted survival in breast cancer patients treated with efaproxiral (Efaproxyn) plus whole-brain radiation therapy for brain metastases.","OBJECTIVE: To determine whether efaproxiral, an allosteric modifier of hemoglobin, improves quality of life and quality of survival in patients with primary breast cancer and brain metastases when used as an adjunct to whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT). METHODS: Patients with brain metastases from breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive WBRT and either efaproxiral or no efaproxiral. The primary endpoint for this analysis was quality of life and quality-adjusted survival. Quality of life was assessed prior to initiation of WBRT and periodically in follow-up using the Spitzer Quality of Life Index (SQLI). RESULTS: A subgroup of 106 eligible breast cancer patients with baseline SQLI were randomized into this study and represent the target population discussed in this report. Treatment, age, and SQLI were significant predictors of survival. The addition of efaproxiral to WBRT reduced the death rate by 46% (P = 0.0086). Quality of life was improved in the WBRT + efaproxiral arm compared with the WBRT alone arm (P = 0.019). Quality-adjusted survival was statistically significantly improved by the addition of efaproxiral to WBRT (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Survival, quality of life, and quality-adjusted survival were all improved in breast cancer patients with brain metastases receiving efaproxiral and WBRT compared with those receiving WBRT alone.",0
"Effects of epoetin alfa on cognitive function, mood, asthenia, and quality of life in women with breast cancer undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy.","Several recently published studies describe moderate to severe cognitive dysfunction in breast cancer survivors who were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy 1-5 years before undergoing extensive neuropsychological testing. While these studies are hypothesis-generating and preliminary given their small size and retrospective nature, they consistently suggest that between approximately 15% and 25% of chemotherapy-treated breast cancer patients will have evidence of cognitive dysfunction some years after chemotherapy, compared to about 10% of breast cancer survivors who did not receive chemotherapy. Recent preclinical data strongly suggest that erythropoetin is a potent, endogenous neuroprotective agent that prevents neuronal apoptosis from a variety of insults including hypoxia, trauma, subarachnoidal hemorrhage, and encephalitis. Erythropoietin also appears to enhance learning in a mouse spatial learning maze model. We have conducted a pilot study of epoetin alfa versus placebo in early-stage breast cancer patients who received standard adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy to determine the feasibility of administering standardized neurocognitive assessment tests in the oncology practice setting in order to understand whether the Executive Interview 25 test can detect the subtle cognitive impairment in verbal fluency, attention, and short-term memory observed with chemotherapy, and to assess whether epoetin alfa-treated patients have less evidence of cognitive dysfunction during and 6 months after chemotherapy compared with control-treated patients. We report here the preliminary results of this pilot clinical trial.",0
Comparable efficacy and safety profiles of once-per-cycle pegfilgrastim and daily injection filgrastim in chemotherapy-induced neutropenia: a multicenter dose-finding study in women with breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Neutropenia is common in patients receiving myelotoxic chemotherapy. Pegfilgrastim, a sustained-duration filgrastim is a once-per-cycle therapy for prophylactic neutrophil support. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women, treated with four cycles of doxorubicin/docetaxel chemotherapy every 21 days, received pegfilgrastim or filgrastim 24 h after chemotherapy as a single subcutaneous injection per chemotherapy cycle (pegfilgrastim 30, 60 or 100 microg/kg) or daily subcutaneous injections (filgrastim 5 microg/kg/day). Safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics were analyzed. RESULTS: The incidence of grade 4 neutropenia in cycle 1 was 95, 90 and 74%, in patients who received pegfilgrastim 30, 60 and 100 microg/kg, respectively, and 76% in patients who received filgrastim. Mean duration of grade 4 neutropenia in cycle 1 was 2.7,2 and 1.3 days for doses of pegfilgrastim, and 1.6 days for filgrastim. The pharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim were non-linear and dependent on both dose and neutrophil count. Pegfilgrastim serum concentration was sustained until the neutrophil nadir occurred then declined rapidly as neutrophils started to recover, consistent with a self-regulating neutrophil-mediated clearance mechanism. The safety profiles of pegfilgrastim and filgrastim were similar. CONCLUSIONS: A single subcutaneous injection of pegfilgrastim 100 microg/kg provided neutrophil support and a safety profile comparable to daily subcutaneous injections of filgrastim during multiple chemotherapy cycles.",0
NSABP B-42: a clinical trial to determine the efficacy of five years of letrozole compared with placebo in patients completing five years of hormonal therapy consisting of an aromatase inhibitor (AI) or tamoxifen followed by an AI in prolonging disease-free survival in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.,,1
"The effects of neoadjuvant anastrozole (Arimidex) on tumor volume in postmenopausal women with breast cancer: a randomized, double-blind, single-center study.","Anastrozole, an orally active, nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor, was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, single-center study to determine its efficacy as neoadjuvant therapy in postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed, estrogen receptor-rich, locally advanced or large (>3 cm), operable breast cancers. Twenty-four eligible patients were recruited into the study and received either 1 mg (n = 12) or 10 mg (n = 12) of anastrozole daily over a 3-month period. Tumor volumes were estimated clinically, by using caliper measurements and ultrasound (at baseline and after 1, 2, and 3 months' treatment) and by mammography (at baseline and after 3 months). Tumor volume was also measured in surgical specimens. Twenty-one patients were classified as T2, two patients as T3, and one patient as T4B at baseline. Three patients had clinical evidence of lymph node involvement. When considering the difference between the volume as measured by each assessment and the actual pathological volume, the interquartile range and the difference between the maximum and minimum values were smaller for ultrasound when compared with those measured with calipers and mammography. Therefore, of the three clinical assessments of tumor volume used in this study, the data suggest that ultrasound may be the most accurate. The median reductions in tumor volumes as measured by ultrasound for those patients with a measurable 12-week assessment were 80.5 and 69.6% for anastrozole (1 and 10 mg, respectively) after 12 weeks of treatment and 75.5% when both doses were grouped together. Moreover, of these patients, 11 of 12 given 1 mg and 7 of 11 given 10 mg of anastrozole were found on ultrasound to have a >50% reduction in tumor volume after 12 weeks of treatment. Of the 17 patients who would have required a mastectomy at initiation of treatment, 15 were suitable for breast conservation after anastrozole treatment. These results suggest that anastrozole is highly effective as neoadjuvant therapy in postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-rich, large, operable breast cancer. Future studies comparing anastrozole with tamoxifen as a neoadjuvant treatment should be considered.",1
Weekly docetaxel in metastatic breast cancer patients: no superior benefits compared to three-weekly docetaxel.,"BACKGROUND: In anthracycline-pretreated metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients, it is unknown whether weekly single-agent docetaxel is preferable to 3-weekly docetaxel regarding its toxicity and efficacy profile. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this multicenter, randomised, open-label phase III trial, 162 patients were randomised to weekly docetaxel (group A) or 3-weekly docetaxel (group B). The primary end-point was tolerability; secondary end-points were efficacy and quality of life (QoL). RESULTS: Group A (weekly docetaxel, n=79) experienced less haematological toxicity, with just 1.3% versus 16.9% febrile neutropenia in group B (3-weekly docetaxel, n=77) (p=0.001). Not this difference, but fatigue and general malaise foremost led to more patient withdrawals in group A (24 versus 12 patients, p=0.032), less patients completing treatment (29 versus 43 patients, p=0.014) and reduced dose-intensity (15.6 versus 26mg/m(2)/week, 58% versus 70% of projected dose, p=0.017). As a result, 3-weekly docetaxel was related to better overall survival in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 0.70, p=0.036), although in univariate analysis efficacy was similar in both groups. Reported QoL was similar in both groups, but less effective treatment with more general toxicity led to less completed QoL forms in group A (65.4% versus 50%, p=0.049). CONCLUSION: Weekly docetaxel is less well tolerated than a 3-weekly schedule, due to more non-haematological toxicity, despite less febrile neutropenia. Also, no efficacy benefits can be demonstrated for weekly docetaxel, which may even be inferior based on multivariate analysis. Therefore, a 3-weekly schedule should be preferred in the setting of MBC.",1
Serial serum c-erbB-2 levels in patients with breast carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: Recently, the extracellular domain of the c-erbB-2 oncogene product (HER-2/neu) has been reported to be elevated in the serum of one-fourth of patients with metastatic breast carcinoma. The role of serum c-erbB-2 as a tumor marker, however, is still poorly defined. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of serial serum c-erbB-2 levels as a tumor marker in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma. METHODS: c-erbB-2 levels in the sera of patients with breast carcinoma were determined by an enzyme immunoassay that detects the extracellular domain of c-erbB-2. Serum c-erbB-2 levels were evaluated prior to treatment as well as throughout the course of treatment with second-line hormonal therapy employing either megestrol acetate or fadrozole, an experimental aromatase inhibitor. RESULTS: Fifty-eight of 300 patients (19.3%) had elevated pretreatment serum c-erbB-2 levels. Of these 58 patients with elevated pretreatment c-erbB-2, 48 had more than 1 visit which enabled us to quantitate serial c-erbB-2 levels throughout the course of treatment. Of these 48 patients, 28 (58.3%) had serial c-erbB-2 values that correlated with the clinical course. CONCLUSIONS: Serial serum c-erbB-2 levels did not show a high overall correlation with the clinical course in this group of patients with metastatic breast carcinoma treated with second-line hormonal therapy.",0
Analyses adjusting for selective crossover show improved overall survival with adjuvant letrozole compared with tamoxifen in the BIG 1-98 study.,"PURPOSE: Among postmenopausal women with endocrine-responsive breast cancer, the aromatase inhibitor letrozole, when compared with tamoxifen, has been shown to significantly improve disease-free survival (DFS) and time to distant recurrence (TDR). We investigated whether letrozole monotherapy prolonged overall survival (OS) compared with tamoxifen monotherapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 8,010 postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, early breast cancer enrolled on the Breast International Group (BIG) 1-98 study, 4,922 were randomly assigned to 5 years of continuous adjuvant therapy with either letrozole or tamoxifen. Of 2,459 patients enrolled in the tamoxifen treatment arm, 619 (25.2%) selectively crossed over to either adjuvant or extended letrozole after initial trial results were presented in January 2005. To gain better estimates of relative treatment effects in the presence of selective crossover, we used inverse probability of censoring weighted (IPCW) modeling.RESULTS: Weighted Cox models, by using IPCW, estimated a statistically significant, 18% reduction in the hazard of an OS event with letrozole treatment (hazard ratio [HR], 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.95). Estimates of 5-year OS on the basis of IPCW were 91.8% and 90.4% for letrozole and tamoxifen, respectively. The HRs of DFS and TDR events by using IPCW modeling were 0.83 (95% CI, 0.74 to 0.94) and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.67 to 0.94), respectively (P < .05 for DFS, OS, and TDR). Median follow-up was 74 months.CONCLUSION: Adjuvant treatment with letrozole, compared with tamoxifen, significantly reduces the risk of death, the risk of recurrent disease, and the risk of recurrence at distant sites in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.",0
A cosmetic evaluation of breast cancer treatment: a randomized study of radiotherapy boost technique.,"PURPOSE: To compare cosmetic results of two different radiotherapy (RT) boost techniques used in the treatment of breast cancer after whole breast radiotherapy and to identify factors affecting cosmetic outcomes. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1996 and 1998, 142 patients with Stage I and II breast cancer were treated with breast conservative surgery and adjuvant RT. Patients were then randomly assigned to receive a boost dose of 15 Gy delivered to the tumor bed either by iridium 192, or a combination of photons and electrons. Cosmetic evaluations were done on a 6-month basis, with a final evaluation at 36 months after RT. The evaluations were done using a panel of global and specific subjective scores, a digitized scoring system using the breast retraction assessment (BRA) measurement, and a patient's self-assessment evaluation. As cosmetic results were graded according to severity, the comparison of boost techniques was done using the ordinal logistic regression model. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) are presented. RESULTS: At 36 months of follow-up, there was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to the global subjective cosmetic outcome (OR = 1.40; 95%CI = 0.69-2.85, p = 0.35). Good to excellent scores were observed in 65% of implant patients and 62% of photon/electron patients. At 24 months and beyond, telangiectasia was more severe in the implant group with an OR of 9.64 (95%CI = 4.05-22.92, p < 0.0001) at 36 months. The only variable associated with a worse global cosmetic outcome was the presence of concomitant chemotherapy (OR = 3.87; 95%CI = 1.74-8.62). The BRA value once adjusted for age, concomitant chemotherapy, and boost volume showed a positive association with the boost technique. The BRA value was significantly greater in the implant group (p = 0.03). There was no difference in the patient's final self-assessment score between the two groups. Three variables were statistically associated with an adverse self-evaluation: an inferior quadrant tumor localization, postoperative hematoma, and concomitant chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Although this trial showed that at 36 months of follow-up, there were no significant differences in the overall global cosmetic scores between the implant boost group and the photon/electron boost group, telangiectasia was more severe and the BRA value was greater in the implant group.",0
"Double-blinded, placebo-controlled, prospective randomized trial evaluating the efficacy of paravertebral block with and without continuous paravertebral block analgesia in outpatient breast cancer surgery.","BACKGROUND: Paravertebral block (PVB) is an effective alternative to general anesthesia for breast cancer surgery. Continuous paravertebral block (CPVB) anesthesia may extend postoperative analgesia at home and improve quality of early postoperative recovery of breast cancer patients. PURPOSE: This double-blinded randomized trial was conducted to compare degree of pain, nausea, mood, level of symptom distress, and time to return to normal daily activity between PVB and PVB + CPVB in patients undergoing outpatient breast cancer surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between July 2003 and April 2008 we randomly assigned 94 (73 evaluable) patients in a 1:1:1 ratio with early breast cancer to single injection PVB followed by CPVB infusion of 0.1% or 0.2% ropivacaine vs placebo (saline) for 48 hours postoperatively for unilateral breast cancer surgery without reconstruction. The primary study endpoint was the degree of pain, nausea, mood state, level of symptom distress, and recovery time. RESULTS: Of the 468 patients assessed for eligibility, 94 consented and 21 with incomplete data or follow-up were excluded, leaving 73 subjects for analysis. There was no clinically significant difference in degree of postoperative pain, nausea, mood state, level of symptom distress, or return to normal activity among the three study groups. CONCLUSION: The current study does not support the routine use of continuous paravertebral catheter anesthesia in patients undergoing operative treatment for breast cancer.",0
"Retrolective, comparative, epidemiological cohort study with parallel groups design for evaluation of efficacy and safety of drugs with ""well-established use"".","UNLABELLED: The randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) is accepted as the ""golden standard"" for the evaluation of efficacy and safety of new drugs. In contrast, to demonstrate efficacy and safety of drugs with ""well-established use"" that have been on the European Community market for long time, observational comparative epidemiological studies can be used according to the European drug regulation directive. However, because comparative epidemiological cohort studies can share some risk of bias with other nonrandomized observational study designs, there is a need for an approach that could effectively reduce the bias risk in this type of studies. STUDY OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of a long-term complementary therapy of primary, non-metastatic breast carcinoma patients treated with standardized European mistletoe extract Iscador(""mistletoe"") in addition to the conventional adjuvant oncologic therapy, and compared to the control group treated with the conventional therapy alone. METHODS: The multicenter, comparative, retrolective, pharmaco-epidemiological cohort study with parallel groups design and randomly selected centers that routinely used both treatments was carried out according to Good Epidemiological Practice rules under a standard operating procedure control. The test group patients received the mistletoe extract treatment subcutaneously for at least 3 months, while the control group patients of the same cohort was exclusively treated with the conventional therapy. The patients were followed up for at least 3 years or until death. The primary endpoint of efficacy was the incidence of adverse reactions to the conventional oncologic therapy. Secondary endpoints were change from baseline of the symptoms associated with the disease and treatment as well as overall survival. All endpoints were adjusted to baseline imbalance and confounders. Safety was assessed descriptively by the number of patients with adverse drug reactions (ADRs) attributed to the test treatment. RESULTS: 1442 patients (710 tests and 732 controls) were eligible for the ""per protocol"" analysis of efficacy and safety. At baseline, the test group had a more advanced disease and worse prognostic factors profile. After a median follow-up of 66 vs. 60 months, and a median mistletoe therapy duration of 52 months, significantly fewer test group patients (16.2%) than control patients (54.0%) developed ADRs attributed to the conventional therapy [adjusted odds ratio, OR (95% confidence interval, CI), OR = 0.47 (0.32-0.67), p < 0.001]. In the test group, the majority of the symptoms disappeared more frequently, and overall mortality hazard was significantly lower [adjusted hazard ratio, HR (95% CI), HR = 0.46 (0.22-0.96), p = 0.038] than in the control group. Systemic ADRs attributed to the test treatment developed in 0.8%, and local ADRs in 17.3% of the patients. ADR severity was mild to intermediate. Tumor enhancement was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Complementary therapy of patients with primary, non-metastatic breast carcinoma with the mistletoe extract Iscador was safe and in comparison to the control group within the same study cohort showed considerably fewer ADRs attributed to concurrent conventional therapy, reduced disease symptoms, and suggested a significant improvement of survival. Despite some methodical limitations that require careful study planning and conduction as well as critical interpretation, the applied study design seems suitable to evaluate the efficacy and safety of drugs with ""well-established use"", particularly in oncology.",0
Recurrence-free survival in breast cancer improved by adjuvant tamoxifen--especially for progesterone receptor positive tumors with a high proliferation.,"Although the beneficial effect on breast cancer of adjuvant tamoxifen (TAM) is well established, in the series studied by our group this effect seems to have been restricted to patients with steroid receptor (especially progesterone receptor (PgR)) positive tumors. However, as some patients with PgR-positive tumors manifested recurrence despite adjuvant TAM treatment, the question arose whether some other biological factor(s) could be used to identify these non-responding cases. The level of the S-phase fraction (SPF), as measured by flow cytometry, has been shown to be a useful prognostic marker, prognosis being better in cases where the SPF is low than in those where it is high. The aim of the present study was to relate the prognosis after adjuvant TAM to SPF among patients with PgR-positive tumors. In the PgR-positive group as a whole, the effect of TAM on prognosis was more pronounced in the high SPF group than in the low SPF group (p = 0.005) the respective decrease in 3 year recurrence rate was from 19 to 43% and from 17 to 9%. Multivariate analysis of the data for the TAM-treated group showed the level of PgR concentration (low positive vs. high positive), lymph node status, and tumor size to be independent predictive factors, but not the level of SPF (i.e. high vs. low). By contrast, among patients not treated with TAM, the SPF was a strong independent prognostic factor. To sum up, SPF was a strong independent predictor of outcome only for patients receiving no systemic adjuvant therapy, but not in patients receiving adjuvant TAM. Patients with PgR-positive and high S-phase tumors derived more benefit from TAM than patients with PgR-positive and low SPF tumors.",0
Chemotherapy with or without oophorectomy in high-risk premenopausal patients with operable breast cancer.,"A prospective randomized trial to assess the impact of adding oophorectomy to adjuvant chemotherapy has been conducted in premenopausal patients with operable breast cancer and with metastases in four or more axillary lymph nodes. Following at least total mastectomy and axillary clearance, 327 evaluable patients were randomized to adjuvant oophorectomy followed by chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide (C), methotrexate (M), 5-fluorouracil (F), and prednisone (p) or to CMFp alone. At 48 months of median follow-up, no statistically significant differences between regimens in terms of disease-free survival or overall survival were demonstrated, even for patients with steroid hormone receptor-containing tumors. A high incidence of amenorrhea (89%) due to ovarian function suppression was observed for the group receiving CMFp alone. Supplementation of the adjuvant therapy regimen by surgical oophorectomy is rendered superfluous by this effect of cytotoxic treatment. The addition of oophorectomy to combination chemotherapy with CMFp cannot be recommended as adjuvant treatment for high-risk (four or more axillary lymph nodes involved) premenopausal patients with operable breast cancer.",1
Polyadenylic-polyuridylic acid as adjuvant in the treatment of operable breast cancer: recent results.,"A randomized trial of polyadenylic-polyuridylic acid (Poly(A).Poly(U) given as an adjuvant in the treatment of operable breast cancer, has included 300 patients of the Institut Gustave-Roussy from September 1972 to December 1979; 145 patients were allocated to conventional treatment alone and 155 to conventional treatment plus Poly(A).Poly(U). Reviews after mean periods of follow-up of 50 and 87 months were previously published. The present review performed after a mean follow-up period of 111 months confirmed a significant increase in the overall survival of patients with invaded nodes treated with Poly(A).Poly(U). The best results were achieved in the subset of patients with up to three affected nodes who showed a significant increase of both overall and relapse-free survival. The benefit seemed to be greater in postmenopausal women (P = 0.07). Present status of other ongoing trials of adjuvant Poly(A).Poly(U) is presented.",0
Celecoxib anti-aromatase neoadjuvant (CAAN) trial for locally advanced breast cancer: preliminary report.,"Anti-aromatase therapy is important in the treatment of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors have been shown to be effective in chemoprevention in animal and clinical studies. A proof of principle study was performed to investigate the efficacy of combing anti-aromatase therapy (exemestane) and COX-2 inhibitors neoadjuvantly in hormone-sensitive postmenopausal breast cancers. The initial results are reported. The patients were randomly assigned to receive exemestane 25 mg daily and celecoxib 400 mg twice daily (group A), exemestane 25 mg daily (group B) and letrozole 2.5 mg daily (group C). The analysis was based on 20 patients who received at least one cycle of treatment. Fourteen patients completed two cycles and 12 patients three cycles. All groups showed clinical response and there was decrease in tumor area in each group. However, complete clinical response was only observed for group A patients. There was also progressive decline in blood CEA and CA15.3 levels but the differences between the three groups were not significant. The results of the preliminary analysis are encouraging but definitive conclusion could only be drawn after the completion of the study.",1
Oral versus im administration of high-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate in pretreated patients with advanced breast cancer.,"In a multicenter trial, 123 patients with advanced breast cancer who had been treated with tamoxifen and/or chemotherapy were randomized to receive medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) orally 300 mg X 3 daily or im 500 mg daily for 4 weeks and 500 mg X 2 weekly thereafter. All case histories were reviewed extramurally by the criteria of the International Union Against Cancer. Five and 11 patients were not eligible and evaluable for response, respectively. Pretreatment characteristics were well balanced in both treated groups. Twenty-five of all 107 (23%) evaluable patients achieved an objective remission, whereas in a further 15% the disease became stable after previous progression. Results in both treatment arms did not differ significantly. The median duration of objective remission was 12 and 14 months for orally and im treated patients, respectively (P greater than 0.10). No statistically significant differences in the survival times of orally and im treated patients were found. Pretreatment characteristics positively correlated with an objective remission during MPA therapy in both groups were age greater than 50 years (P less than 0.02) and no previous chemotherapy (P less than 0.01). Toxicity included an increase in body weight, cushingoid effects, muscle cramps, and tremors in both groups. In four patients on im therapy, local infections developed. Mean serum MPA levels reached values above 100 ng/ml in nine orally and eight im treated patients (P greater than 0.10), and neither differed significantly in the patients responding to or failing therapy. In both MPA arms, plasma cortisol levels were suppressed. The drop in plasma cortisol levels was more pronounced in patients with objective remissions than in patients who failed (P = 0.04). In conclusion, oral and im MPA in the given doses had similar activity. Im administration of MPA should be reserved for patients not able to take oral medication.",1
"Influence of activation state of ErbB-2 (HER-2) on response to adjuvant cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil for stage II, node-positive breast cancer: study 8541 from the Cancer and Leukemia Group B.","PURPOSE: ErbB-2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) overexpression may be predictive of relative resistance and/or sensitivity to specific chemotherapeutic agents. Results from a previous study from the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB 8541) demonstrated an interaction between ErbB-2 and increasing dose of adjuvant cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF) chemotherapy. Other studies have suggested that evaluation of the phosphorylated/activated form of ErbB-2 might be more precise in defining the impact of ErbB-2 in breast cancer. We have evaluated tumor tissue sections from CALGB 8541 patients to determine whether the interaction of ErbB-2 with CAF dose is dependent on ErbB-2 activation state, and whether phosphorylated ErbB-2 is an adverse prognostic factor in patients treated with CAF. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to one of three dosing regimens of CAF. Paraffin samples from 992 of 1,572 patients who participated in CALGB 8541 were available. Of the 570 tumors with any staining for ErbB-2, 488 had tissue available for assay for phosphorylated ErbB-2, which was performed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Of 910 total assessable cases, 112 of 488 ErbB-2-positive cases (23%) stained positively for phosphorylated ErbB-2. The previously described interaction of dosing regimen of CAF with ErbB-2 was not dependent on phosphorylation status of ErbB-2. CONCLUSION: Monitoring phosphorylation of ErbB-2 with an antiphospho-ErbB-2 antibody did not add further precision to identifying those patients most likely to benefit from increased dose of anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy. Favorable outcomes are observed in ErbB-2-overexpressing patients treated with high-dose CAF regardless of ErbB-2 phosphorylation state.",1
"Postoperative dose-dense sequential chemotherapy with epirubicin, followed by CMF with or without paclitaxel, in patients with high-risk operable breast cancer: a randomized phase III study conducted by the Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group.","PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to explore the effect of dose-dense sequential chemotherapy with or without paclitaxel primarily on disease-free survival (DFS) and secondarily on overall survival (OS) in patients with high-risk operable breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From June 1997 until November 2000, 604 patients with T1-3N1M0 or T3N0M0 tumors were randomized to three cycles of epirubicin 110 mg/m2 followed by three cycles of paclitaxel 250 mg/m2 followed by three cycles of 'intensified' CMF (cyclophosphamide 840 mg/m2, methotrexate 47 mg/m2 and fluorouracil 840 mg/m2) (group A), or to four cycles of epirubicin followed by four cycles of CMF, as in group A (group B). All cycles were given every 2 weeks with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support. RESULTS: A total of 595 patients were eligible. Median follow-up was 61.7 months for group A and 62 months for group B. The 3-year DFS was 80% in group A and 77% in group B. Survival rates were 93% and 90%, respectively. The effect of treatment on the hazard of death was different according to hormonal receptor status. More specifically, in patients with negative receptor status the hazard of death was significantly higher for group B (hazard ratio 2.42). Both regimens were well tolerated and severe acute side-effects were infrequent. No cases of severe cardiotoxicity or acute leukemia were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: The present study failed to demonstrate a significant difference in DFS or OS between the two treatment groups. However, our study has shown clearly that high-dose paclitaxel can be safely incorporated to dose-dense sequential chemotherapy.",1
Survival advantage of adjuvant chemotherapy in high-risk node-negative breast cancer: ten-year analysis--an intergroup study.,"PURPOSE: Preliminary analysis showed that adjuvant chemotherapy is effective in improving disease-free survival (DFS) among high-risk breast cancer patients. This report updates the analysis of the high-risk group and reports the results of the low-risk group. METHODS: Patients who had undergone a modified radical mastectomy or a total mastectomy with low-axillary sampling, with negative axillary nodes and either an estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) tumor of any size or an estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) tumor that measured > or = 3 cm (high-risk) were randomized to receive six cycles of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil, and prednisone (CMFP) or no further treatment. Patients with ER+ tumors less than 3 cm (low-risk) were monitored without therapy. RESULTS: DFS and overall survival (OS) at 10 years were 73% and 81%, respectively, among patients who received chemotherapy, as compared with 58% and 71% in the observation group (P=.0006 for DFS and P=.02 for OS). Chemotherapy was beneficial for patients with large tumors, both ER+ and ER-, showing a 10-year DFS of 70% versus 51 % (P=.0009) and OS of 75% versus 65% (P=.06). Ten-year survival was 77% among low-risk patients, 85% among premenopausal patients, and 73% in the postmenopausal group. CONCLUSION: The observed 37% reduction in risk of recurrence and 34% reduction in mortality risk at 10 years, associated with a 15.4% absolute benefit in disease-free state and 10.1% in survival, reaffirm the role of adjuvant chemohormonal therapy in the management of high-risk node-negative breast cancer. Tumor size remains a significant prognostic factor associated with recurrence and survival in the low-risk group.",0
Phase III trial of liposomal doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide compared with epirubicin and cyclophosphamide as first-line therapy for metastatic breast cancer.,"OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the efficacy and tolerability of non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (Myocet) and epirubicin combined with cyclophosphamide in the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer. METHODS: One hundred and sixty anthracycline-naïve metastatic breast cancer patients were randomised to receive Myocet (M; 75 mg/m(2)) or epirubicin (E; 75 mg/m(2)) in combination with cyclophosphamide (C; 600 mg/m(2)), every 3 weeks for up to eight cycles. OUTCOME MEASURES: Response (overall response = complete + partial response rates), time to disease progression, overall survival and cardiac function (left ventricular ejection fraction). RESULTS: Overall response rates were 46% and 39% for MC and EC treatment, respectively (P=0.42). MC was superior to EC with respect to median time to treatment failure (5.7 versus 4.4 months; P=0.01) and median time to disease progression (7.7 versus 5.6 months; P=0.02). Median survival times were 18.3 and 16.0 months for MC and EC, respectively (P=0.504). Unsurprisingly, given an equimolar comparison, neutropenia and stomatitis/mucositis were significantly more common in patients who received MC. However, there was less injection site toxicity with MC. Both treatments showed a low incidence of cardiotoxicity. CONCLUSION: Myocet appears to be an acceptable alternative to epirubicin as a first-line treatment for patients with metastatic breast cancer because it combines the dose-effect reliability of doxorubicin with the level of safety provided by epirubicin.",1
Mitozantrone and methotrexate chemotherapy with and without mitomycin C in the treatment of advanced breast cancer: a randomised clinical trial.,"Patients with advanced breast cancer were randomised to 3M (mitozantrone 6.5 mg/m2q 21 days, methotrexate 30 mg/m2q 21 days, mitomycin C 6.5 mg/m2q 42 days) or 2M (as 3M but without mitomycin C). The objective response rates of 30% in 51 evaluable patients receiving 3M and 26% of 54 patients receiving 2M were not significantly different. 4/16 patients not responding to 2M responded to 3M on crossover. Both regimes were well tolerated but there was significantly less haematological toxicity and fewer dose reductions and delays with 2M. We conclude that patients should initially be treated with 2M and that non-responding patients should be crossed to 3M.",1
"Epirubicin followed by cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil versus paclitaxel followed by epirubicin and vinorelbine in patients with high-risk operable breast cancer.","OBJECTIVE: Breast cancer patients with >3 involved nodes (N+) have a poor outcome. Chemotherapy (CT), alone or combined with endocrine therapy (ET) in hormone receptor (HOR)-positive patients, is the standard for these women. However, there are still questions surrounding the optimal adjuvant CT regimen. METHODS: 244 patients with >3 N+ were randomized to receive either four 3-weekly courses of epirubicin (E: 100 mg/m(2), day 1) followed by four 4-weekly cycles of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF: 600, 40, 600 mg/m(2), days 1, 8: n = 122) or four 3-weekly courses of paclitaxel (T: 175 mg/m(2), day 1) followed by four 3-weekly cycles of epirubicin and vinorelbine (E: 75 mg/m(2), day 1; V: 25 mg/m(2), days 1, 8: n = 122). After CT, tamoxifen (plus an LH-RH analog in menstruating women) was given to all HOR-positive patients over a period of 5 years. Overall survival (OS) was the primary end point. Relapse-free survival (RFS) and toxicity were secondary end points. RESULTS: At a median follow-up time of 102 months (range 3-146), OS and RFS did not differ significantly between groups (E-CMF vs. T-EV: OS, HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.59-1.48, p = 0.8; RFS, HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.57-1.29, p = 0.45). The lack of any difference between assigned treatments was confirmed by multivariate analysis (E-CMF vs. T-EV: RFS, HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.64-1.48, p = 0.9). The 2 regimens showed different toxicity profiles. In fact, significantly more women assigned to E-CMF were affected by stomatitis (p = 0.001) while significantly more women in the T-EV group developed peripheral neuropathy (p < 0.0001) and musculoskeletal disorders (p < 0.0001). However, side effects were moderate and manageable and no toxic death occurred in either arm of the study. CONCLUSIONS: T-EV was safe and moderately toxic but was not superior to E-CMF.",1
"Assessment of quality of life in MA.17: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of letrozole after 5 years of tamoxifen in postmenopausal women.","PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of letrozole compared with placebo after adjuvant tamoxifen on quality of life (QOL) in the MA.17 trial. METHODS: Patients completed the Short Form 36-item Health Survey (SF-36) and the Menopause Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MENQOL) at baseline, 6 months, and annually. Mean change scores from baseline were compared between groups for summary measures and domains. A response analysis compared the proportion of patients who demonstrated an important change in QOL. RESULTS: Of 5,187 randomly assigned women in the trial, 3,612 (69.9%) participated in the QOL substudy: 1,799 were allocated to placebo and 1,813 were allocated to letrozole. No differences were seen between groups in mean change scores from baseline for the SF-36 physical and mental component summary scores at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. Small (< 0.2 standard deviations) but statistically significant differences in mean change scores from baseline were seen for the SF-36 domains of physical functioning (12 months), bodily pain (6 months) and vitality (6 and 12 months), and the MENQOL vasomotor (6, 12, and 24 months) and sexual domains (12 and 24 months). On the response analysis, a significant difference was seen between groups for the bodily pain domain (percentage of patients reporting a worsening of QOL, 47% placebo v 51% letrozole; P = .009) and the vasomotor domain (22% placebo v 29% letrozole; P = .001). CONCLUSION: Letrozole did not have an adverse impact on overall QOL. Small effects were seen in some domains consistent with a minority of patients experiencing changes in QOL compatible with a reduction in estrogen synthesis.",0
Postsurgical adjuvant chemotherapy of stage II breast carcinoma with or without crossover to a non-cross-resistant regimen: a Cancer and Leukemia Group B study.,"PURPOSE: To compare two cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil, vincristine, and prednisone (CMFVP) regimens with a doxorubicin-based regimen--vinblastine, doxorubicin, thiotepa, and Halotestin (Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI) (VATH)--in patients with stage II node-positive breast carcinoma. METHODS: Nine hundred forty-five women were treated with a 6-week induction course of CMFVP. They were then randomized to receive one of two consolidation CMFVP regimens: 6-week courses or 2-week courses. Following completion of CMFVP consolidation, patients were again randomized to either continue the CMFVP regimen or to receive six escalating doses of VATH. RESULTS: Among all patients, with a median follow-up time of 11.5 years, there is no statistically significant difference in disease-free survival (DFS) between the two consolidation CMFVP regimens. VATH intensification treatment is statistically significantly superior to CMFVP in terms of DFS (P = .0040). For patients with one to three involved nodes, there is currently no significant difference between VATH and CMFVP; however, among those with four or more positive lymph nodes, there is a significant difference in favor of VATH (P = .0037). There is also improved overall survival with VATH (P = .043; median, > 14 years v 10 years). This difference is also statistically significant in patients with four or more involved lymph nodes, among postmenopausal patients, and among postmenopausal estrogen receptor-positive patients. CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy with crossover to escalating doses of VATH following CMFVP was well tolerated and effective. Inauguration of VATH as a treatment intensification at the eighth month produced a major increase in relapse-free and overall survival. The observation that sensitivity to VATH is retained so long after mastectomy raises questions about the proper duration of adjuvant chemotherapy and lends support to further investigation of cross-over designs in future trials to postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy regimens.",1
HER2 and response to paclitaxel in node-positive breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: The status of human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) in breast-cancer cells predicts clinical outcomes in women who receive adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy. We hypothesized that HER2 positivity predicts a benefit from adjuvant doxorubicin doses above standard levels, from the addition of paclitaxel after adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide, or from both. METHODS: We randomly selected 1500 women from 3121 women with node-positive breast cancer who had been randomly assigned to receive doxorubicin (60, 75, or 90 mg per square meter of body-surface area) plus cyclophosphamide (600 mg per square meter) for four cycles, followed by four cycles of paclitaxel (175 mg per square meter) or observation. Tissue blocks from 1322 of these 1500 women were available. Immunohistochemical analyses of these tissue specimens for HER2 with the CB11 monoclonal antibody against HER2 or with a polyclonal-antibody assay kit and fluorescence in situ hybridization for HER2 amplification were performed. RESULTS: No interaction was observed between HER2 positivity and doxorubicin doses above 60 mg per square meter. HER2 positivity was, however, associated with a significant benefit from paclitaxel. The interaction between HER2 positivity and the addition of paclitaxel to the treatment was associated with a hazard ratio for recurrence of 0.59 (P=0.01). Patients with a HER2-positive breast cancer benefited from paclitaxel, regardless of estrogen-receptor status, but paclitaxel did not benefit patients with HER2-negative, estrogen-receptor-positive cancers. CONCLUSIONS: The expression or amplification, or both, of HER2 by a breast cancer is associated with a benefit from the addition of paclitaxel after adjuvant treatment with doxorubicin (<60 mg per square meter) plus cyclophosphamide in node-positive breast cancer, regardless of estrogen-receptor status. Patients with HER2-negative, estrogen-receptor-positive, node-positive breast cancer may gain little benefit from the administration of paclitaxel after adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide.",1
Randomized cooperative study of perioperative chemotherapy in breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: The aim of this multicentric randomized trial was to determine whether reducing the interval between surgery and chemotherapy improves the outcome of breast cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 1985 and July 1992, 600 breast cancer patients, clinical stages T1-3A,N0-2,M0 were randomly assigned to a perioperative cycle (PC) of cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2, epidoxorubicin 60 mg/m2, and fluorouracil 600 mg/m2 (CEF). Node-negative (N-) patients did not receive any further treatment. Node positive (N+) patients received 11 cycles if previously given PC, or 12 cycles of CEF alternated with cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2, methotrexate 40 mg/m2, and fluorouracil 600 mg/m2 (CMF). In addition, N+ patients received concomitant or sequential 5-year tamoxifen therapy. RESULTS: At a median follow-up duration of 5.7 years, no significant difference in survival (88% v 84%, P = .3) between the two treatment arms was seen. However, a difference of borderline significance in relapse-free survival (RFS; 76% v 70%, P = .053) was evident. A significant survival advantage for the PC arm was detected only in the estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) patients (P = .003). RFS was significantly improved in N- patients, postmenopausal patients, and ER- patients. Multivariate analyses show that pathologic tumor size, nodal status, receptor status, and treatment (only in ER- patients) are significantly correlated with survival and RFS. PC toxicity did not influence wound healing. CONCLUSION: This study provides preliminary evidence that PC positively affects relapse rate and survival in some subgroups, namely, ER- patients.",0
Differential response to chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer in relation to estrogen receptor level. Results of a prospective randomized study.,"The predictive value of estrogen receptor (ER) level for response to chemotherapy was studied in 182 patients with metastatic breast cancer in a prospective study. Patients were stratified according to ER status and dominant site of disease and randomized to one of three regimens: cyclophosphamide, 5-Fluorouracil, and prednisone (CFP) versus CFP, methotrexate, and vincristine (CFPMV) versus doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC). There was no significant differences in all response categories (P = 0.21), was taken as a predictor for response to chemotherapy, there was no significant difference in overall response (P = 0.61) between ER+ (62/108, 57%) and ER- patients (31/49, 63%). However, there was a significant trend toward a higher degree of response in ER- patients (more complete response [CR] nine of 49, 18%, and fewer failures six of 49, 12%) than in ER+ (less CR seven of 108, 7%, and more failures 37/108, 34%) (P = 0.006). Patients with higher measured levels of ER showed worse response (Kendall's tau C, P = 0.026). This trend for ER- patients to have better response than ER+ patients was generally consistent, regardless of the predominant site of metastases or chemotherapy regimen (P = 0.04 for CFP; P = 0.08 for CFPMV; and P = 0.20 for AC). The advantage of a better response for ER- patients was nullified by an earlier relapse which was reflected in longer duration of remission, time to treatment failure, and survival in favor of ER+ patients (12.3 months versus 7.3 months remission duration, 18.7 months versus 13.6 months survival in partial responders). These data suggest that ER- patients respond to a higher extent to chemotherapy but relapse sooner than ER+ patients, suggesting a more rapid growth for ER- tumors. In patients with ER- tumors and poorer prognosis on conventional chemotherapy, new trials of intensive consolidation after response should be considered.",0
A randomised controlled trial of prophylactic levonorgestrel intrauterine system in tamoxifen-treated women.,"OBJECTIVE: To study the prophylactic use of levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) in the prevention of endometrial pathology in women having breast cancer treated with tamoxifen. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial. SETTING: A tertiary teaching hospital. POPULATION: One hundred and thirteen women (66 premenopausal/47 postmenopausal) who required adjuvant tamoxifen for breast cancer after the completion of postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy. METHODS: Women were randomised to treatment group (prophylactic LNG-IUS insertion before the commencement of tamoxifen) or control group. Uterine cavity was examined by outpatient hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy before and at 12 months after commencement of tamoxifen. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: De novo endometrial pathology at 1 year of tamoxifen. RESULTS: Women in the treatment group had a much lower incidence of endometrial polyp (1.8 versus 15.5%, P= 0.017) (relative risk: 0.12; 95% CI: 0.02-0.91) at 12 months. There was no significant difference in the incidence of submucosal fibroid between the two groups (1.8 versus 3.4%, P= 1.0). LNG-IUS was retained in 95% women in the treatment group at 1 year. CONCLUSION: LNG-IUS reduces the occurrence of de novo endometrial polyp in women treated with tamoxifen for breast cancer.",0
Menopausal hormone therapy after breast cancer: the Stockholm randomized trial.,"In 1997 two independent randomized clinical trials, Hormonal Replacement Therapy After Breast Cancer--Is It Safe? (HABITS; 434 patients) and the Stockholm trial (378 patients), were initiated in Sweden to compare menopausal hormone therapy with no menopausal hormone therapy after diagnosis of early-stage breast cancer. Much of the design of both studies was similar; however, a goal of the Stockholm protocol, not shared with the HABITS trial, was to minimize the use of progestogen combined with estrogen. The HABITS trial was prematurely stopped in December 2003, because, at a median follow-up of 2.1 years, the risk for recurrence of breast cancer among patients receiving menopausal hormone therapy was statistically significantly higher (relative hazard [RH] = 3.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.5 to 7.4) than among those receiving no treatment. In the Stockholm trial, however, at a median follow-up of 4.1 years, the risk of breast cancer recurrence was not associated with menopausal hormone therapy (RH = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.35 to 1.9). Statistically significant heterogeneity in the rate of recurrence was observed (P = .02; two-sided likelihood-ratio test) between the two studies, indicating that chance may not be the only explanation. Doses of estrogen and progestogen and treatment regimens for menopausal hormone therapy may be associated with the recurrence of breast cancer.",0
Raloxifene reduces risk of vertebral fractures [corrected] in postmenopausal women regardless of prior hormone therapy.,"OBJECTIVE: We examined whether past use of hormone therapy influences the effects of raloxifene on the risk of new vertebral fracture, cardiovascular events, or breast cancer. STUDY DESIGN: The Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation (MORE) trial examined vertebral fracture incidence as the primary endpoint, breast cancer incidence as a secondary endpoint. Cardiovascular events were collected as secondary safety endpoints. POPULATION: The MORE trial enrolled 7705 postmenopausal women. Of the 7682 women who reported their previous HT use status, 29% used HT before screening. OUTCOMES MEASURED: Separate logistic regression models analyzed the relationships between prior HT use and the risk of vertebral fracture, cardiovascular events, or breast cancer. Interaction terms with P<.10 were considered to be statistically significant. Confidence intervals for relative risks (RR) were calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel method. RESULTS: Raloxifene 60 mg/d, the clinically approved dose for osteoporosis prevention and treatment, reduced the risk of vertebral fractures by 54% (RR=0.46) and 29% (RR=0.71) in women with and without prior HT use, respectively (interaction P=.05). A lower incidence of invasive breast cancer in women with prior HT use (RR=0.23) and in women without prior HT use [RR=0.31; interaction P=.60] was observed in women receiving raloxifene (pooled doses). Irrespective of prior HT use, women treated with raloxifene (pooled doses) had no change in incidence of cardiovascular events (interaction P=.56). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of vertebral fractures was lower in women treated with raloxifene, regardless of prior HT use, but there was a suggestion that the effect was greater in women who had used HT. Women randomized to receive raloxifene exhibited a decreased incidence of invasive breast cancer, compared with women receiving placebo. No change occurred in the incidence of cardiovascular events, regardless of prior HT use.",0
"Adjuvant CMFVP versus tamoxifen versus concurrent CMFVP and tamoxifen for postmenopausal, node-positive, and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients: a Southwest Oncology Group study.","PURPOSE: To compare chemohormonal therapy, chemotherapy alone, and hormonal therapy alone in postmenopausal patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive operable breast cancer and positive axillary nodes with respect to survival and disease-free survival (DFS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight hundred ninety-two postmenopausal women with ER-positive, node-positive breast cancer were enrolled by the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) from July 1979 to March 1989 and 74 by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) between June 1987 and March 1989. Patients were stratified according to number of involved nodes and type of primary surgery and randomized to receive the following: (1) tamoxifen 10 mg twice daily by mouth for 1 year; (2) cyclophosphamide 60 mg/m2/d by mouth for 1 year, methotrexate 15 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) weekly for 1 year, fluorouracil (5-FU) 400 mg/m2 IV weekly for 1 year, vincristine .625 mg/m2 IV weekly for the first 10 weeks, and prednisone during weeks 1 to 10 with doses decreasing from 30 mg/m2 to 2.5 mg/m2 (CMFVP); or (3) the combination of tamoxifen and CMFVP. RESULTS: The median follow-up duration is 6.5 years, with a maximum of 12.8 years. Treatment arms are not significantly different with respect to either survival or DFS (log-rank, 2 df, P = .82 and .23, respectively). The 5-year survival rate is 77% for the tamoxifen arm, 78% for CMFVP, and 75% for the combination. No significant differences were observed in node or receptor level subsets. Severe or worse toxicity was experienced by 56% of patients on CMFVP and 61% on CMFVP plus tamoxifen, compared with 5% on tamoxifen alone. CONCLUSION: CMFVP chemotherapy, either alone or in combination with tamoxifen, has not been shown to be superior to tamoxifen alone in the treatment of postmenopausal women with node-positive, ER-positive, operable breast cancer.",1
"Combination of cyclophosphamide, adriamycin and platinum (CAP) versus 5-fluorouracil, adriamycin and cyclophosphamide (FAC) as primary treatment in metastatic breast cancer: results of a prospective randomized study.","Based on favorable results we reported earlier with the CAP regimen in breast cancer (CAP vs CMFVP), the present study compared the CAP with the FAC regimen, which is so far one of the most active adriamycin containing chemotherapy regimens in breast cancer. The aim of the study was to find the optimal first line treatment and possibly evaluate the role of cis platinum in breast cancer chemotherapy. The CAP schedule consisted of cyclophosphamide 200 mg/m2 i.v. days 1, 3 and 5, adriamycin 40 mg/m2 i.v. day 1, and platinum 30 mg/m2 i.v. day 1, 3 and 5. The FAC schedule included 5-FU 500 mg/m2 days 1 and 8, adriamycin 50 mg/m2 day 1, and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 day 1. One hundred and twenty-six previously untreated patients received greater than 2 cycles and were evaluated. In the CAP arm 15 complete (26%) and 24 partial remissions were observed, resulting in a 67% overall response rate (39/58). The response in soft tissue and visceral organs was notable (78% - 22/28, 71% - 15/21) with an important complete response rate (32%). In the FAC arm there was an overall response in 41% (28/68) of patients, with 8 complete (12%) and 20 partial responses. The difference in overall response, complete response, and response in soft tissue and visceral organs, was statistically significant in favor of the CAP arm (P less than 0.005). Concerning bone metastases there was no difference between the two schedules in response rate, nor in the median remission duration (CAP 11, FAC 10 months). In spite of a somewhat longer median survival in the CAP group, the difference (13 months vs 9 months) was not statistically significant (P = 0.10). Toxicity was moderate and tolerable in both regimens with more pronounced myelosuppression and vomiting in the CAP group. Compared with the FAC schedule the platinum containing combination chemotherapy (CAP) showed higher antitumor activity with no reflection on remission duration and survival.",1
"Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised phase II trial of IH636 grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) in patients with radiation-induced breast induration.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Tissue hardness (induration), pain and tenderness are common late adverse effects of curative radiotherapy for early breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of IH636 grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) in patients with tissue induration after high-dose radiotherapy for early breast cancer in a double-blind placebo-controlled randomised phase II trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-six eligible research volunteers with moderate or marked breast induration at a mean 10.8 years since radiotherapy for early breast cancer were randomised to active drug (n = 44) or placebo (n = 22). All patients were given grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) 100 mg three times a day orally, or corresponding placebo capsules, for 6 months. The primary endpoint was percentage change in surface area (cm(2)) of palpable breast induration measured at the skin surface 12 months after randomisation. Secondary endpoints included change in photographic breast appearance and patient self-assessment of breast hardness, pain and tenderness. RESULTS: At 12 months post-randomisation, > or =50% reduction in surface area (cm(2)) of breast induration was recorded in 13/44 (29.5%) GSPE and 6/22 (27%) placebo group patients (NS). At 12 months post-randomisation, there was no significant difference between treatment and control groups in terms of external assessments of tissue hardness, breast appearance or patient self-assessments of breast hardness, pain or tenderness. CONCLUSIONS: The study failed to show efficacy of orally-administered GSPE in patients with breast induration following radiotherapy for breast cancer.",0
Sequenced compared with simultaneous anthracycline and cyclophosphamide in high-risk stage I and II breast cancer: final analysis from INT-0137 (S9313).,"PURPOSE: We conducted a phase III randomized study of two adjuvant treatment schedules of doxorubicin (A) and cyclophosphamide (C) in early-stage breast cancer to determine if administration of sequential single agents (A --> C) results in superior disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) versus the same total dose given in combination (AC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: High-risk node-negative or low-risk node-positive breast cancer patients received AC given: (arm I) concurrently (AC) doxorubicin 54 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 1.2 g/m2 intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks for six cycles; or (arm II) in sequence (A C) doxorubicin 40.5 mg/m2 IV days 1 and 2 every 3 weeks for four cycles followed by cyclophosphamide 2.4 gm/m2 IV every 2 weeks for three cycles. Total dose and duration were identical, but the intensity of each drug was increased on A C. Both arms included granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support and prophylactic antibiotics. All but premenopausal women with receptor negative tumors received tamoxifen after chemotherapy. RESULTS: Between 1994 and 1997, 3,176 patients were randomly assigned. Arms were well balanced; 48% of eligible patients were node-negative and 48% were estrogen receptor-positive. No significant differences in OS or DFS were observed; 5-year estimates of OS (95% CI) were 88% (87% to 90%) on AC and 89% (87% to 91%) on A --> C. Grade 4 hematologic toxicity was greater on A --> C, but nonhematological grade 4 was similar. CONCLUSION: The overall result does not support superiority of dose-intense sequenced single agents. The greater toxicity of higher doses of single agents does not support their sequential use.",1
Combined doxorubicin and paclitaxel in advanced breast cancer: effective and cardiotoxic.,"BACKGROUND: Paclitaxel has shown activity in metastatic breast cancer, including anthracycline-resistant breast cancer. The efficacy, toxicity and optimal scheduling of the combination of the two drugs needs to be defined. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty women with advanced breast cancer who had undergone at most one prior adjuvant chemotherapy regimen, were treated at three different dose levels with doxorubicin (50, 60 and 60 mg/m2) followed 30 minutes later by paclitaxel (155, 175 and 200 mg/m2, respectively) every 3 weeks. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 83% (95% CI: 64-94), with 24% of patients achieving CR. The median response duration for complete responders was 11 months (range 4-14+) and median survival 18 months (range 3-28+). Two hundred sixty-five treatment courses were given (median 9, range 3-13) and the median cumulative dose of doxorubicin was 369 mg/m2 (range 114-550). The main toxicities were neutropenia, parestesia, nausea/vomiting, alopecia, myalgia and cardiotoxicity. Fifteen patients (50%) had reductions of left ventricular ejection fraction of below normal levels and 6 of these patients (20%) developed congestive heart failure. CONCLUSION: The combination of doxorubicin and paclitaxel is highly active, but is accompanied by the dose-limiting toxic effects of neutropenia, neuropathy and cardiotoxicity.",1
Doxorubicin versus mitomycin versus doxorubicin plus mitomycin in advanced breast cancer: a randomized study.,"In a randomized trial the antineoplastic and toxic effects of doxorubicin (ADR), mitomycin (MMC), and the combination of the two were evaluated in postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer using the following treatment regimens: ADR (75 mg/m2 by iv bolus every 3 weeks); MMC (20 mg/m2 by iv bolus every 6 weeks); and ADR (45 mg/m2 by iv bolus every 3 weeks) and MMC (10 mg/m2 by iv bolus every 6 weeks). One hundred one patients were entered in the study. Entrance to single-agent MMC therapy was stopped after allocation of 12 patients because of unacceptable side effects, especially nausea and vomiting, and the suggestion of minor efficacy. One of these patients had partial response, eight had no change, and three had progressive disease. The patients in the ADR and ADR plus MMC group were similar as to the following: age (median, 60 years); menopausal age; disease-free interval; performance status, extent of previous cytotoxic therapy (approximately 90% were pretreated) and radiation therapy; and dominant site of disease but with significantly more involved organ sites in the ADR plus MMC group. Among evaluable patients (42 in the ADR group and 39 in the ADR plus MMC group), response rates were as follows: complete response--21 versus five; partial response--26 versus 44; no change--40 versus 38; and progressive disease--12 versus 13 (P greater than 0.10). Median times to disease progression were 5.2 and 7.8 months, respectively (log-rank test, P = 0.03), but survival times were similar, 9.3 and 10.2 months, respectively (log-rank test, P greater than 0.40). For the two treatment groups suppression of wbc count was similar, while anemia, thrombopenia, and nausea and vomiting were significantly more common among the ADR plus MMC-treated group. Five treatment-induced deaths were observed in the ADR plus MMC group (one from sepsis; two from diffuse hemorrhage; and two from cardiomyopathy), compared to none in the ADR group. In conclusion, this study disclosed no major advantage of the combination of ADR plus MMC compared to ADR alone as second-line treatment of advanced breast cancer, but results from other studies may imply a possible role of MMC as part of second-line combination chemotherapy regimens.",1
Endometrial protection from tamoxifen-stimulated changes by a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system: a randomised controlled trial.,"INTRODUCTION: Tamoxifen is currently the most commonly used adjuvant treatment for breast cancer, however, it frequently causes episodes of unscheduled uterine bleeding, which could be associated with proliferative changes of the endometrium, or even endometrial cancer. We aimed to assess whether a levonorgestrel intrauterine system could modulate the uterine responses to tamoxifen. We also aimed to assess women's tolerance of the screening procedures, the insertion, removal, and potential side-effects of the device. METHODS: We did a randomised controlled trial, in which postmenopausal women who had had at least 1 year of adjuvant tamoxifen treatment and who were undergoing regular follow-up for breast cancer were randomly assigned to either endometrial surveillance alone, or endometrial surveillance before and after insertion of the levonorgestrel intrauterine system for 12 months. We assessed tolerance of the surveillance procedures and the device with visual analogue scales. FINDINGS: Baseline assessment showed only benign uterine changes in all women (n=122). Hysteroscopic assessment indicated a uniform decidual response (confirmed histologically in 40 of 41 cases) in all women fitted with the intrauterine system; there were no new polyps in these women and 13% had fewer fibroids than in controls. Both screening procedures and device were well tolerated. There was an excess of bleeding in the women fitted with intrauterine systems but this resolved to a baseline similar to those receiving surveillance only. INTERPRETATION: The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system had a protective action against the uterine effects of tamoxifen. The effectiveness of this device in preventing uterine changes in the endometrium needs to be assessed in the context of decreasing the need for repeated investigations of postmenopausal bleeding in women taking tamoxifen.",0
Anemia during adjuvant non-taxane chemotherapy for early breast cancer: Incidence and risk factors from two trials of the International Breast Cancer Study Group.,"UNLABELLED: GOAL OF THE WORK: Anemia is a common side effect of chemotherapy. Limited information exists about its incidence and risk factors. The objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence of anemia and risk factors for anemia occurrence in patients with early breast cancer who received adjuvant chemotherapy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated risk factors for anemia in pre- and post/perimenopausal patients with lymph node-positive early breast cancer treated with adjuvant chemotherapy in two randomized trials. All patients received four cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) followed by three cycles of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil (CMF). Anemia incidence was related to baseline risk factors. Multivariable analysis used logistic and Cox regression.MAIN RESULTS: Among the 2,215 available patients, anemia was recorded in 11% during adjuvant chemotherapy. Grade 2 and 3 anemia occurred in 4 and 1% of patients, respectively. Pretreatment hemoglobin and white blood cells (WBC) were significant predictors of anemia. Adjusted odds ratios (logistic regression) comparing highest versus lowest quartiles were 0.18 (P < 0.0001) for hemoglobin and 0.52 (P = 0.0045) for WBC. Age, surgery type, platelets, body mass index, and length of time from surgery to chemotherapy were not significant predictors. Cox regression results looking at time to anemia were similar.CONCLUSIONS: Moderate or severe anemia is rare among patients treated with AC followed by CMF. Low baseline hemoglobin and WBC are associated with a higher risk of anemia.",0
Photodynamic therapy of locoregional breast cancer recurrences using a chlorin-type photosensitizer.,"Chest wall recurrences are a frequent problem in patients treated by mastectomy for breast cancer. Surgery and ionizing radiation are established treatment modalities in these cases. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) provides an alternative treatment modality using a photosensitizer and laser light to induce selective tumor necrosis. PDT was performed as compassionate use in 7 patients aged 57.6 years (+/-12.6 SD). A total of 89 metastatic skin nodes were treated in 11 PDT sessions. As photosensitizer meta-tetra(hydroxyphenyl)chlorin (m-THPC) was applied intravenously. Patients (n = 3) photosensitized with a drug dose of 0.10 mg/kg bodyweight were irradiated 48 hr after drug application at a lightdose of 5 J/cm(2). Patients (n = 4) were illuminated by an optical dose of 10 J/cm(2) 96 hr after photosensitization with 0.15 mg/kg. Laser light at a wavelength of 652 nm was generated by a diode laser and applied by a front lens light diffuser using a fluence rate of 20--25 mW/cm(2). PDT using m-THPC resulted in complete response in all patients. Response to treatment did not differ when using the 2 different drugdose protocols. Healing time depended mainly on the size of the illumination field but not on the lightdose. Pain score usually raised 1 day after PDT and lasted at higher levels for about 10 days. Healing time usually ranged between 8--10 weeks. Photodynamic technique offers a minimal-invasive, outpatient treatment modality for recurrent breast cancer on the chest wall with few side effects, high patient's satisfaction and with possible repetitive application.",0
Serum lipid profiles in patients receiving endocrine treatment for breast cancer--the results from the Celecoxib Anti-Aromatase Neoadjuvant (CAAN) Trial.,"BACKGROUND: Anti-aromatase therapy is important in the treatment of breast cancer. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors may be effective in chemoprevention. A proof of principle study was performed to investigate the efficacy and side effects including changes in lipid profiles of combining anti-aromatase therapy and COX-2 inhibitor preoperatively in hormone sensitive postmenopausal breast cancers. METHODS: From February 2002 to April 2003, 41 postmenopausal women with histologically proven LABC were recruited. The patients were randomly assigned to receive exemestane 25 mg daily and celecoxib 400 mg twice-daily (group A), exemestane 25 mg daily (group B) and letrozole 2.5 mg daily (group C. RESULTS: Observed clinical response rates were 61.5%, 60% and 54.5% for Groups A-C, respectively, with no pathologic complete response. Cholesterol levels for Group A dropped progressively and a statistical difference was observed between fifth week after operation and preoperative level (P = 0.026). In addition, Group A has significantly lowered cholesterol and LDL levels than Groups B and C after 18 weeks of treatment. CONCLUSION: The initial results show that different neoadjuvant anti-aromatase therapies has similar efficacy but the combination with celecoxib may have an advantageous effects on the serum lipid profiles.",0
Relationship of serum HER-2/neu and serum CA 15-3 in patients with metastatic breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Serum HER-2/neu antigen concentrations have been reported to correlate with increased tumor volume in patients with breast cancer. We measured serum CA 15-3, a surrogate marker of disease burden, and correlated serum CA 15-3 with serum HER-2/neu and analyzed the association of both markers with clinical outcomes. METHODS: Pretreatment serum samples from 566 patients were retrospectively analyzed from 2 phase III clinical trials of estrogen receptor-positive (ER(+)), ER(-)/progesterone receptor-positive, or ER status unknown metastatic breast cancer patients randomized in two similar studies to receive second-line hormone therapy with either megestrol acetate or an aromatase inhibitor (fadrozole). The extracellular domain of the HER-2/neu (c-erbB-2) oncogene and serum CA 15-3 were measured by ELISA on the Bayer Immuno 1. RESULTS: Serum HER-2/neu protein was increased in 168 patients (30%), and CA 15-3 was increased in 337 (60%) patients. Serum CA 15-3 and HER-2/neu were weakly correlated (r = 0.39; P <0.0001). The clinical benefit (complete responses plus partial responses plus stable disease) of endocrine therapy was significantly lower in patients with increased serum HER-2/neu. When adjusted for serum HER-2/neu, serum CA 15-3 was not predictive of response rates. The median time to progression was shorter in patients with increased serum HER-2/neu (89 days) compared with patients with normal serum HER-2/neu (176 days). Survival was significantly shorter in patients with increased serum HER-2/neu (513 vs 869 days; P <0.0001) or increased serum CA 15-3 (689 vs 939 days; P <0.0001). This observation was confirmed by multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Serum HER-2/neu is a significant independent predictive and prognostic factor in hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer, even when adjusted for tumor burden as measured by CA 15-3. The combination of increased serum HER-2/neu and increased serum CA 15-3 predicts a worse prognosis than does increased CA 15-3 alone.",0
A randomized comparison of haloperidol plus dexamethasone versus prochlorperazine plus dexamethasone in preventing nausea and vomiting in patients receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer.,"The antiemetic effectiveness of haloperidol plus dexamethasone was compared with that of prochlorperazine plus dexamethasone in a prospective study of patients receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer. Chemotherapy consisted of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or methotrexate, and fluorouracil in all patients. Patients who received the doxorubicin-containing combination experience significantly more nausea and vomiting than those who received the chemotherapy combination containing methotrexate. There was no significant difference between the two antiemetic regimens in the overall incidence of post-chemotherapy nausea and vomiting, but patients who received haloperidol and dexamethasone did have a lower incidence of severe vomiting. Neither regimen is highly effective, especially for the combination containing doxorubicin, and cannot be recommended as standard antiemetic therapy for this population of patients.",0
Cyclin D1 expression in breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant tamoxifen-based therapy.,"PURPOSE: The objective of our study was to determine the clinical relevance of cyclin D1 expression in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients who were treated with tamoxifen-based therapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We assessed expression of cyclin D1 in surgical specimens of breast carcinoma by means of immunohistochemistry. Patients had been enrolled in either Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group (ABCSG) Trial 05 or ABCSG Trial 06 and received tamoxifen as part of their adjuvant treatment. Overall survival and relapse-free survival were analyzed with Cox models adjusted for clinical and pathologic factors. RESULTS: Cyclin D1 was expressed in 140 of 253 (55%) tumors of ABCSG Trial 05 and in 569 of 948 (60%) tumors of ABCSG Trial 06. Expression of cyclin D1 was associated with poor outcome in both cohorts. Overall survival was significantly shorter in patients with cyclin D1-positive tumors compared with patients with cyclin D1-negative tumors [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for death (ABCSG Trial 05), 2.47; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.08-5.63; P = 0.03; adjusted HR for death (ABCSG Trial 06), 1.78; 95% CI, 1.36-2.34; P < 0.0001]. Relapse-free survival was also shorter in patients with cyclin D1-positive tumors than in patients with cyclin D1-negative tumors [adjusted HR for relapse (ABCSG Trial 05), 2.73; 95% CI, 1.50-4.96; P = 0.001; adjusted HR for relapse (ABCSG Trial 06), 1.52; 95% CI, 1.14-2.04; P = 0.005]. CONCLUSION: Cyclin D1 expression is an independent poor prognostic factor in women with early-stage, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer who received adjuvant tamoxifen-based therapy.",0
The International (Ludwig) Breast Cancer Study Group Trials I-IV: 15 years follow-up.,"BACKGROUND: Adjuvant systemic therapy prolongs disease-free and overall survival in both pre- and postmenopausal patients. Available data shown benefit from multi-agent chemotherapy, prolonged tamoxifen treatment, and ovarian ablation, and that the combination of chemo- and endocrine therapy might be advantageous. In 1978 the International (Ludwig) Breast Cancer Study Group (IBCSG) initiated four complementary randomized controlled clinical trials to evaluate the roles of chemo-endocrine combinations or endocrine therapy alone in specific populations defined by risk (for pre- and perimenopausal patients) or by age (for postmenopausal patients). The results at 10 and 13 years' median follow-up for these trials are summarized in this report and are compared to those of the Overview meta-analysis with regard to chemo-endocrine or endocrine therapy combinations. Furthermore, types of first relapses by sites and second malignant diseases are reported. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 1601 evaluable patients with node positive disease were included into the studies I-IV. In Trial I (491 premenopausal patients with 1-3 positive axillary nodes) we studied the addition of low-dose continuous prednisone (p) to a cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-fluorouracil (CMF) combination. In Trial II 327 premenopausal patients with four or more positive axillary nodes were randomized to one year CMFp or to a surgical oophorectomy followed by CMFp. In Trial III (463 postmenopausal patients 65 years old or younger), combined chemoendocrine therapy (one year of CMFp plus tamoxifen (T)) was compared to endocrine therapy (1 year of p + T) or to surgery alone. In Trial IV 320 postmenopausal patients 66 to 80 years old were treated either by surgery alone or by surgery followed by 1 year prednisone and tamoxifen. RESULTS: In Trial I the addition of prednisone allowed a higher dose of cytotoxics to be administered compared with CMF alone. Despite this increased dose intensity, 13-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were similar for the two treatment groups (49% vs. 52% DFS, 59% vs. 65% OS for CMFp vs. CMF). In Trial II the addition of surgical oophorectomy to CMFp yielded an improved outcome which approached statistical significance for the subset of 107 patients known to have estrogen receptor-positive tumors (DFS, 23% vs. 15%, p = 0.13; OS, 41% vs. 30%, p = 0.12). In Trial III combined chemoendocrine therapy improved DFS and OS compared with endocrine therapy alone (p + T) given for the same duration, or no adjuvant treatment (DFS, 35% vs. 25% vs. 14%, p < 0.0001; OS, 48% vs. 36% vs. 32%, p = 0.01). In Trial IV p + T improved DFS compared with no adjuvant therapy (27% vs. 15%, p = 0.004). Despite competing risks for this elderly population, OS was also improved but the result was not statistically significant (34% vs. 22%, p = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: The overall results of these four trials indicate that the continuation of investigations on combined chemo-endocrine therapies is warranted. The prognosis of the patients, all node-positive, treated with the most effective adjuvant treatment is such that there is a large potential for improvement.",0
Weekly docetaxel versus CMF as adjuvant chemotherapy for elderly breast cancer patients: safety data from the multicentre phase 3 randomised ELDA trial.,"Within an ongoing multicentre phase 3 randomised trial (ELDA, cancertrials.gov ID: NCT00331097), early breast cancer patients, 65-79 years old, with average to high risk of recurrence, are randomly assigned to receive CMF (cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2, methotrexate 40 mg/m2, fluorouracil 600 mg/m2, days 1-8) or docetaxel (35 mg/m2 days 1-8-15), every 4 weeks. Here we report an unplanned safety analysis prompted by an amendment introducing creatinine clearance as a tool to adjust methotrexate dose. Before such change, 101 patients with a median age of 70 were randomly assigned CMF (53 patients) or docetaxel (48 patients). At least one grades 3-4 toxic event of any type was reported in 40 (75.5%) and 19 (39.6%) patients with CMF and docetaxel, respectively (p=0.0002). Grades 3-4 hematological events were observed in 37 (69.8%) vs. 4 (8.3%) cases (p<0.0001) and grades 3-4 non-hematological toxicity in 12 (22.6%) vs. 15 (31.2%) patients (p=0.11), with CMF and docetaxel, respectively. A higher incidence of anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and febrile neutropenia was reported with CMF. Constipation, mucositis, nausea and vomiting were more common with CMF; diarrhoea, abdominal pain, dysgeusia, neuropathy and liver toxicity were more frequent with docetaxel. No significant interaction was found between the occurrence of severe toxicity and baseline variables, including creatinine clearance and geriatric activity scales. In conclusion, weekly docetaxel appears to be less toxic than CMF in terms of hematological toxicity.",1
"Clinical controlled trial in advanced breast cancer: CMFV (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil, vincristine) verus CD (carminomycin, dibromodulcitol).","A controlled study with two independent cytostatic combinations in advanced breast cancer was performed in total 236 patients. Results of the treatment in 218 evaluable patients are reported. The first combination included cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, and vincristine (CMFV, 108 patients), the second one carminomycin and dibromodulcitol (CD, 110 patients), both treatments having been administered intermittently. Those patients who became resistant to the first applied schedule or those after five CD cycles, were crossed over to the alternative schedule. Patients were perspectively stratified according to dominant sites of metastases and randomized then to the treatment schedule. Overall response (CR + PR + MR) was achieved in CMFV combination in 35/108 patients (32%), conventional response (CR + PR) in 31/108 patients (29%), complete response (CRP) in 7/108 patients (7%). In CD combination the corresponding values were 34/110 (31%), 27/110 (25%), 1/100 (1%). Response (CR + PR) in patients crossed over from CMFV to CD was seen in 2/37 patients (5%), and from CD to CMFV in 4/36 patients (11%). Median duration of response observed in the CMFV combination was 5.5 months (range 1-12 + months), in the CD combination 4.5 months (range 1-15 months). Toxic reactions were reversible, grade 3 and 4 cardiotoxicity in the CD combination in 4% of patients in the primary treatment and in 14% in patients when crossed over from the primary treatment and in 14% in patients when crossed over from the primary CMFV regimen.",1
Efficacy of BN165 (Ginkor Fort) in breast cancer related upper limb lymphedema: a preliminary study.,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether BN165 (Ginkor Fort), which has been reported to alleviate symptoms of venous insufficiency, has a beneficial effect on lymphatic function or lymphedema symptoms. Using a 3-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled design in 48 patients with upper extremity lymphedema secondary to breast cancer treatment, improvement in symptoms and signs as well as lymphoscintigraphic kinetic parameters (radiocolloid half-life and lymphatic migration speed) was assessed in response to treatment. A statistically significant effect on limb heaviness was noted. Lymphatic migration speed also demonstrated a significant increase at a dose of 2 active capsules per day but not at the 3 capsules per day dose, but lymphatic migration speed also improved in the placebo group. These findings in mechanical lymphatic insufficiency in breast cancer-related lymphedemas can be compared to the previously published clinical amelioration by BN165 of the subjective symptoms (heavy limbs) of dynamic lymphatic insufficiency in patients with venous insufficiency. Further studies are needed to define the possible role of BN165 in treating patients with lymphedema.",0
Dose-response relationship of epirubicin-based first-line chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer: a prospective randomized trial.,"PURPOSE: We compared prospectively the antitumor efficacy of two combination chemotherapy regimens with two different dose levels of epirubicin as first-line treatment for advanced breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred forty-one fully assessable patients were randomized to receive either our intensified schedule (group A, n = 71) of epirubicin 50 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 (every 3 weeks), or a non-intensified program (group B, n = 70) in which epirubicin was only administered on day 1. Both groups also received fluorouracil (5 FU) and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 on day 1 of each course. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference in response rate was observed (69% in group A v 41% in group B, P < .001) for both locally advanced (LA) and recurrent metastatic (RM) disease. Response duration (22 v 14 months, P < .01) and time to progression (TTP; 19 v 8 months, P < .02) were also significantly improved. Overall survival was similar in both groups. However, univariate and/or multivariate analyses showed a meaningful relationship between type of treatment allocated, dose-intensity (DI) of epirubicin, and response rate, as well as between TTP and survival. Ultimately, TTP and survival were also influenced by further treatment modalities, namely, hormonotherapy and chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: This study validates prospectively the concept of a dose-response relationship for an anthracycline-based chemotherapy in previously untreated advanced breast cancer.",1
Treatment of cancer-associated hypercalcemia. Double-blind comparison of rapid and slow intravenous infusion regimens of pamidronate disodium and saline alone.,"BACKGROUND: We assessed the effects of 60-mg single doses of pamidronate disodium compared with saline alone in the treatment of cancer-associated hypercalcemia. METHODS: After pretreatment hydration, patients with corrected serum calcium concentrations of 3.0 mmol/L (12 mg/dL) or greater secondary to cancer were randomized to double-blind treatment with a single infusion of pamidronate disodium, 60 mg, over either 4 or 24 hours or continued infusions of 0.9% saline alone (n = 23 per group). Corrected serum calcium levels were measured daily for 7 days of inpatient evaluation. RESULTS: Response rates for both of the pamidronate regimens were significantly (P < .05) higher than that for saline alone. A complete response to treatment (corrected serum calcium concentration normalized) was observed for five (22%), 18 (78%), and 14 (61%) patients, respectively, who received saline alone, 4-hour infusion of pamidronate, and 24-hour infusion of pamidronate. There were no significant differences between the two pamidronate regimens. Median durations of complete response were 6, 6, and 11 days, respectively, and median times to relapse (includes complete plus partial responders and nonresponders) were 0, 7, and 7 days, respectively. Pamidronate was well tolerated as assessed by all clinical and laboratory measures, regardless of the time of infusion. CONCLUSIONS: A 4-hour infusion of pamidronate disodium, 60 mg, was as safe and effective as a 24-hour infusion, and both were superior to saline alone in lowering corrected serum calcium concentrations in patients with cancer-associated hypercalcemia.",0
Fulvestrant in advanced breast cancer following tamoxifen and aromatase inhibition: a single center experience.,"Fulvestrant is a pure estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist with no agonist effects. We describe the experience of a single center involving 45 postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer where fulvestrant was utilized following progression on tamoxifen and a third generation aromatase inhibitor. Patients received fulvestrant as first line one (2%), second line 18 (40%), third line 13 (29%), fourth line 10 (22%), and fifth line three (7%) treatment. Median duration of treatment with Fulvestrant was 4 months (range 1-20 months). One patient had a partial response, 14 other (31%) experienced clinical benefit (CB) (defined as response or stable disease for at least 6 months). The median time to progression (TTP) from initiation of fulvestrant was 4 months (range 1-20 months) and the median survival was 10 months (range 1-55 months). In those patients who experienced CB the median TTP was 10 months (range 6-20) and median survival was 21 months (range 7-55). Fulvestrant was well tolerated; two patients experienced side effects severe enough to stop therapy. Despite the fact that fulvestrant was used in the majority of cases, later in the treatment sequence CB was seen in a number of patients. This data suggest fulvestrant is well tolerated and is a useful treatment option in patients with advanced breast cancer who progress on prior endocrine treatment.",1
Effectiveness of guaraná (Paullinia cupana) for postradiation fatigue and depression: results of a pilot double-blind randomized study.,"CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Guaraná (Paullinia cupana) has been used medicinally for centuries. The aim of this study is evaluate the effectiveness of guaraná in the treatment of postradiation depression and fatigue. DESIGN AND SETTING: This study had a double-blind randomized design with crossover between experimental arms, at Faculdade de Medicina da Fundação do ABC. METHODS: We conducted a randomized double-blind crossover trial with 36 patients with breast cancer undergoing adjuvant radiation therapy. We randomized patients to either guaraná 75 mg daily p.o. or to placebo. Patients were switched to the other experimental arm at the middle of the radiation treatment, which consisted of 28 daily fractions of 180 cGy. Evaluations were conducted at the beginning, at the middle, and at the end of radiation therapy. RESULTS: We were unable to show any statistically significant differences between the guaraná and the placebo-treated group with any of the measured scores. Also, within the same group, we did not see any statistically significant associations during either the guaraná- or placebo-treated periods with any of the aforementioned measures. CONCLUSIONS: We were unable to show that patients with breast cancer undergoing radiation therapy derive any advantage with guaraná over placebo for both fatigue and depressive symptoms.",0
Value of axillary dissection in addition to lumpectomy and radiotherapy in early breast cancer. The Breast Carcinoma Collaborative Group of the Institut Curie.,"Axillary dissection in early breast cancer remains controversial because of its substantial side-effects and because its value with respect to recurrence or survival has not been unequivocally proven. Between 1982 and 1987, 658 patients were included in a prospective randomised comparison of lumpectomy alone with lumpectomy plus axillary dissection. All patients had a unilateral breast tumour not exceeding 3 cm in diameter and lymph-node involvement or metastases. Radiation therapy was given to both groups. The two groups of patients were similar with respect to mean age, TNM stage, and presence of hormonal receptors. Median follow-up was 54 months. 5-year survival of the patients was 94.2% (95% Cl: 92.1-96.4). There was a significant advantage in survival in the axillary dissection group (p = 0.014). Recurrence of tumour in the breast was similar in the two groups but visceral metastases, supraclavicular metastases, and lymph-node recurrences were less frequent in the axillary dissection group. Survival was related to the age of the patients (p = 0.005), the presence of positive nodes (p = 0.006), the histological grading (p less than 0.0001), and the presence of hormonal receptors (progesterone p = 0.0008, oestrogen p less than 0.0001). Treatment-adjusted relative risk was 2.4 (95% Cl: 1.3-4.2). The findings show that axillary dissection is justified for treatment of small breast cancers, although whether the better survival is due to axillary clearance itself or to adjuvant treatment for lymph-node involvement is unclear.",0
Doxorubicin/pemetrexed followed by docetaxel versus doxorubicin/ cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel as neoadjuvant treatment for early-stage breast cancer: a randomized phase II trial.,"BACKGROUND: Microarray gene expression profiling has indicated that complex molecular gene expression signatures might be predictive of outcome after systemic treatment for early breast cancer. Neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) with its assessment of pathologic complete response (pCR), so far the best surrogate parameter for cure, provides a unique opportunity to rapidly identify such molecular predictors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Currently, an international, randomized phase II study of 2 sequential regimens as NST is being conducted in patients with primary invasive breast cancer T2-4a-c N0-2 M0. Patients receive 4 cycles of doxorubicin/pemetrexed, followed by 4 cycles of docetaxel (AP-Doc) or 4 cycles of doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide, followed by 4 cycles of docetaxel (AC-Doc). Tumor, tissue, blood, and serum are collected at baseline and, if available, after 4 cycles of chemotherapy, and at surgery. The clinical objectives are to assess pCR rate, tumor response, rate of histologically negative axillary lymph nodes, disease-free survival, and safety after NST with AP-Doc or AC-Doc. Translational research objectives include the identification of differentially expressed genes predictive for the achievement of pCR after either treatment regimen. RESULTS: As of January 2007, 178 of the 256 patients planned for this study had been enrolled at 12 European centers. The recommendation after a planned interim safety and efficacy analysis was to continue with the trial as planned. CONCLUSION: We anticipate this study will provide a better understanding of the treatment options with pemetrexed in primary breast cancer and give insight into the practical robustness of the new marker sets in response prediction.",1
Exemestane improves survival in metastatic breast cancer: results of a phase III randomized study.,"We compared the efficacy and safety of the oral aromatase inactivator exemestane (EXE) with megestrol acetate (MA) in women with metastatic breast cancer. This phase III randomized, double-blind, multicenter study was conducted in 769 postmenopausal women who had experienced tamoxifen failure. Treatment arms consisted of EXE 25 mg once daily (n=366) or MA 40 mg four times daily (160 mg daily; n=403). Peer-reviewed, intent-to-treat analyses demonstrated that EXE induced a trend toward higher rates of complete response (CR)+partial response (PR) (15.0% vs. 12.4%) and of CR+PR+stable disease (SD)=24 weeks (37.4% vs. 34.6%), but differences were not statistically significant. Statistically significant differences favoring EXE were seen in median duration of CR+PR+SD=24 weeks (60.1 vs. 49.1 weeks; P=0.025), time to tumor progression (20.3 vs. 16.6 weeks; P=0.037), time to treatment failure (16.3 vs. 15.7 weeks; P=0.042), and overall survival (not reached vs. 123.4 weeks; P=0.039). Both treatments were well tolerated, but MA was associated with more grade 3 or 4 weight gain (8% vs. 17%, P=0.001); the pain score was sim-ilar in both groups. There was a trend toward superiority in treatment-related signs and symptoms (TRSS) with EXE. There was greater improvement in the pain score and TRSS in patients achieving an objective response with EXE vs. MA. Quality of life improved or was similar for EXE in most domains. Exemestane offers an important new treatment option for postmenopausal women with hormone-responsive breast cancer.",1
Neoadjuvant vinorelbine/epirubicin (VE) versus standard adriamycin/cyclophosphamide (AC) in operable breast cancer: analysis of response and tolerability in a randomised phase III trial (TOPIC 2).,"BACKGROUND: Vinorelbine is active and well tolerated against advanced breast cancer but there are no published efficacy studies in early breast cancer. We have therefore carried out a randomised phase III neoadjuvant trial in operable breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with > or =3 cm operable breast carcinoma were randomised to receive either vinorelbine 25 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8 and epirubicin 60 mg/m(2) on day 1, 3 weekly for six cycles (VE) or doxorubicin 60 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) i.v. on day 1, 3 weekly for six cycles (AC), prior to standard local therapy, and adjuvant endocrine therapy as appropriate. RESULTS: A total of 451 patients were randomised. Results for AC and VE, respectively, were: overall clinical response 73% and 74%, complete clinical remission 20% and 24%, pathological complete remission 12% and 12%, mastectomy rate 52% and 55%. None of these differences were significant. Dose reduction was required in 8% for AC and 20% for VE (P <0.001) (GSCF support not used). Significantly more grade 3/4 toxicity for nausea, vomiting and alopecia (despite scalp cooling) was seen for AC compared with VE but significantly less grade 3/4 thrombophlebitis and neuropathy. CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant VE is as effective as AC in early breast cancer and was better tolerated except for thrombophlebitis and neuropathy.",1
Effects of raloxifene on sex steroid hormones and C-telopeptide in postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer.,"Within a multicentric, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II trial, postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer were randomized to either 60 or 600 mg daily of raloxifene or placebo administered for 2 weeks prior to surgery. Circulating levels of sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG), dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEA-S), estrone (E1), estrone-sulfate (E1-S), estradiol (E2), and C-terminal telopeptide (CTX), were determined at baseline and the day before surgery in 37 women enrolled at the European Institute of Oncology in Milan. Raloxifene had a statistically significant different effect compared with placebo on SHBG (p<0.001) and E2 (p=0.03), without any dose-response relationship. Women on raloxifene (n=26) showed an increase from baseline of 10.7% (inter-quartile range: 5.9; 24.2) in SHBG and of 1.3% (inter-quartile range: -8.0; 24.5) in E2, whereas women on placebo (n=11) showed a decrease by 15.5% (inter-quartile range: 7.9; 18.1) and 17.3% (inter-quartile range: 6.5; 40.0), respectively. No significant differences were found on the other variables. A positive correlation was observed between DHEA-S and E1-S (p=0.001) or E2 (p<0.001), while SHBG correlated negatively with E1-S (p=0.024) and E2 (p=0.01), and positively with DHEA-S (p=0.016) and CTX (p=0.040). Our results provide evidence for an early endocrine effect of raloxifene which further suggests a favorable impact on breast cancer prevention.",0
Duration of letrozole treatment and outcomes in the placebo-controlled NCIC CTG MA.17 extended adjuvant therapy trial.,"PURPOSE: MA.17 was a double-blind placebo-controlled trial involving 5187 postmenopausal women that established letrozole to be of value in reducing recurrence of breast cancer when given in the extended adjuvant therapy setting after about 5 years of tamoxifen. Analyses were conducted to examine the relationships between duration of treatment on MA.17 and outcomes. METHODS: The final MA.17 database that included all events up to the date of unblinding of the study was interrogated. A non-parametric kernel smoothing method was used to estimate the hazard rates for disease-free survival (DFS), distant DFS (DDFS) and overall survival (OS) at 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months of follow-up and the hazard ratios (HRs) of letrozole to placebo were determined. The trend in HRs over time was tested based on a Cox model with a time-dependent covariate. RESULTS: Considering all patients, HRs for events in DFS and DDFS progressively decreased over time, favoring letrozole, with the trend being significant (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0013, respectively) whereas the trend for OS was not significant. Considering the 2360 patients with node-positive status, the HRs for DFS, DDFS and OS all decreased over time with tests for trend all showing significance (p = 0.0004, 0.0005 and 0.038, respectively). Considering the 2568 patients with node-negative status, the HRs for DFS decreased over time with the test for trend being significant (p = 0.027) whereas the HRs for DDFS and OS showed no significant change over time. CONCLUSION: These analyses suggest that, at least out to about 48 months, longer duration of letrozole treatment is associated with greater benefit in the extended adjuvant therapy setting.",0
Sleep aid use during and following breast cancer adjuvant chemotherapy.,"BACKGROUND: Knowledge of sleep aid use is limited despite the high prevalence of insomnia among women before, during, and following breast cancer adjuvant chemotherapy treatments (CTX). This study's purpose was to (1) determine the frequency and characteristics of participants taking sleep aid(s); (2) identify the frequency and percentage of sleep aid use by category (prescription sedative/hypnotics, prescription anti-depressants, prescription analgesics, prescription anti-emetics, over-the-counter (OTC) analgesics, OTC cold/flu/sinus, OTC sleep, alcohol, and herbal supplements); and (3) compare sleep aid use by category in the experimental and control groups within a randomized-controlled clinical trial (RCT).METHODS: Longitudinal, descriptive, secondary RCT data analysis of women (n=219) receiving out-patient CTX, and at 30, 60, and 90 days following the last CTX and 1 year following CTX1. Participants recorded daily sleep aid use on a Sleep Diary. Analyses included descriptives, chi-square, and RM-ANOVA.RESULTS: Approximately 20% of participants took at least one sleep aid before CTX1; usage decreased over time (12-18%); a second sleep aid was used infrequently. Prescription sedative/hypnotics (46%) and OTC analgesics (24%) were used most frequently. OTC sleep aids were most commonly used as a second aid. Prescription sedative/hypnotics [F(7,211)=4.26, p=0.00] and OTC analgesics [F(7,211)=2.38, p=0.023] use decreased significantly over time.CONCLUSIONS: Results reflect the natural course of CTX, recovery, and healing. Comprehensive screening for sleep-wake disturbances and sleep aid use may lead to a better understanding of the risks and benefits of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions, and ultimately lead to selection of the safest and most effective treatment.",0
"The ATAC ('Arimidex', Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination) adjuvant breast cancer trial: baseline endometrial sub-protocol data on the effectiveness of transvaginal ultrasonography and diagnostic hysteroscopy.","BACKGROUND: The 'Arimidex', Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination (ATAC) trial is a randomized, double-blind trial comparing anastrozole ('Arimidex'), alone or in combination with tamoxifen, relative to tamoxifen alone as 5 year adjuvant treatment for post-menopausal women with early breast cancer. Since tamoxifen is associated with endometrial pathology, the ATAC endometrial sub-protocol was initiated to establish the background prevalence of intrauterine pathology, and to assess prospectively the incidence and nature of intrauterine changes following endocrine therapy. Another aim was to provide data from which advice could be generated on the best endometrium screening method for patients receiving tamoxifen. METHODS: Patients underwent endometrial assessments at entry to the sub-protocol. The baseline investigations comprised transvaginal ultrasound scanning (TVUS), a hysteroscopy and an endometrial biopsy. RESULTS: A total of 285 gynaecologically asymptomatic women from 31 centres in 10 countries entered the endometrial sub-protocol. The mean uterine volume was 47.7 cm3. The median endometrial thickness overall was 3 mm. Twenty-four histologically confirmed, pathological changes were observed. Twenty-three pathologies were confirmed by TVUS, and 21 were identified by hysteroscopy and confirmed by histopathology. Women with or without intrauterine pathology had median endometrial thickness of 5 and 3 mm respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of pathology was associated with increased endometrial thickness. The relative sensitivity and specificity of hysteroscopy and endometrial thickness for the diagnosis of endometrial pathology was comparable to other studies. If screening of the endometrium prior to treatment is appropriate, this study supports the use of an endometrial thickness of 3 mm, as assessed by TVUS, as a threshold for needing further investigation. This study demonstrates that if the endometrial thickness is >3 mm, hysteroscopy and biopsy is the optimal method of detecting intrauterine pathology in women with breast cancer who are about to commence endocrine treatment.",0
A comparative study of doxorubicin and epirubicin in patients with metastatic breast cancer.,"Seventy-seven patients with progressive metastatic breast cancer refractory to prior therapy participated in a prospective randomized trial designed to compare the efficacy and toxicity of doxorubicin and epirubicin administered as single agents. In arm 1, 60 mg/m2 of doxorubicin and, in arm 2, 90 mg/m2 of epirubicin were administered by 48-h continuous i.v. infusion every 3 weeks. In arm 3, 90 mg/m2 of epirubicin was administered by bolus every 3 weeks. Patients in the three groups had similar characteristics, except that in arm 3 more patients were premenopausal, had more extensive disease, and fewer patients had been exposed to doxorubicin. Objective remission rates were 29, 26, and 13%, respectively for the three arms. Median response durations ranged from 4-6 months. No significant differences occurred in response rate, remission duration, or survival among patients in the three arms. The incidence of gastrointestinal toxicity and alopecia was evenly distributed. Hematologic toxicity was more severe in arms 2 and 3, and there was a higher incidence of infectious complications in arms 2 and 3 compared to arm 1 (p = 0.05). Two episodes of congestive heart failure occurred in arm 1, one in arm 2, and three in arm 3. Although the total cumulative anthracycline dosage was highest in the arm 2 group, they had the lowest incidence of cardiac toxicity. Epirubicin by bolus and doxorubicin administered by continuous infusion have similar potential for cardiac toxicity. Epirubicin administered by continuous infusion appears less cardiotoxic than doxorubicin by either method of administration or epirubicin given by bolus. Epirubicin appears equally active and less cardiotoxic than the parent compound doxorubicin in patients with metastatic breast cancer.",1
Serum homocysteine levels in postmenopausal breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen.,"Adjuvant treatment of breast cancer with tamoxifen may be associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. Serum homocysteine level has been suggested to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease influenced by estrogenic hormones. We evaluated a subset of postmenopausal women who had participated in a longitudinal, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled toxicity study of tamoxifen 10 mg orally, twice daily. Twenty-seven treated subjects and 37 placebo subjects had measurements of serum homocysteine levels made on previously frozen samples obtained at baseline and after 12 months. After treatment with tamoxifen, we found lower levels of serum homocysteine of borderline statistical significance.",0
FGFR4 Arg388 genotype is associated with pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for primary breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the FGFR4 gene is associated with poor prognosis in solid tumors. A recent study presented the first evidence that FGFR4 Arg388 could predict resistance to adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer. The present study evaluates the potential of this SNP to predict response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) for primary breast cancer (PBC). METHODS: As part of a randomized phase II trial, 257 patients received either doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide (AC) or doxorubicin-pemetrexed (AP) followed by docetaxel (Doc; Taxotere) as NCT for T2-4/N0-2/M0 PBC. FGFR4 genotype analyzed on germline DNA was correlated with clinicopathologic variables, clinical response, and pathological complete response (pCR) using univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Only axillary lymph node status was associated with FGFR4 Arg388 [odds ratio (OR) 1.82, P = 0.03]. Joint analysis of both treatment arms revealed a correlation of FGFR4 Arg388 with clinical response (OR 2.14, P = 0.03) but not with pCR. In the AC-Doc arm, however, FGFR4 Arg388 was a strong predictor of pCR in the multivariate analysis (OR 3.79, P = 0.03). A significant interaction between FGFR4 genotype and treatment (P = 0.01) was found, indicating a therapy-specific effect. CONCLUSION: We provide the evidence that FGFR4 388Arg is an independent predictor of pCR following AC-Doc as NCT in PBC.",0
Randomized phase II trial on mitomycin-C/cisplatin +/- KLT in heavily pretreated advanced breast cancer.,"A randomized phase II study using mitomycin (MMC)/cisplatin (DDP) regimen with or without Kanglaite (KLT, a traditional Chinese medicine) as salvage treatment was conducted to exploit KLT's potential effects on patients with advanced breast cancer (ABC). Triweekly regimen consisted of mitomycin (8 mg/m(2)) administered intravenously on day 1, and cisplatin (25 mg/m(2)) intravenously on days 1 to 3. KLT (100 ml) was given intravenously per day on days 1 to 14 every 3 weeks. Between April 2006 and July 2007, 60 patients with a median age of 48 years were randomized into MMC/DDP with or without KLT treatment. In all, the objective response rate (ORR) was 17.5%. There were no significant differences between experimental and control treatments in terms of ORR (14.3% vs. 20.7%, p = 0.730), clinical benefit rates (24.1% vs. 28.6%, p = 0.468), median time to progression (TTP; 3.63 vs. 4.0, p = 0.872), and overall survival (OS; 7.17 vs. not reached, p = 0.120). The median TTP for patients with complete or partial responses was 6.0 months, but only 2.1 months for patients with stable or progressive disease (SD or PD; p = 0.028). While the median OS for patients who obtained clinical benefit from chemotherapy was not reached, that of patients with SD of no more than 6 months or PD was only 7.17 months (p = 0.004). There is no additional benefit when KLT is added to the MMC/DDP doublet in the management of ABC. Patients who obtained clinical benefit from chemotherapy had a longer TTP and OS.",0
Hormonal effects of toremifene in breast cancer patients.,"The effect of toremifene treatment on the serum levels of sex steroids (estradiol, progesterone, testosterone), FSH, LH, prolactin, TSH, T3, T4 and SHBG was investigated. Basal prolactin level and the ""prolactin reserve capacity"" of the hypophysis was also studied by the TRH functional test. Steroid hormone receptors were detected in the patients where a tumor biopsy could be obtained. In a randomized trial patients were treated by 60 and 300 mg of toremifene per os, daily. Hormone levels were assayed prior to treatment and at the 2nd, 6th, 8th and 12th week of tormifene therapy. The hormonal effects of toremifene were the most marked at the 2nd and at the 8th week. Estradiol decreased continuously, SHBG increased slightly and the high initial value of basal prolactin level decreased. The TRH-induced prolactin release was suppressed by tormifene after an 8-week period. No clinical response-related tendency was found.",0
Prognostic and predictive value of centrally reviewed expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors in a randomized trial comparing letrozole and tamoxifen adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal early breast cancer: BIG 1-98.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate locally versus centrally assessed estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PgR) receptor status and the impact of PgR on letrozole adjuvant therapy compared with tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Breast International Group (BIG) 1-98 randomly assigned 8,010 patients to four arms comparing letrozole and tamoxifen with sequences of each agent. The Central Pathology Office received material for 6,549 patients (82%), of which 79% were assessable (6,291 patients). Prognostic and predictive value of both local and central hormone receptor expression on disease-free survival (DFS) were evaluated among 3,650 assessable patients assigned to the monotherapy arms. Prognostic value and the treatment effect were estimated for centrally assessed ER and PgR expression levels using the Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plot. RESULTS: Central review confirmed 97% of tumors as hormone receptor-positive (ER and/or PgR > or =10%). Of 105 tumors locally ER-negative, 73 were found to have more than 10% positive cells, and eight had 1% to 9%. Of 6,100 tumors locally ER positive, 66 were found to have no staining, and 54 had only 1% to 9%. Discordance was more marked for PgR than ER. Patients with tumors reclassified centrally as ER-negative, or as hormone receptor-negative, had poor DFS. Centrally assessed ER and PgR showed prognostic value. Among patients with centrally assessed ER-expressing tumors, letrozole showed better DFS than tamoxifen, irrespective of PgR expression level. CONCLUSION: Central review changed the assessment of receptor status in a substantial proportion of patients, and should be performed whenever possible in similar trials. PgR expression did not affect the relative efficacy of letrozole over tamoxifen.",0

A randomized trial of low-dose tamoxifen on breast cancer proliferation and blood estrogenic biomarkers.,"BACKGROUND: Tamoxifen reduces the risk of breast cancer in women at high risk for the disease but increases the risk for endometrial tumors and venous thromboembolisms, possibly in a dose-dependent fashion. We compared the effects of tamoxifen at 1 mg/day and 5 mg/day with those of the standard dose of 20 mg/day on breast cancer proliferation using a surrogate endpoint marker (Ki-67 expression) and blood biomarkers associated with breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and bone fracture risk. METHODS: We randomly assigned 120 women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer to tamoxifen at 1, 5, or 20 mg/day for 4 weeks. Expression of the tumor proliferation marker Ki-67 and of biomarkers of breast cancer (insulin-like growth factor-I, sex hormone-binding globulin), cardiovascular disease (cholesterol, triglycerides, ultrasensitive C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, antithrombin-III), and bone fracture (type I collagen C-telopeptide) risk were determined before (baseline) and after treatment. All levels were compared with those in two nonrandomized control groups (34 women with ER-negative breast cancer and 29 additional women with ER-positive breast cancer). Data were analyzed by analysis of covariance. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Expression of Ki-67 decreased in all three tamoxifen groups, with no difference in the magnitude of reduction among groups (P =.81). Relative to baseline, Ki-67 expression decreased by a median of 15.0% (95% confidence interval = 0.0% to 24.1%) among the tamoxifen groups but increased by 12.8% (95% confidence interval = 0.0% to 19.6%) among the nonrandomized control groups. Several blood biomarkers showed dose-response relationships with tamoxifen, including decreased insulin-like growth factor-I, increased sex hormone-binding globulin, and decreased low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, ultrasensitive C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and antithrombin-III levels. CONCLUSIONS: The effects on Ki-67 expression of lower doses of tamoxifen were comparable to those achieved with the standard dose, although the effects on blood biomarkers were variable. The effects of lower doses of tamoxifen should be assessed further in randomized trials.",1
Cytogenetic outcomes of adjuvant chemotherapy in non-target cells of breast cancer patients.,"Spontaneous and chemotherapy-induced sister chromatid exchanges (SCES) and lymphocyte proliferation rate index (PRI) in cultured peripheral lymphocytes were evaluated in 30 patients with diagnosed breast cancer before and after adjuvant chemotherapy and in 30 healthy women with no known familial history of breast cancer. Before chemotherapy, the breast cancer patients had a significantly increased background level of SCE, and lowered PRI as compared with the healthy women. Marked inter-individual variations were observed in both endpoints among the patients. Significantly elevated frequency of SCE and depressed PRI were recorded in blood samples collected after the first cycle of chemotherapy, with high inter-individual variations in the responses to the chemotherapy. FAC (5-fluorouracil, adriamycin and cyclophosphamide) protocol was the most genotoxic of the protocols studied, but also AC (adriamycin, cyclophosphamide) and CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil) clearly increased SCE. All protocols significantly retarded lymphocyte proliferation in vitro. Our findings indicate that both SCE and PRI may serve as sensitive biomarkers for the routine detection of critical lesions produced by the administration of antineoplastic drugs in the clinical setting, as well as for possible screening of high-risk individuals among patients who have successfully completed chemotherapy.",0
Endometrial cancer in tamoxifen-treated breast cancer patients: findings from the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-14.,"BACKGROUND: Tamoxifen is advantageous in treating all stages of breast cancer. However, studies have suggested that incidence and severity of endometrial cancer increase in women treated with tamoxifen. PURPOSE: We compared rates of endometrial and other cancers in tamoxifen- and non-tamoxifen-treated patients and described the pathologic characteristics of the endometrial cancers. METHODS: Data were analyzed on 2843 patients with node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive, invasive breast cancer randomly assigned to placebo or tamoxifen (20 mg/d) and on 1220 tamoxifen-treated patients registered in NSABP B-14 subsequent to randomization. Average time on study is 8 years for randomly assigned patients and 5 years for registered patients. RESULTS: The incidence rates of liver, gastrointestinal, urinary tract, and nonuterine genital tumors were not increased by tamoxifen treatment. Twenty-five endometrial cancers were originally reported, one of which was reclassified after subsequent review. Two cases occurred in the placebo group in patients whose medical status subsequent to random assignment had required tamoxifen treatment. Twenty-three occurred in the tamoxifen groups. Twenty-one of the 24 originally reported endometrial cancers were FIGO stage 1; 18 of 23 gradable cases were of good to moderate histologic grade. Four tamoxifen-treated women died of uterine cancer. The average annual hazard rate of endometrial cancer as a first event within the first 5 years of follow-up in the randomized, tamoxifen-treated group was 1.2/1000 patient-years; the cumulative hazard rate was 6.3/1000. Findings for the registered, tamoxifen-treated group were similar. Including all originally reported endometrial cancers, the annual hazard rate through all follow-up was 0.2/1000 in the placebo group and 1.6/1000 in the randomized, tamoxifen-treated group; the relative risk of endometrial cancer for the latter versus the former group was 7.5. Again for the latter group, using population-based rates of endometrial cancer from SEER data and information from another NSABP (B-06) trial, relative risks were 2.2 and 2.3, respectively. The 5-year cumulative hazard rate for disease-free survival in the randomized tamoxifen group was 38% less than that in the placebo group. Some data in this paper were provided by an investigator who submitted fraudulent data to the NSABP [see the ""News"" section]; therefore, the reader must read the entire text including Table 10 and the Editor's notes. In brief, data on 182 of the 2843 randomly assigned patients and 37 of the 1220 registered patients were provided by the investigator in question. After review, 24 of the 182 records showed falsification, all involving characteristics of patients prior to random assignment. Of the 37 registered-patient records, 8 showed falsification. CONCLUSIONS: Risk of endometrial cancer increases following tamoxifen therapy for invasive breast cancer; however, net benefit greatly outweighs risk. Endometrial cancers occurring after tamoxifen therapy do not appear to be of a different type with a worse prognosis than are such tumors in non-tamoxifen-treated patients. IMPLICATIONS: Tamoxifen treatment for breast cancer should continue. In addition, the relative risk of endometrial cancer observed in B-14 tamoxifen-treated patients is consistent with the twofold relative risk used in the initial risk-benefit computation for the NSABP breast cancer prevention trial.",0
Radiation-induced brachial plexopathy: neurological follow-up in 161 recurrence-free breast cancer patients.,"PURPOSE: The purpose was to assess the incidence and clinical manifestations of radiation-induced brachial plexopathy in breast cancer patients, treated according to the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group protocols. METHODS AND MATERIALS: One hundred and sixty-one recurrence-free breast cancer patients were examined for radiation-induced brachial plexopathy after a median follow-up period of 50 months (13-99 months). After total mastectomy and axillary node sampling, high-risk patients were randomized to adjuvant therapy. One hundred twenty-eight patients were treated with postoperative radiotherapy with 50 Gy in 25 daily fractions over 5 weeks. In addition, 82 of these patients received cytotoxic therapy (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil) and 46 received tamoxifen. RESULTS: Five percent and 9% of the patients receiving radiotherapy had disabling and mild radiation-induced brachial plexopathy, respectively. Radiation-induced brachial plexopathy was more frequent in patients receiving cytotoxic therapy (p = 0.04) and in younger patients (p = 0.04). The clinical manifestations were paraesthesia (100%), hypaesthesia (74%), weakness (58%), decreased muscle stretch reflexes (47%), and pain (47%). CONCLUSION: The brachial plexus is more vulnerable to large fraction size. Fractions of 2 Gy or less are advisable. Cytotoxic therapy adds to the damaging effect of radiotherapy. Peripheral nerves in younger patients seems more vulnerable. Radiation-induced brachial plexopathy occurs mainly as diffuse damage to the brachial plexus.",0
"Effects on quality of life, anti-cancer responses, breast conserving surgery and survival with neoadjuvant docetaxel: a randomised study of sequential weekly versus three-weekly docetaxel following neoadjuvant doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide in women with primary breast cancer.","BACKGROUND: Weekly docetaxel has occasionally been used in the neoadjuvant to downstage breast cancer to reduce toxicity and possibly enhance quality of life. However, no studies have compared the standard three weekly regimen to the weekly regimen in terms of quality of life. The primary aim of our study was to compare the effects on QoL of weekly versus 3-weekly sequential neoadjuvant docetaxel. Secondary aims were to determine the clinical and pathological responses, incidence of Breast Conserving Surgery (BCS), Disease Free Survival (DFS) and Overall Survival (OS). METHODS: Eighty-nine patients receiving four cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide were randomised to receive twelve cycles of weekly docetaxel (33 mg/m2) or four cycles of 3-weekly docetaxel (100 mg/m2). The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast and psychosocial questionnaires were completed. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 71.5 months, there was no difference in the Trial Outcome Index scores between treatment groups. During weekly docetaxel, patients experienced less constipation, nail problems, neuropathy, tiredness, distress, depressed mood, and unhappiness. There were no differences in overall clinical response (93% vs. 90%), pathological complete response (20% vs. 27%), and breast-conserving surgery (BCS) rates (49% vs. 42%). Disease-free survival and overall survival were similar between treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Weekly docetaxel is well-tolerated and has less distressing side-effects, without compromising therapeutic responses, Breast Conserving Surgery (BCS) or survival outcomes in the neoadjuvant setting. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN: ISRCTN09184069.",0
Reduction in new metastases in breast cancer with adjuvant clodronate treatment.,"BACKGROUND: Bisphosphonates are effective against the increased bone resorption caused by certain diseases because they inhibit the activity of osteoclasts. In patients who have breast cancer and metastatic bone disease, the bisphosphonate clodronate (clodronic acid) reduces the frequency of skeletal complications. Experiments in animals and preliminary clinical observations indicate that early clodronate therapy reduces the incidence of new bony metastases in breast cancer. We investigated the effects of clodronate on the incidence and extent of new metastases in patients with breast cancer. METHODS: Between 1990 and 1995, 302 patients with primary breast cancer and tumor cells in the bone marrow (the presence of which is a risk factor for the development of distant metastases) were randomly assigned to receive clodronate at a dose of 1600 mg per day orally for two years (157 patients) or standard follow-up (145 patients). The median length of observation was 36 months. All patients in both groups received standard surgical treatment and customary hormonal therapy or chemotherapy. RESULTS: Distant metastases were detected in 21 patients in the clodronate group and in 42 patients in the control group (P<0.001). The incidence of both osseous and visceral metastases was significantly lower in the clodronate group than in the control group (P=0.003 for both osseous and visceral metastases). Six patients in the clodronate group died, as did 22 in the control group (P=0.001). The mean number of bony metastases per patient in the clodronate group was roughly half that in the control group (3.1 vs. 6.3). CONCLUSIONS: Clodronate can reduce the incidence and number of new bony and visceral metastases in women with breast cancer who are at high risk for distant metastases.",0
Preoperative gefitinib versus gefitinib and anastrozole in postmenopausal patients with oestrogen-receptor positive and epidermal-growth-factor-receptor-positive primary breast cancer: a double-blind placebo-controlled phase II randomised trial.,"BACKGROUND: Some oestrogen-receptor (ER) positive breast cancers express epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), but whether inhibition of EGFR can suppress proliferation of breast cancer cells and ER function is not known. METHODS: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial of 56 postmenopausal patients with ER-positive and EGFR-positive primary breast cancer, 27 women were randomly assigned to the tyrosine-kinase inhibitor of EGFR gefitinib (250 mg given orally once a day) and the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole (1 mg given orally once a day), and 29 women to gefitinib (250 mg given orally once a day) and placebo of identical appearance to anastrozole given orally once a day, all given for 4-6 weeks before surgery. Primary outcome was inhibition of tumour-cell proliferation, as measured by Ki67 antigen labelling index. Secondary outcomes were reduction in EGFR phosphorylation at Tyr 845, reduction in ER phosphorylation at Ser 118, tumour size, and toxic effects. Analyses were by intention to treat. FINDINGS: Patients assigned gefitinib and anastrozole had a greater reduction from pretreatment values in proliferation-related Ki67 labelling index than did those assigned gefitinib alone (mean % reduction 98.0 [95% CI 96.1-98.9] vs 92.4 [85.1-96.1]; difference between groups 5.6% [5.1-6.0], p=0.0054). Tumour size was reduced by 30-99% (partial response) in 14 of 28 patients assigned gefitinib and [corrected]in 12 of 22 assigned gefitinib, as assessed by ultrasonography. Reduction in phosphorylation of ER at Ser 118 was similar for both groups. Treatment was well tolerated and much the same for both groups. INTERPRETATION: Single-agent gefitinib and gefitinib combined with anastrozole are well-tolerated and effective treatments for reducing the size of breast tumours and levels of ER phosphorylation when given as neoadjuvant therapy.",1
An on-site audit of the South African trial of high-dose chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer and associated publications.,"PURPOSE: The randomized study reported by Bezwoda et al of high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) for treatment of metastatic breast cancer was audited on site to verify the study results. Additional published studies were reviewed to determine whether they had been subject to the required institutional oversight. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety patients were reported to have been randomized and treated on this trial. A log of the names, hospital numbers, entry dates, and regimen received had been provided by the principal investigator. A search of more than 15,000 sets of medical records available from two Johannesburg hospitals was performed to locate records for as many of these 90 patients as possible. Standard auditing techniques were used. Additional clinical trials published by Bezwoda were compared against the minutes of the University of the Witwatersrand Committee for Research on Human Subjects to verify review and approval. RESULTS: Records for only 61 of the 90 patients could be found. Of these 61, only 27 had sufficient records to verify eligibility for the trial by the published criteria. Of these 27, 18 did not meet one or more eligibility criteria. Only 25 patients appeared to have received their assigned therapy temporally associated with their enrollment date, and all but three of these 25 received HDC. The treatment details of individual patients were at great variance from the published data. Nine other trials reported by Bezwoda were not reviewed or approved by the appropriate institutional committee despite statements to the contrary in the publications. CONCLUSION: The multiple publications of this study do not report verifiable data, and nine other publications coauthored by the principal investigator contain at least one major untrue statement.",0
Natural cytotoxicity in breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy: effects of L-arginine supplementation.,"Certain cytotoxic drugs have been shown to suppress host anti-cancer defence mechanisms. The amino acid L-arginine can significantly enhance natural killer (NK) and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell cytotoxicity in patients with locally advanced breast cancer. In this study, the effect of L-arginine supplementation on natural cytotoxicity was determined in patients with breast cancer receiving CHOP chemotherapy. This cytotoxic regimen caused a transient immunosuppression, maximal on day 14 of each cycle (P < 0.001); this was not cumulative during the four cycles of treatment. Those patients receiving L-arginine supplementation (30 g/day for 3 days prior to each course of chemotherapy) had a smaller and delayed onset of immunosuppression (day 14), compared with those patients who had CHOP only (day 9). L-Arginine was able to repeatedly stimulate NK and LAK cell cytotoxicity in patients who were receiving CHOP chemotherapy (P < 0.003). In conclusion, further studies are required to determine the optimal use of chemotherapeutic agents, alone or in combination with immunostimulators, to avoid inhibition of host anti-cancer defence mechanisms.",0
Cyclic sequential endocrine therapy for advanced breast cancer using a combination of tamoxifen and megestrol acetate.,"A cyclical, sequential combination of tamoxifen and megestrol acetate (group B) was compared with conventional therapy (tamoxifen alone, group A) in 261 breast cancer patients. There was no statistically significant difference between groups for overall response rate (complete+partial response: group A, 35.8%, group B, 40.8%; p = 0.505) or for median response duration in responders (group A, 128 weeks, group B, 136 weeks; p = 0.488). Median survival from randomization was longer in those patients receiving sequential therapy (group A, 90 weeks, group B, 134 weeks) with a significantly lower relative death rate (group B/group A = 0.67; p = 0.011). This survival benefit appears to be due to a delay in progression among nonresponders in the sequential therapy group.",1
Influence of progestins on serum hormone levels in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer--II. A differential effect of megestrol acetate and medroxyprogesterone acetate on serum estrone sulfate and sex hormone binding globulin.,"Serum estradiol, estrone, estrone sulfate and sex hormone binding globulin were measured in 10 postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer receiving sequential treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate and megestrol acetate. Treatment with megestrol acetate caused a non-significant reduction in serum estradiol (mean reduction of 19%, 0.05 less than P less than 0.1) but significant reductions in serum estrone (mean reduction of 20%, P less than 0.02) and serum estrone sulfate (mean reduction of 54%, P less than 0.005) compared to treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate. In contrast, treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate reduced serum sex hormone binding globulin more compared to treatment with megestrol acetate (mean reduction of 69%, P less than 0.01). These findings suggest that the two progestins have differential effects on serum hormone levels. The finding that treatment with megestrol acetate causes a significant reduction in serum estrone sulfate level warrants further investigations of this potentially important mechanism of action of this drug in advanced breast cancer.",0
Adjuvant therapy of breast cancer with or without additional treatment with alternate drugs.,"Three hundred ten patients with Stage II or Stage III breast cancer were entered on an adjuvant protocol consisting of a combination of 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (FACVP). In the second phase of the study, patients with estrogen receptor-negative tumors received sequential courses of methotrexate and vinblastine. Other patients, who were estrogen receptor-positive or unknown, were randomized to receive either tamoxifen alone or tamoxifen plus methotrexate and vinblastine. All therapy was completed within 1 year. The estimated disease-free rate at 5 years was 68% among patients with Stage II disease and 52% for patients who had Stage III disease. Among patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors, disease-free survival was significantly prolonged in patients who received methotrexate and vinblastine in addition to tamoxifen (P = 0.04). However, this difference was less pronounced when all randomized patients (including those whose estrogen receptor status was unknown) were included in the comparison. Although most patients experienced moderate to severe granulocytopenia, infectious complications were infrequent. One patient died of septicemia. Congestive heart failure developed in two patients, one of whom had a history of myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure.",1
Repeated significance tests on accumulating survival data.,The aim of the study was to compare the properties of two well-known group sequential methods and to demonstrate the effect of performing interim analyses on accumulating survival data without making appropriate adjustments of the nominal significance level. The properties of a group sequential method with fixed nominal significance level (Pocock stopping boundaries) and a method with increasing nominal level with each interim analysis (O'Brien-Fleming boundaries) were compared by stochastic simulation. Simulation experiments with survival times sampled from a breast cancer trial and from exponential distributions were performed. The true overall significance level with unplanned interim analyses increased from 5% to 14% when a maximum of five tests were performed. Both group sequential methods maintained the desired overall significance level. The O'Brien-Fleming method had higher power than Pocock's method. It also reduced the risk of early stopping based on immature data and should usually be preferred.,0
"A multicentre, randomized, pharmacokinetic, endocrine and clinical study to evaluate formestane in breast cancer patients at first relapse: endocrine and clinical results. The Italian Trials in Medical Oncology (I.T.M.O.) group.","BACKGROUND: In postmenopausal breast cancer (BC) patients, tamoxifen (TAM) is frequently used in first-line therapy, and for those relapsing under TAM, aromatase inhibitors would be the drug of choice. Formestane, a new aromatase inhibitor, has been demonstrated to be as effective as TAM in first-line therapy. This trial was carried out to investigate the pharmacokinetics and antitumor activity of two formestane doses in BC patients at first relapse, as well as their effects on estrogen levels, evaluated by means of a new analytical method. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred fifty-two postmenopausal BC patients were randomly given formestane 250 mg or 500 mg intramuscularly every two weeks. The blood samples for estrogen measurements were taken on the first day of therapy, at 4 and 10 weeks, and every 12 weeks thereafter. Tumor response was first evaluated after 2.5 months, and then every three months. RESULTS: Seventy-three patients received formestane 250 mg and 79 received 500 mg. After four weeks, plasma estrone, estradiol and estrone sulphate levels were significantly (P < 0.001) suppressed in both groups. The overall response rates were 30% and 40% on 250 mg and 500 mg, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Both of the formestane doses are effective in reducing plasma estrogen levels in BC patients at first relapse, and the new analytical method improved the quality of results. The antitumor response was highly satisfactory.",1
Adjuvant CMF in breast cancer: comparative 5-year results of 12 versus 6 cycles.,"We report the 5-yr results of a prospective randomized study comparing 12 versus 6 cycles of CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil) with the aim to evaluate the possibility of reducing the duration of adjuvant treatment without compromising the therapeutic effect of the multimodal approach. At 5-yr from mastectomy, both relapse-free survival (CMF 12: 59%; CMF 6: 65.6%) and total survival (CMF 12: 72.7%; CMF 6: 76.9%) were not significantly different in the two treatment groups. Within the two series, no difference was detected between pre- and postmenopausal patients (CMF 12: 59.3% versus 57.6%; CMF 6: 66.5% versus 63.1%), while findings were inversely related to the number of involved axillary nodes. The analysis of relapse-free survival confirmed that in both menopausal groups, relapse-free survival was not significantly affected by estrogen receptor status. Acute toxic manifestations were moderate and reversible. In particular, no drug-induced leukemia nor increased incidence of solid tumors other than breast cancer were documented in this series. Present results after 12 CMF cycles are almost identical to those of our first CMF adjuvant study. Current findings are sufficiently mature to indicate that the maximum tumor cytoreduction with CMF occurs within a relatively short period of time. To improve the results achieved with a single multidrug regimen, more intensive forms of treatment, i.e., utilizing non-cross-resistant combinations, warrant careful evaluation.",1
Adriamycin alone or combined with vincristine in the treatment of advanced breast cancer.,"One hundred and nineteen women with advanced breast cancer treated previously by endocrine therapy but no prior chemotherapy were given adriamycin 70 mg/m2 i.v. on day 1 of a 3-weekly cycle for 8 courses, followed by a regimen of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) until relapse. They were allocated randomly to receive either no treatment (group A) or vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 i.v. on days 1 and 8 during treatment with adriamycin (group AV). In 107 evaluable patients objective responses were seen in 30/53 patients (57%) in group A and in 28/54 patients (52%) in group AV. The projected dose of adriamycin received was 78% in group A and 75% in group AV; and 60% for vincristine in group AV. The subjective and haematological toxicity for adriamycin was similar in both groups, but 65% of patients treated with vincristine developed neurotoxicity. The median duration of objective regressions was the same for both groups (7 months), and the median time to failure was 5 months for group A and 6 months for group AV respectively. The median survival of the responders tended to be longer in group AV (17.5 months) than in group A (13 months), but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.112). It is concluded that there is no advantage therapeutically in combining vincristine and adriamycin in patients with advanced breast cancer.",1
Amenorrhea in premenopausal women on the doxorubicin-and-cyclophosphamide-followed-by-docetaxel arm of NSABP B-30 trial.,"The NSABP B-30 trial addresses whether amenorrhea after adjuvant chemotherapy increases survival. Preliminary to the trial outcome analysis, we examined the incidence of amenorrhea and its relationship to symptoms and quality of life (QOL) in the standard-care arm of this adjuvant breast cancer trial. Premenopausal women treated on the doxorubicin-and-cyclophosphamide-followed-by-docetaxel arm were included. Questionnaires assessing menstrual history, QOL, and symptoms were administered at baseline, day 1 of cycle 4 (or 9 weeks from start of chemotherapy for those who stopped chemotherapy early), and at 6, 12, and 24 months. Seven hundred and eight patients were evaluable for the analysis, with median potential follow-up of 57.5 months. Of these, 321 patients also participated in the QOL substudy. Of the 708 patients, 83% reported > or =1 episode of amenorrhea for > or =6 months. The estimated rate of resumption of menses at 24 months was 45.3% for women <40 years, 10.9% for women 40-50, and 3.2% for women >50 years. Those treated with tamoxifen were more likely to become amenorrheic (p = 0.003). Menstrual status was not significantly associated with QOL or symptoms. Prolonged amenorrhea is associated with a regimen that contains doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and docetaxel, and is age dependent and impacted by tamoxifen use. Vasomotor symptoms are common in this patient population but are not associated with menstrual status. These results can be used to inform premenopausal women about the risk and time course of amenorrhea associated with this common adjuvant therapy regimen, along with the effects on symptoms and QOL.",0
"Pharmacokinetics of anastrozole and tamoxifen alone, and in combination, during adjuvant endocrine therapy for early breast cancer in postmenopausal women: a sub-protocol of the 'Arimidex and tamoxifen alone or in combination' (ATAC) trial.","The ATAC trial evaluates in a randomized, double-blind design, Arimidextrade mark (anastrozole) alone or in combination with tamoxifen, relative to tamoxifen alone as 5-year adjuvant treatment in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer. Patients included in the pharmacokinetic (PK) sub-protocol had been in ATAC for > or =3 months, taking their medication in the morning and were 100% compliant for the preceding 14 days. Blood samples were collected 24 +/- 4 h after last dose. Trough (C(min)) plasma concentrations of anastrozole, tamoxifen and desmethyltamoxifen (DMT) were measured by validated methods. The PK results were based on a total of 347 patients (131 anastrozole (1 mg o.d.), 111 tamoxifen (20 mg o.d.), 105 anastrozole and tamoxifen (1 and 20 mg o.d. respectively)). The geometric mean steady-state trough plasma concentrations of tamoxifen and DMT were statistically equivalent in patients receiving tamoxifen alone or in combination with anastrozole: geometric mean tamoxifen = 94.8 ng ml(-1)and 95.3 ng ml(-1)in tamoxifen alone and combination groups, respectively; geometric mean DMT = 265.1 and 277.6 ng ml(-1)in the tamoxifen and anastrozole and tamoxifen groups, respectively. The geometric mean anastrozole levels were 27% lower (90% Cl 20-33%;P< 0.001) in the presence of tamoxifen than with anastrozole alone. Baseline plasma oestradiol levels were not obtained in the PK sub-protocol, however, such information was available from a similar ATAC sub-protocol, which evaluated bone mineral density. Mean oestradiol levels were 21.3, 19.3, and 21.6 pmol l(-1)prior to treatment and 3.7, 20.9 and 3.6 pmol l(-1)after 3 months in the anastrozole, tamoxifen, and combination groups, respectively (n = 167). On-treatment values were below the detection limit (3 pmol l(-1)) in 43.6 and 38.5% of the anastrozole alone and anastrozole in combination with tamoxifen groups, respectively. As a result of (a) the lack of effect of anastrozole on tamoxifen and DMT levels and (b) the observed fall in blood anastrozole levels having no significant effect on oestradiol suppression by anastrozole, we conclude that the observed reduction in anastrozole levels by tamoxifen is unlikely to be of clinical significance when anastrozole and tamoxifen are administered together.",0
Predicting mood disorders in breast cancer patients.,"Prediction of delayed psychiatric disorders in breast cancer patients by using a screening procedure was investigated. Two questionnaires, the Psychological Distress Inventory and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, were administered before and during chemotherapy, and at the first follow-up visit. A psychiatric diagnosis was assigned to 50 of the 132 patients (38%) evaluated at follow-up. Including a set of clinical and demographic variables in a logistic regression, increasing age (P=0.001) and psychiatric history (P<0.001) were associated with psychiatric morbidity at follow-up. The accuracy of the two questionnaires in predicting delayed psychiatric disorders increased from the evaluation before chemotherapy to the evaluation during chemotherapy. The most accurate prediction was observed for the concurrent evaluation at follow-up. The accuracy of three predictive models developed for each evaluation point by including age, psychiatric history and psychological distress measured with each of the two questionnaires was not significantly better than that observed using only the questionnaires' scores as predictors.",0
"Randomized trial of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil with or without estrogenic recruitment in women with metastatic breast cancer.","BACKGROUND: The fraction of breast cancer cells undergoing DNA synthesis at any one time is relatively low, which is problematic because most chemotherapeutic agents are most effective against dividing cells. Estrogens administered in vitro and in vivo can increase breast cancer cell proliferation. A randomized clinical trial was performed to determine if estrogenic recruitment could increase the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy. METHODS: One hundred sixty-five women were randomized, with two excluded from these analyses, to either an intravenous cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) regimen alone (cyclophosphamide, 600 mg/m2; methotrexate, 40 mg/m2; 5-fluorouracil, 600 mg/m2) or CMF preceded by 3 days of diethylstilbestrol (DES) at a dose of 1 mg orally per day. The planned cycle length was 3 weeks. RESULTS: Objective responses were seen in 20 of 80 patients (25%) treated with CMF and 32 of 83 patients (39%) treated with DES-CMF, and this difference almost achieved statistical significance (chi-square, two-sided P = 0.06). However, duration of response, time to disease progression, and survival time were similar for the two regimens. CONCLUSIONS: Estrogenic recruitment with DES as used in this study does not substantially increase the efficacy of a CMF regimen administered intravenously every 3 weeks.",0
A randomized clinical trial to investigate the usefulness of the addition of prednisolone to tamoxifen as adjuvants to mastectomy in primary breast cancer patients with a high risk of recurrence: a preliminary report.,"The efficacy of the addition of prednisolone to tamoxifen as adjuvants to mastectomy in patients with primary breast cancer who were at a high risk of recurrence was investigated in a randomized trial. Primary carcinomas were collected from a series of 169 patients with loco-regional disease, undergoing mastectomy. The activities of alpha-glycerolphosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase in the carcinomas were estimated biochemically and the ratio of the two enzymes was used to as the parameter to determine the risk of recurrence. 116 patients with a high risk of recurrence within five years of mastectomy were then randomized to either tamoxifen (2x20 mg/day) or tamoxifen+prednisolone (3x2.5 mg/per day) until recurrence. The patients are currently followed quarterly. The data were analysed at a median follow-up of 26 months (range 7-62 months). The probabilities of both disease-free and overall survival were not significantly different in either arm of the trial, indicating that there is no advantage in combining prednisolone with the antioestrogen. Recently, similar findings in terms of response have been reported for patients with metastatic disease treated with the same combination, raising doubts over the role of prednisolone in the management of patients with endocrine treatments.",0
Ten-year results of a randomized trial evaluating prolonged low-dose adjuvant chemotherapy in node-positive breast cancer: a joint European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Dutch Breast Cancer Working Party Study. Cooperating Investigators.,"PURPOSE: To investigate whether treatment with prolonged low-dose adjuvant chemotherapy could improve survival of patients with axillary node-positive breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred fifty-two patients with axillary node-positive breast cancer who received postoperative irradiation were prospectively randomized in a trial (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC] 09771) that compared surgery followed by prolonged low-dose chemotherapy versus surgery alone. Chemotherapy was given for a period of 2 years and consisted of monthly courses of cyclophosphamide 50 mg/m2 orally on days 1 to 14, methotrexate 15 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1 and 8, and fluorouracil 350 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1 and 8 (CMF). RESULTS: At a median follow-up time of 10 years, the overall survival duration was significantly prolonged in the chemotherapy arm (hazards ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.56 to 0.99; P = .04). Ten-year overall survival rates (+/- SE) were 59% (+/- 3.6%) for the chemotherapy arm and 50% (+/- 3.7%) for the control arm. Time to local relapse was significantly prolonged in the chemotherapy arm (hazards ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.42 to 0.94; P = .02). Patients with one to three positive axillary nodes and patients with estrogen receptor-negative tumors especially benefited from chemotherapy. Toxicity was observed in 93% of patients. CONCLUSION: We conclude that prolonged low-dose adjuvant CMF can significantly prolong overall survival in patients with node-positive breast cancer. However, considering the fact that toxicity was still considerable despite reducing the dose of chemotherapy by 50%, we believe that conventionally dosed short-term regimens are preferable in the treatment of node-positive breast cancer.",0
Cyclical use of tamoxifen and high-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate in advanced estrogen receptor positive breast cancer.,"One-hundred and seventy patients with estrogen receptor positive (greater than or equal to 10 pmol/g protein) advanced breast cancer have been treated in a prospective randomized study either with continuous tamoxifen 30 mg x 1 daily (TAM), or with TAM 30 mg x 1 daily for 8 weeks alternating with medroxyprogesterone acetate 500 mg x 2 daily for 8 weeks (TAM/HD-MPA). The response rate was 62% in the group treated with cyclic TAM/HD-MPA versus 41% in the TAM alone group (p = 0.02). There was no significant difference in duration of remissions or survival.",1
The prolonged postoperative analgesic effect when dexamethasone is added to a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (rofecoxib) before breast surgery.,"BACKGROUND: Glucocorticoids provide analgesia. In this study, we evaluated the effects of adding dexamethasone to a multimodal postoperative analgesic regimen, including a long-acting nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug. METHODS: One-hundred patients admitted for ambulatory breast cancer surgery were studied. They received paracetamol 2 g and rofecoxib 50 mg orally 1 h before start of general anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil. The patients were then randomized to receive, in a double-blind manner, either dexamethasone 16 mg IV or placebo. Both groups received fentanyl 1 mug/kg IV and 20-40 mL bupivacaine 2.5 mg/mL wound infiltration before the end of surgery. RESULTS: There was no difference in pain scores or rescue medication between the groups during the first 4 h after surgery. After discharge, the median pain score during coughing or shoulder movement was 3 on a 0-10 scale in patients receiving placebo, and 1 in the patients receiving dexamethasone, which did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.06). From 24 to 72 h, the median pain with coughing or shoulder movement in patients receiving placebo was 2, and 1 in patients receiving dexamethasone, which did reach statistical significance (P < 0.05). Forty percent of patients receiving dexamethasone were pain free from 4 to 24 h, compared with 24% of patients receiving placebo, a difference that did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.09). Similarly, 46% of patients receiving dexamethasone were pain free from 24 to 72 h, compared with 28% of patients receiving placebo (P = 0.06). More patients had slept poorly on the first night in the dexamethasone group than in the control group, 68% vs 44%, (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Dexamethasone 16 mg provides prolonged postoperative analgesia from 24 to 72 h after surgery when added to a multimodal regimen including nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (rofecoxib).",0
Trastuzumab for patients with axillary-node-positive breast cancer: results of the FNCLCC-PACS 04 trial.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of trastuzumab in patients with node-positive breast cancer treated with surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormone therapy if applicable. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three thousand ten patients with operable node-positive breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy with or without docetaxel. Patients who presented human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -overexpressing tumors were secondary randomly assigned to either a sequential regimen of trastuzumab (6 mg/kg every 3 weeks) for 1 year or observation. The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS: Overall 528 patients were randomly assigned between trastuzumab (n = 260) and observation (n = 268) arm. Of the 234 patients (90%) who received at least one administration of trastuzumab, 196 (84%) received at least 6 months of treatment, and 41 (18%) discontinued treatment due to cardiac events (any grade). At the date of analysis (October 2007), 129 DFS events were recorded. Random assignment to the trastuzumab arm was associated with a nonsignificant 14% reduction in the risk of relapse (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.61 to 1.22; P = .41, log-rank stratified on pathologic node involvement). Three-year DFS rates were 78% (95% CI, 72.3 to 82.5) and 81% (95% CI, 75.3 to 85.4) in the observation and trastuzumab arms, respectively. CONCLUSION: After a 47-month median follow-up, 1 year of trastuzumab given sequentially after adjuvant chemotherapy was not associated with a statistically significant decrease in the risk of relapse.",1
Randomized parallel study of doxorubicin plus paclitaxel and doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide as neoadjuvant treatment of patients with breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: This randomized, noncomparative, parallel-group study was designed to evaluate the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate of combined doxorubicin plus paclitaxel (AP) and doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide (AC) as neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated breast cancer who were unsuitable for conservative surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 200 patients with T2-3, N0-1, M0 disease were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive preoperative chemotherapy with either doxorubicin 60 mg/m(2) plus paclitaxel 200 mg/m(2) as a 3-hour infusion (AP) or doxorubicin 60 mg/m(2) plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) (AC) every 3 weeks for 4 courses followed by surgery. RESULTS: A pCR (eradication of invasive carcinoma in tumor and in axillary lymph nodes) was found in 16% and 10% of patients in the AP and AC arms, respectively, by study center pathologists, and in 8% and 6% of patients, respectively, by independent pathologists. Patients with pCRs tended to have unifocal disease, tumors with negative hormonal receptor status, and less differentiation (Scarff, Bloom, and Richardson scale grade 3). Breast-conserving surgery was performed in 58% and 45% of patients in the AP and AC arms, respectively. An objective clinical response was achieved in 89% of patients in the AP arm and 70% in the AC arm. At a median follow-up of 31 months, disease-free survival (DFS) was higher in patients who reached pCR versus those without pCR (91% v 70%). CONCLUSION: The encouraging pathologic and clinical responses of patients with breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin plus paclitaxel warrant additional investigation of paclitaxel in the neoadjuvant setting of breast cancer management.",1
The safety and efficacy of prophylactic ondansetron in patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy.,"We aimed to evaluate the antiemetic efficacy, safety, and clinical utility of prophylactic ondansetron administered at the end of the surgery for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in a homogenous population of 54 women undergoing modified radical mastectomy (MRM). A standard general anesthetic and perioperative analgesic technique were used. After surgery, patients received either saline placebo or ondansetron 4 mg IV. Episodes of PONV, as well as rescue antiemetic requirements, were recorded for the first 24 h after surgery. The 24-h incidence of PONV (33.3% vs 81.5%; P = 0.0010) was significantly lower in the ondansetron group. The severity of PONV, evaluated by the number of emetic episodes per patient (1.59+/-1.90 vs 0.29+/-0.66; P = 0.0029), and the rescue antiemetic requirement (59.2% vs 14.8%; P = 0.0019) was significantly lower, in the ondansetron group. Patient satisfaction scores and number needed to prevent PONV (2.07) were significantly better and therapeutically more favorable in the ondansetron group. The incidence of adverse events such as headache, dizziness, and increased liver enzyme levels (number needed to harm = infinity) was similar in both groups. Administered at the end of the surgery in adult female patients undergoing general anesthesia for MRM, ondansetron 4 mg is effective and safe in preventing PONV. We recommend the clinical practice of routine prophylactic ondansetron to prevent PONV after MRM, as it significantly improves perioperative patient satisfaction and outcome. IMPLICATIONS: We evaluated the antiemetic efficacy, safety, and routine use of prophylactic ondansetron, a ""gold standard"" antiemetic, in women undergoing radical breast surgery who were at a high risk of postoperative vomiting. We analyzed more meaningful ""true"" and ""therapeutic"" outcome measures, and we conclude that prophylactic ondansetron is safe and effective and that its routine use is justified.",0
Myelotoxicity as a prognostic factor in patients with advanced breast cancer treated with chemotherapy: a pooled analysis of two randomised trials conducted by the Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group.,"BACKGROUND: A number of studies have shown that absence of myelotoxicity during chemotherapy is associated with worse outcome for various types of cancer, including carcinoma of the breast. The aim of this study was to determine whether myelosuppression in patients being treated with chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer has an impact on their prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of a series of 475 patients with advanced breast cancer enrolled in two randomised trials, who received first-line chemotherapy. The impact of severe (grade 3 or 4) hematological toxicity on survival and time to disease progression was assessed. RESULTS: When severe myelotoxicity was evaluated as a whole, a significant negative association for time to disease progression and a trend for a worse survival were demonstrated. In multivariate analysis, hematological toxicity retained its significance as an independent negative prognostic factor for time to disease progression. CONCLUSION: Our findings do not confirm the results of previous studies which have demonstrated a better outcome for patients experiencing hematological toxicity during treatment.",0
"Chemical castration induced by adjuvant cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil chemotherapy causes rapid bone loss that is reduced by clodronate: a randomized study in premenopausal breast cancer patients.","PURPOSE: In the majority of premenopausal breast cancer patients, an adjuvant chemotherapy-induced early menopause occurs, which is known to be a strong predictor of osteoporosis. We present data on the effect of adjuvant cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) therapy on bone mineral density (BMD) and the efficacy of clodronate on the prevention of bone loss in 148 premenopausal breast cancer patients without skeletal metastases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive oral clodronate 1,600 mg/d or to a control group. In addition, patients were treated with six cycles of CMF therapy. BMD of the lumbar spine and femoral neck was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) before therapy and at 1 and 2 years. RESULTS: Changes in the BMD of lumbar spine and femoral neck were -5.9% and -2.0% without clodronate and -2.2% and +0.9% with clodronate at 2 years (P = .0005 and .017, respectively). Patients who developed amenorrhea after chemotherapy had a rapid bone loss, which was significantly reduced by clodronate. In controls, bone loss was 9.5% in the lumbar spine and 4.6% in the femoral neck, while in the clodronate group, bone loss was 5.9% and 0.4%, respectively, at 2 years. Patients with preserved menstruation had only marginal changes in BMD. CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy-induced ovarian failure causes rapid bone loss in premenopausal breast cancer patients. Women older than 40 years are at particularly high risk. Clodronate significantly reduces this bone loss.",0
"Benefit from adjuvant tamoxifen therapy in primary breast cancer patients according oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, EGF receptor and HER2 status.","BACKGROUND: Most women with oestrogen receptor (ER) positive primary breast cancer receive adjuvant tamoxifen after surgery. The measurement of tumour biomarkers should allow better selection of patients for such treatment or for therapies such as aromatase inhibitors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Histopathological blocks of primary breast cancer patients who had been randomized to receive 2-years tamoxifen or no adjuvant therapy in two mature randomised clinical trials were retrieved. Immunohistochemical staining for ER, progesterone receptor (PgR), HER2 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was undertaken. The primary endpoint was relapse free survival. RESULTS: 813 patients were included in the study. Benefit from tamoxifen was seen in ER-positive patients [Relative risk (rr) 0.77, ci 0.63-0.93]. ER-negative patients also showed a strong trend to benefit from tamoxifen (rr 0.73, ci 0.52-1.02) which was largely confined to the PgR-positive group. Amongst the ER-positive group, PgR-positive and PgR-negative patients showed similar benefit (rr 0.81; ci 0.65-1.02 and 0.70; ci 0.49-0.99, respectively). Patients positive for HER2 did not benefit significantly (rr 1.14; ci 0.75-1.73) but this group was small. CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of PgR status in ER-negative patients defines a group of patients that benefit from tamoxifen but would be excluded from tamoxifen therapy on the basis of ER status alone. The data are consistent with HER2 positive tumours being resistant to tamoxifen.",0
Wheat grass juice may improve hematological toxicity related to chemotherapy in breast cancer patients: a pilot study.,"Myelotoxicity induced by chemotherapy may become life-threatening. Neutropenia may be prevented by granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (GCSF), and epoetin may prevent anemia, but both cause substantial side effects and increased costs. According to non-established data, wheat grass juice (WGJ) may prevent myelotoxicity when applied with chemotherapy. In this prospective matched control study, 60 patients with breast carcinoma on chemotherapy were enrolled and assigned to an intervention or control arm. Those in the intervention arm (A) were given 60 cc of WGJ orally daily during the first three cycles of chemotherapy, while those in the control arm (B) received only regular supportive therapy. Premature termination of treatment, dose reduction, and starting GCSF or epoetin were considered as ""censoring events."" Response rate to chemotherapy was calculated in patients with evaluable disease. Analysis of the results showed that five censoring events occurred in Arm A and 15 in Arm B (P = 0.01). Of the 15 events in Arm B, 11 were related to hematological events. No reduction in response rate was observed in patients who could be assessed for response. Side effects related to WGJ were minimal, including worsening of nausea in six patients, causing cessation of WGJ intake. In conclusion, it was found that WGJ taken during FAC chemotherapy may reduce myelotoxicity, dose reductions, and need for GCSF support, without diminishing efficacy of chemotherapy. These preliminary results need confirmation in a phase III study.",0

Postchemotherapy adjuvant tamoxifen therapy beyond five years in patients with lymph node-positive breast cancer. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group.,"BACKGROUND: Data from a pilot study published in 1984 suggested that tamoxifen administration (as adjuvant hormonal therapy) for more than 5 years after initial breast cancer surgery might have therapeutic benefit. PURPOSE: A randomized trial was performed to assess the efficacy of maintaining tamoxifen therapy beyond 5 years in women with axillary lymph node-positive breast cancer who had been treated with surgery followed by 1 year of chemotherapy and 5 years of tamoxifen. METHODS: One hundred ninety-four women (87 postmenopausal and 107 premenopasual) enrolled in two concurrent Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group adjuvant trials (E4181 for postmenopausal patients and E5181 for premenopausal patients) were randomly assigned to continued tamoxifen therapy or observation. Data for 193 women (87 postmenopausal and 106 premenopausal) were available for analysis. Median follow-up is 5.6 years since the randomization at 5 years, with the longest follow-up being 8.0 years. The major analyses measured events from the time of randomization until relapse or death; these included time-to-relapse analyses, with new opposite-breast cancers counted as treatment failures, and survival analyses. Time-to-relapse comparisons and survival comparisons for women in the two treatment groups were made by use of the Kaplan-Meier method and the logrank test. Reported P values are two-sided. RESULTS: Five years after the randomization, no statistically significant differences were noted in either time to relapse or survival between women continuing to receive tamoxifen and those on observation. Eight-five percent of the women receiving tamoxifen were disease free at this time compared with 73% of those on observation (P = .10); survival was 86% for those continuing to receive tamoxifen and 89% for those on observation (P = .52). Differences in the time to relapse and survival between premenopausal and postmenopausal women assigned to the two treatment groups were also not statistically significant (time to relapse: P = .38 and P = .16 for premenopausal and postmenopausal patients, respectively; survival; P = .18 and P = .72 for premenopausal and postmenopausal patients, respectively). There was an indication that women with estrogen receptor-positive tumors may experience a longer time to relapse with continued tamoxifen therapy (P = .014); however, the survival difference for this subgroup was not statistically significant (P = .81). The toxicity patterns in the two treatment groups were similar. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our results suggest that further evaluation of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy beyond 5 years in women with axillary lymph node-positive, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer who have also been treated with adjuvant chemotherapy would be appropriate.",1
"Randomized phase II study of two irinotecan schedules for patients with metastatic breast cancer refractory to an anthracycline, a taxane, or both.","PURPOSE: A pressing need exists for agents active against anthracycline- or taxane-refractory metastatic breast cancer (MBC), or both. Previous clinical trials suggested that irinotecan might have such activity. We conducted this multicenter phase II study to assess efficacy and tolerability of two irinotecan schedules. PATIENTS AND METHODS: MBC patients who experienced disease progression after one to three chemotherapy regimens, including at least one anthracycline- or taxane-based regimen, were randomly assigned to irinotecan in 6-week cycles comprising 100 mg/m(2) weekly for 4 weeks, then a 2-week rest (weekly) or 240 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks. RESULTS: The weekly arm had 52 assessable patients; the every-3-weeks arm had 51 assessable patients. In the weekly arm, the objective response (complete regression [CR] + partial regression [PR]) rate was 23% (one CR, 11 PR; 95% CI, 13% to 37%). Median response duration was 4.9 months (range, 1.9 to 15.9 months), and median overall survival was 9.7 months (95% CI, 8.0 to 14.2 months). In the every-3-weeks arm, the objective response rate was 14% (nine PR; 95% CI, 6% to 26%), median response duration was 4.2 months (range, 3.1 to 13.9 months), and median overall survival was 8.6 months (95% CI, 7.0 to 12.3 months). Treatment generally was well tolerated, especially in the weekly arm. Grade 3 to 4 adverse events with > or = 10% incidence included neutropenia (29%) and diarrhea (17%) in the weekly arm and neutropenia (36%), vomiting (20%), dyspnea (18%), nausea (16%), and diarrhea (12%) in the every-3-weeks arm. CONCLUSION: Irinotecan is active with good tolerability in refractory MBC. Irinotecan (especially weekly) warrants additional study as monotherapy and in combination regimens in this setting.",1
Health-related quality of life among patients with breast cancer receiving zoledronic acid or pamidronate disodium for metastatic bone lesions.,"BACKGROUND: Research on individual differences in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) can identify intervention targets and important covariates in analyses of treatment outcomes. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to describe HRQOL trajectories for women with metastatic breast cancer in a randomized trial of bisphosphonates and to identify characteristics associated with variations in HRQOL. RESEARCH DESIGN: We conducted a prospective quality-of-life study within a randomized, controlled trial. SUBJECTS: We studied women with metastatic breast cancer receiving zoledronic acid or pamidronate disodium to reduce the incidence of skeletal-related events (SREs). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: HRQOL was measured at fixed time points during the trial. Individual growth-curve modeling was used to describe longitudinal trajectories and to identify predictors of trajectories. RESULTS: For most domains of HRQOL, the mean trajectory reflected a mild increase, which leveled off later in the trial. Older age and full-time employment were associated with higher baseline HRQOL. Longer time from cancer diagnosis to randomization, lower Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status (score of 2 [""inactive""]), and a history of SREs were associated with lower baseline HRQOL. Significant differences across geographic regions were observed for all domains. Active ECOG status (score of 0-1) at baseline was predictive of greater increases in all domains of HRQOL except Social/Family Well-Being. Age, geographic region, and time from first bone metastases to randomization were associated with longitudinal changes in some domains. CONCLUSIONS: Women with metastatic breast cancer receiving bisphosphonates for prevention of SREs experienced an overall increase in HRQOL. Variations among women's experiences are explained partly by such characteristics as a history of SREs.",0
Adjuvant tamoxifen treatment of elderly women with stage II breast cancer. A double-blind comparison with placebo.,"One hundred seventy elderly women with stage II breast cancer, stratified on the basis of the number of positive axillary nodes and estrogen receptor status, were randomly assigned to receive tamoxifen or placebo for 24 months in a prospective, double-blind, adjuvant trial. The median age was 71 years with a range from 65 to 84 years. The overall percentage of patients disease-free at 4 years was 76% for those given tamoxifen and 52% for those given placebo (p = 0.0004). Benefit was seen in all subgroups of patients treated with tamoxifen. Two years of tamoxifen therapy represents an effective postoperative adjuvant treatment for elderly women with stage II breast cancer, resulting in improved time to relapse, statistically fewer distant first recurrences, and minimal toxicity. No improvement in overall survival has been seen yet.",1
Impact of group psychotherapy in chemotherapy induced vomiting for treatment of advanced breast and lungs cancer.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of group psychotherapy in the management of the side effects of chemotherapy treatment in advanced breast and lung cancer. DESIGN: A randomized control study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: This study was conducted in the department of Oncology, King Fahad Hospital, Madina Munawra, KSA, from January 2002 to June 2005. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred patients treated with chemotherapy for advanced stage (IIIB and IV) breast and lung cancer were selected with ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. All patients received anti-emetic medications half an hour before chemotherapy. All those patients in this category who completed fist line chemotherapy with 6 cycles were included. Fifty were subjected to group discussions with other patients, family members and medical staff. This was labeled group A. The other 50 were not included in group discussion and were labeled group B. Both the group received similar standard chemotherapy and pre-medication for vomiting as per their disease and chemotherapy schedule. Breast and lung cancer patients were 29 and 21 in each arm respectively. At the end of the discharge, grade 2 and above of vomiting, according to common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) was counted for all patients in both the arms A and B, over full length of treatment for 6 cycles, and then were compared statistically. RESULTS: Mean with standard deviation for adverse event (vomiting) in group A and B was 6.2 + 2.6 and 13.4 + 3.8 respectively per cycle of treatment. It was observed that group psychotherapy had statistically significant effect (p-value < 0.05) on the management of vomiting. CONCLUSION: Group psychotherapy can be used to reduce the incidence of vomiting in advanced breast and lung cancer patients treated with chemotherapy.",0
"Neoadjuvant treatment of postmenopausal breast cancer with anastrozole, tamoxifen, or both in combination: the Immediate Preoperative Anastrozole, Tamoxifen, or Combined with Tamoxifen (IMPACT) multicenter double-blind randomized trial.","PURPOSE: The Immediate Preoperative Anastrozole, Tamoxifen, or Combined With Tamoxifen (IMPACT) trial was designed to test the hypothesis that the clinical and/or biologic effects of neoadjuvant tamoxifen compared with anastrozole and with the combination of tamoxifen and anastrozole before surgery in postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor (ER) -positive, invasive, nonmetastatic breast cancer might predict for outcome in the Arimidex, Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination (ATAC) adjuvant therapy trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Postmenopausal women with ER-positive, invasive, nonmetastatic, and operable or locally advanced potentially operable breast cancer were randomly assigned to neoadjuvant tamoxifen (20 mg daily), anastrozole (1 mg daily), or a combination of tamoxifen and anastrozole for 3 months. The tumor objective response (OR) was assessed by both caliper and ultrasound. Comparisons were also made of clinical response with ultrasound response, actual and feasible surgery with feasible surgery at baseline, OR in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive cancers, and tolerability. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in OR in the intent-to-treat population between patients receiving tamoxifen, anastrozole, or the combination. In patients who were assessed as requiring mastectomy at baseline (n = 124), 44% of patients received breast-conserving surgery (BCS) after anastrozole compared with 31% of patients after tamoxifen (P = .23); this difference became significant for patients who were deemed feasible for BCS by their surgeon (46% v 22%, respectively; P = .03). The OR for patients with HER2-positive cancer (n = 34) was 58% for anastrozole compared with 22% for tamoxifen (P = .18). All treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Neoadjuvant anastrozole is as effective and well tolerated as tamoxifen in ER-positive operable breast cancer in postmenopausal women, but the hypothesis that clinical outcome might predict for long-term outcome in adjuvant therapy was not fulfilled.",1
"A randomized double-blind comparison of ondansetron and metoclopramide in the prophylaxis of emesis induced by cyclophosphamide, fluorouracil, and doxorubicin or epirubicin chemotherapy.","Seventy-five breast cancer patients scheduled to receive a first course (in a new cycle) of cyclophosphamide, fluorouracil, and doxorubicin (FAC) or epirubicin (FEC) participated in a double-blind crossover study to compare the antiemetic efficacy and safety of ondansetron (GR38032), a 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist, and metoclopramide. Ondansetron was given as an 8 mg loading dose (4 mg intravenously [IV] plus 4 mg orally) before chemotherapy followed by 8 mg every 8 hours orally for 3 to 5 days. Metoclopramide was given as an 80 mg loading dose (60 mg IV plus 20 mg orally) before chemotherapy followed by 20 mg every 8 hours orally for 3 to 5 days. A ""period"" interaction in the analysis of emetic response in the first 24 hours necessitated a parallel group analysis of first treatments only, 68 patients being assessable for this parameter. In the first 24 hours, complete or major control (zero to two emetic episodes) of emesis was achieved in 30 of 35 (86%) patients receiving ondansetron and in 14 of 33 (42%) patients receiving metoclopramide (P less than .001). Ondansetron was also more effective in reducing acute nausea. On days 2 to 3, the complete or major responses were significantly better with ondansetron (81% v 65%; P = .033), but there was no statistical difference in the control of nausea. There was a significant patient preference for ondansetron (63% v 26%; P = .001). Extrapyramidal reactions were observed in two metoclopramide treatments; both treatments were otherwise well tolerated. These results are consistent with serotonin (5-HT), being a significant neurotransmitter of cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin- or epirubicin/fluorouracil-induced emesis.",0
Five-year outcome for women randomised in a phase III trial comparing doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide with doxorubicin and docetaxel as primary medical therapy in early breast cancer: an Anglo-Celtic Cooperative Oncology Group study.,"To compare the long-term outcome of women with primary or locally advanced breast cancer randomised to receive either doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) or doxorubicin and docetaxel (AD) as primary chemotherapy. Eligible patients with histologic-proven breast cancer with primary tumours > or = 3 cm, inflammatory or locally advanced disease, and no evidence of distant metastases, were randomised to receive a maximum of 6 cycles of either doxorubicin (60 mg/m(2)) plus cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m(2)) i/v or doxorubicin (50 mg/m(2)) plus docetaxel (75 mg/m(2)) i/v every 3 weeks, followed by surgery on completion of chemotherapy. Clinical and pathologic responses have previously been reported. Time to relapse, site of relapse, and all-cause mortality were recorded. This updated analysis compares long-term disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS) using stratified log rank methods. A total of 363 patients were randomised to AC (n = 181) or AD (n = 182). A complete pathologic response was observed in 16% for AC and 12% for AD (P = 0.43). The number of patients with positive axillary nodes at surgery with AC was 61% and AD 66% (P = 0.36). At a median follow-up of 99 months there is no significant difference between the two groups for DFS (P = 0.20) and OS (P = 0.24). Deaths were due to metastatic breast cancer in 96% of patients. Our data do not support a clinical benefit for simultaneous administration of AD compared with AC. However, the data do not exclude a smaller benefit than the study was powered to detect and are consistent with an increase in both disease-free and overall survival of about 5% for AD compared with AC. Outcome is consistent with the pathologic complete response following surgery.",1
Trial assessing individualized options for treatment for breast cancer: the TAILORx trial.,"Novel genetic profiling tests of breast cancer tissue have been shown to be prognostic for overall survival and predictive of local and distant rates of recurrence in breast cancer patients. One of these tests, Oncotype DXtrade mark, is a diagnostic test comprised of a 21-gene assay applied to paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissue, which allows physicians to predict subgroups of hormone-receptor-positive, node-negative patients who may benefit from hormonal therapy alone or require adjuvant chemotherapy to attain the best survival outcome. The results of the assay are converted to a recurrence score (0-100) that has been found to be predictive of 10- and 15-year local and distant recurrence in node-negative, estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer patients. Previous studies have shown that patients with high recurrence scores benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, whereas patients with low recurrence scores do not. To evaluate the ability to guide treatment decisions in the group with a mid-range recurrence score, the North American Cooperative Groups developed the Trial Assessing IndiviuaLized Options for Treatment for breast cancer, a randomized trial of chemotherapy followed by hormonal therapy versus hormonal therapy alone on invasive disease-free survival-ductal carcinoma in situ (IDFS-DCIS) survival in women with node-negative, estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer with a recurrence score of 11-25. The study was initiated in May 2006 and approximately 4500 patients will be randomized. This article describes the rationale, methodology, statistical ana-lysis and implications of the results on clinical practice.",0
The modulating effects of flurbiprofen on adriamycin plus vincristine or vindesine in the treatment of advanced breast cancer.,"To assess the modulating effects of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug on chemotherapeutic agents, 183 patients with advanced breast cancer have been treated in a randomised study with flurbiprofen or placebo and adriamycin plus a vinca alkaloid. To assess the efficacy of the new vinca alkaloid, vindesine, in breast cancer, patients were further randomised to receive vindesine or vincristine. The overall response rate in evaluable patients was 57%, and the median duration of response in the different treatment groups varied from 6 to 10 months. Response rates and toxicity in vindesine- and vincristine-treated patients were similar, although with vindesine neurotoxicity was slightly lower. Flurbiprofen did not improve the response rate or reduce the toxicity of adriamycin plus vinca alkaloid.",0
"Effect of soy phytoestrogens on hot flashes in postmenopausal women with breast cancer: a randomized, controlled clinical trial.","PURPOSE: Vasomotor symptoms, such as hot flashes and night sweats, in breast cancer survivors are often worsened by chemotherapy and tamoxifen, and/or the discontinuation of hormone replacement therapy at diagnosis. This study evaluated the acceptability and effectiveness of a soy beverage containing phytoestrogens as a treatment for hot flashes in postmenopausal women with breast cancer. METHODS: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial was conducted in postmenopausal women with moderate hot flashes who were previously treated for early-stage breast cancer. Women were stratified for tamoxifen use and randomized to a soy beverage (n = 59) containing 90 mg of isoflavones or to a placebo rice beverage (n = 64). Women recorded the number and severity of hot flashes daily with a daily menopause diary for 4 weeks at baseline and for 12 weeks while consuming 500 mL of a soy or placebo beverage. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the soy and placebo groups in the number of hot flashes or hot flash scores. However, presumably because of a strong placebo effect, both groups had significant reductions in hot flashes. Mild gastrointestinal side effects were experienced by both groups but occurred with greater frequency and severity with soy. The mean serum genistein concentration at 6 weeks was significantly higher in women who consumed soy (0.61 +/- 0.43 micromol/L) compared with placebo (0.43 +/- 0.37 micromol/L) (P =.02). Overall acceptability and compliance were high and similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: The soy beverage did not alleviate hot flashes in women with breast cancer any more than did a placebo. Future research into other compounds is recommended to identify safe and effective therapies for hot flashes in breast cancer survivors.",0
Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation vs. transcutaneous spinal electroanalgesia for chronic pain associated with breast cancer treatments.,"Chronic pain associated with breast cancer treatment is becoming increasingly recognized. Patients with this condition can experience significant physical and psychological morbidity and may benefit from nonpharmacological interventions as part of a multidisciplinary team approach. We compared the effectiveness of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), transcutaneous spinal electroanalgesia (TSE), and a placebo (sham TSE) in a randomized controlled trial. The study sample comprised 41 women with chronic pain following breast cancer treatment, and outcome measures included pain report, pain relief, pain interference, anxiety and depression, arm mobility, and analgesic consumption. There was little evidence to suggest that TENS or TSE were more effective than placebo. All three interventions had beneficial effects on both pain report and quality of life, a finding that may be due to either psychophysical improvements resulting from the personal interaction involved in the treatment or a placebo response. Although electrical stimulation appears to be well tolerated in this population, further research is needed to establish its effectiveness for chronic cancer treatment-related pain.",0
c-erbB-2 expression and response to adjuvant therapy in women with node-positive early breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: The role of molecular markers in predicting the response to treatment of breast cancer is poorly defined. The Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) conducted a randomized adjuvant-chemotherapy trial (CALGB 8541) comparing three doses (high, moderate, and low) of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil in 1572 women with node-positive breast cancer. This study (CALGB 8869) was designed to determine whether the DNA index, the S-phase fraction, c-erbB-2 expression, or p53 accumulation could be used as a marker to identify a subgroup of patients more likely than others to benefit from high doses of chemotherapy. METHODS: Tissue blocks were obtained from 442 patients randomly selected from the larger CALGB trial. Paraffin sections from the primary lesions were analyzed for DNA content, S-phase fraction, c-erbB-2 expression, and p53 accumulation. RESULTS: Patients randomly assigned to the high-dose regimen of adjuvant chemotherapy had significantly longer disease-free and overall survival if their tumors had c-erbB-2 overexpression. No further information was gained by adding the data on S-phase fraction or p53 accumulation to the analysis. There was no clear evidence of a dose-response effect in patients with minimal or no c-erbB-2 expression. CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant dose-response effect of adjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil in patients with overexpression of c-erbB-2 but not in patients with no c-erbB-2 expression or minimal c-erbB-2 expression. Overexpression of c-erbB-2 may be a useful marker to identify the patients who are most likely to benefit from high doses of adjuvant chemotherapy.",0
Twenty-year results of the Naples GUN randomized trial: predictive factors of adjuvant tamoxifen efficacy in early breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: Tamoxifen (TAM) is increasingly administered to new early breast cancer patients. Because it is not devoid of toxic effects, we studied factors potentially predictive of its efficacy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: From 1978 to 1983, 433 patients were enrolled in the GUN randomized trial: 206 were assigned to TAM versus 227 controls (no-TAM). Premenopausal patients with axillary lymph node involvement (60 TAM versus 65 no-TAM) also received nine CMF cycles. Eight biological markers were retrospectively assayed for most patients: estrogen; progesterone; prolactin receptors (PrlRs); microvessel count (MVC); S-phase fraction; tumor ploidy; epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR); and HER2. We performed a multivariate test of the TAM/covariate interactions to establish whether these variables predicted for TAM efficacy. Estimates of the TAM effect were expressed as hazard ratio (HR) of death of TAM over no-TAM patients with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 15 years, PrlRs, MVC, S-phase fraction, ploidy, and EGFR did not influence TAM efficacy. Differently, HER2 had an overall significant predictive effect: HR = 0.59 (95% CI: 0.40-0.87) in HER2-negative subjects versus HR = 1.09 (95% CI: 0.63-1.87) in HER2-positive subjects (interaction test: P = 0.04). The predictive effect of HER2 was also evident in the subgroup of patients with steroid receptor-positive tumors (HER2 positive: HR = 1.33, 95% CI: 0.70-2.51; HER2 negative: HR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.47-1.14). CONCLUSIONS: With the statistical power of the present randomized trial, S-phase, ploidy, EGFR, PrlR, and MVC do not seem to predict for TAM efficacy. Conversely, our data support the hypothesis that tumors overexpressing HER2 might not benefit from adjuvant TAM.",0
Prolonged disease-free survival after one course of perioperative adjuvant chemotherapy for node-negative breast cancer.,"We compared a single perioperative cycle of adjuvant combination chemotherapy with no adjuvant treatment in a randomized trial (Ludwig Trial V) including 1275 patients with breast cancer who had no axillary-node metastases. The chemotherapy was administered on days 1 and 8, beginning within 36 hours after mastectomy, and consisted of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil, and leucovorin. At a median follow-up of 42 months, the mean four-year disease-free survival (+/- SE) was 77 +/- 2 percent among the patients who received chemotherapy perioperatively, as compared with 73 +/- 2 percent among the patients who received no adjuvant treatment (hazard ratio, 0.77; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.61 to 0.98; P = 0.04). An advantage was observed for both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. The magnitude of the treatment effect was largest among patients with no or low estrogen-receptor content in the primary tumor. We conclude that chemotherapy modifies the post-operative course of node-negative breast cancer. Further trials to investigate an optimal selection of patients and treatments should be regarded as the best available therapeutic approach.",1

Local recurrence in breast cancer after conservative surgery: timing of radiotherapy and sequencing of chemotherapy.,"BACKGROUND: A randomized trial was conducted to determine (a) the role of radiotherapy and chemotherapy on local control and (b) to determine the timing of radiotherapy for early-stage breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five hundred and ninety patients were treated with both conservative surgery and radiotherapy (group A). The average time interval between surgery and radiation was 90 days for 452 patients and over 90 days for 138 patients. One hundred and ninety-four patients underwent adjuvant therapy based on CMF regimens (group B). RESULTS: Among 396 patients of group A, 8.1% had local failure; we observed 7.2% local recurrences in 363 patients who received therapy before 90 days and 18.2% in patients who received therapy after 90 days. Among patients of group B, 7.7% had local failure; for patients who underwent radiotherapy before 90 days, the local recurrence rate was 6.6%, compared with 12.3% for patients who underwent therapy more than 90 days after surgery. CONCLUSION: In patients who are eligible to receive chemotherapy, it is possible to administer radiotherapy after systemic treatment, while in patients who have to be treated with radiotherapy more then 90 days after breast surgery, chemotherapy can reduce the local failure rate.",0
A randomized trial exploring the biomarker effects of neoadjuvant sequential treatment with exemestane and anastrozole in post-menopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.,"Several adjuvant endocrine strategies exist for postmenopausal women with breast cancer. This study compared the effect of two sequences of aromatase inhibitor use [steroidal (exemestane) and non-steroidal (anastrozole)] on serological and pathological biomarkers when given in the neoadjuvant setting to postmenopausal women with breast cancer. Thirty women were assigned to receive exemestane 25 mg or anastrozole 1 mg each given for 8 weeks in a randomized sequence. The effect of this treatment on serum estrone sulfate and estradiol levels, as well as tumor changes in the proliferation biomarker Ki67 were evaluated at baseline, 8 weeks and 16 weeks. WHO clinical response criteria, patient preference, and quality of life were also assessed. Assessable data was available from 28 patients. There were no differences in concentration changes of serum estradiol or Ki67 between patients in the two arms. Overall clinical response rate was 68% (19/28 assessable patients) and clinical benefit was 93% (26/28 assessable patients). There was no significant difference in toxicity or quality of life scores. The majority of patients expressed a personal preference for anastrozole over exemestane. Results suggest that the order of steroidal and non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors has little effect on outcome. The majority of patients express clear preferences for drug treatments.",1
"Dofequidar fumarate (MS-209) in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil for patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancer.","PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of dofequidar plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF) therapy in comparison with CAF alone, in patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancer. Dofequidar is a novel, orally active quinoline derivative that reverses multidrug resistance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients were treated with six cycles of CAF therapy: 28 days/cycle, with doxorubicin (25 mg/m2) and fluorouracil (500 mg/m2) administered on days 1 and 8 and cyclophosphamide (100 mg orally [PO]) administered on day 1 through 14. Patients received dofequidar (900 mg PO) 30 minutes before each dose of doxorubicin. Primary end point was overall response rate (ORR; partial or complete response). In total, 221 patients were assessable. RESULTS: ORR was 42.6% for CAF compared with 53.1% for dofequidar + CAF, a 24.6% relative improvement and 10.5% absolute increase (P = .077). There was a trend for prolonged progression-free survival (PFS; median 241 days for CAF v 366 days for dofequidar + CAF; P = .145). In retrospectively defined subgroups, significant improvement in PFS in favor of dofequidar was observed in patients who were premenopausal, had no prior therapy, and were stage IV at diagnosis with an intact primary tumor. Except for neutropenia and leukopenia, there was no statistically significant excess of grade 3/4 adverse events compared with CAF. Treatment with dofequidar did not affect the plasma concentration of doxorubicin. CONCLUSION: Dofequidar + CAF was well tolerated and is suggested to have efficacy in patients who had not received prior therapy.",1
"A double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of MAS065D (XClair), a hyaluronic acid-based formulation, in the management of radiation-induced dermatitis.","This study was designed to assess the efficacy and tolerability of MAS065D (Xclair) compared to a vehicle control in the management of radiation dermatitis in patients receiving radiotherapy for breast cancer. Twenty patients were randomized blindly to use the two study substances, three times daily, on separate sections of irradiated skin throughout the duration of radiotherapy and for two weeks afterwards. Patients were monitored before therapy, weekly during therapy, and for 2 weeks after radiotherapy was completed. Skin appearance according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) toxicity criteria, erythema rating, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin hydration, patients' view of itch, pain, acceptance, and view of each cream and adverse events, were monitored; at the final visit patients and investigators expressed their preference for one of the creams. MAS065D showed statistically significant superiority in the outcomes of NCI grading for radiation dermatitis and erythema. Patients' and investigators' preferences for one of the study substances were statistically in favor of MAS065D. Very few patients recorded nonzero itch and pain scales, so no significant differences emerged between the two groups. It was concluded that MAS065D can provide an effective option for managing radiation dermatitis although further studies are needed to assess its effect on pain and itch.",0
Neoadjuvant versus adjuvant chemotherapy in premenopausal patients with tumours considered too large for breast conserving surgery: preliminary results of a randomised trial: S6.,"The aim of this study was to assess a potential advantage in survival by neoadjuvant as compared to adjuvant chemotherapy. 414 premenopausal patients with T2-T3 N0-N1 M0 breast cancer were randomised to receive either four cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil), followed by local-regional treatment (group I) or four cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy after primary irradiation +/- surgery (group II). Surgery was limited to those patients with a persisting mass after irradiation, and aimed to be as conservative as possible. 390 patients were evaluable. With a median follow-up of 54 months, we observed a statistically significant difference (P = 0.039) in survival in favour of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group. A similar trend was seen when the time to metastatic recurrence was evaluated (P = 0.09). At this stage, no difference in disease-free interval or local recurrence between these two groups could be observed. The mean total dose of chemotherapy administered was similar in both groups. On average, group I had more intensive chemotherapy regimes (doxorubicin P = 0.02) but fewer treatment courses (P = 0.008) as compared to the treated patients in group II. Haematological tolerance was reduced when chemotherapy succeeded to exclusive irradiation. Breast conservation was identical for both groups at the end of primary treatment (82 and 77% for groups I and II, respectively). Of the 191 evaluable patients in the neoadjuvant treatment arm, 65% had an objective response (> 50% regression) following four cycles of chemotherapy. The objective response rate to primary irradiation (55 Gy) was 85%. Improved survival figures in the neoadjuvant treatment arm could be the result of the early initiation of chemotherapy, but we cannot exclude that this difference might be attributable to a slightly more aggressive treatment. So far, the trend in favour of decreased metastases was not statistically significant. The local control appeared similar in both subgroups.",1
Treatment of advanced hormone-sensitive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with exemestane alone or in combination with celecoxib.,"PURPOSE: Preclinical data showed that the combination of exemestane and celecoxib has synergistic effects. Therefore, a study was undertaken to explore the efficacy and tolerability of this combination in postmenopausal patients with advanced, hormone-sensitive breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomized phase II study was conducted in postmenopausal patients with hormone-sensitive breast cancer and measurable disease who had progressive disease after treatment with tamoxifen. Patients were randomly assigned to either exemestane 25 mg daily or the combination of exemestane 25 mg daily with celecoxib 400 mg twice daily. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Group criteria were used to determine antitumor efficacy. Primary end point was the rate of clinical benefit. Secondary end points were tolerability, objective response rate, time to progression (TTP), and duration of clinical benefit. A pharmacodynamic and a pharmacokinetic study were conducted in parallel. RESULTS: One hundred eleven patients (exemestane, n = 55; combination, n = 56) were enrolled in 2002. The demographic characteristics and prognostic factors were similar in both arms. In the assessable population, 24 of 51 patients in the combination arm and 24 of 49 patients in the exemestane arm achieved clinical benefit. TTP was similar in both groups. Duration of clinical benefit was longer in the combination group (median, 96.6 v 49.1 weeks). The addition of celecoxib did not change the tolerability profile of exemestane alone. CONCLUSION: Similar rates of clinical benefit were achieved in both groups.",1
Bone turnover markers in postmenopausal breast cancer treated with fulvestrant--a pilot study.,"BACKGROUND: Tamoxifen has a protective effect on bone metabolism in breast cancer; aromatase inhibitors deleterious and that of fulvestrant is unknown. METHODS: Fourteen locally advanced breast cancers with clinical benefit on fulvestrant (250 mg/month) as first-line primary endocrine therapy had sequential serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP), N-terminal propeptide of procollagen type 1 (PINP) and C-terminal telopeptide (CTX) at 0, 1, 6, 12, and 18 months. Mean percentage changes (95% CI) were calculated. RESULTS: Changes from baseline at 1, 6, 12, and 18 months with BAP (3.9-46.8 ng/ml) were +1.5 (-9.8 to +12.9), +2.2 (-22.1 to +26.6), +17.6 (-12.4 to +47.6), +10.8 (-29.9 to +51.7); with PINP (20.6-82.1 ng/ml) were +3.4 (-12.0 to 19.0), +18.8 (-36.7 to +74.2), +47.5 (-21.4 to 116.3), +33.3 (-49.5 to +116.1) and with CTX (0.14-1.35 ng/ml) were +30.8 (0.1 to +61.6), +13.9 (-22.3 to +50.2), +42.9 (-12.7 to +98.5), +45.2 (-28.3 to +118.8). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term (18 months) stability of bone markers may be exploited by using fulvestrant earlier in sequence of endocrine therapies particularly in adjuvant setting in those with pre-existing decreased bone mass.",0
Chemotherapy versus chemoimmunotherapy (CAF v CAFVP v CMF each +/- MER) for metastatic carcinoma of the breast: a CALGB study. Cancer and Leukemia Group B.,"Three combination chemotherapy regimens each with or without the methanol-extracted residue of bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) (MER) were compared for efficacy. After stratification for disease-free interval and dominant sites of disease, patients were randomized to either CMF (cyclophosphamide [CYC], 100 mg/m2 orally, days 1 through 14; methotrexate [MTX], 40 mg intravenously [IV], days 1 and 8; 5-fluorouracil [5-FU], 500 mg/m2 IV, days 1 and 8), or CAF (CYC, 100 mg/m2 orally, days 1 through 14; doxorubicin [DOX], 25 mg/m2 IV, days 1 and 8; 5-FU, 500 mg/m2 IV, days 1 and 8), or CAFVP (CAF as above plus vincristine [VCR], 1.0 mg/m2 IV, days 1 and 8; and prednisone [PRED], 40 mg/m2 orally, days 1 through 14). Nonspecific immunotherapy with MER was administered in five sites at 100 micrograms or at the lowest tenfold dilution that produced a 1-cm indurated lesion. A total of 432 patients were entered, but 37 were disqualified, leaving 395 evaluable for treatment results and toxicities. One hundred thirty-five evaluable patients were randomized to chemoimmunotherapy until October 28, 1978. One hundred twenty-six evaluable patients were randomized to chemotherapy alone in the same time period. For the entire study, a total of 260 evaluable patients were randomized to chemotherapy. Chemoimmunotherapy patients were compared with the initial 126 chemotherapy patients. Chemotherapy regimens were compared among all 260 patients. Patient characteristics were similar between regimens and between chemotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy treatment groups. For patients on chemotherapy plus MER, there was no significant differences between the regimens for response frequencies: 43%, 41%, and 32%, respectively for CMF, CAF, and CAFVP. The comparable chemotherapy alone group had 36%, 58%, and 63% response, respectively. The response rates, adjusted for chemotherapy regimen, were 52% and 38% (P = .02) for chemotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy, respectively. MER was associated with painful ulcers and fevers. Thus, MER produced toxicity without response or survival benefit and further randomization after October 28, 1978 was to chemotherapy alone. For 260 evaluable patients on chemotherapy alone, the complete (CR) and partial responses (PR) were 37%, 55%, and 58%, respectively for CMF, CAF, and CAFVP. These response rates for CAF and CAFVP were significantly better than CMF (P = .01 and P less than .01, respectively). These comparisons were consistent within subgroupings such as dominant sites of disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1
Improved overall survival in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer after anastrozole initiated after treatment with tamoxifen compared with continued tamoxifen: the ARNO 95 Study.,"PURPOSE: In postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive early breast cancer, surgery is usually followed by a 5-year course of tamoxifen. This report presents results of a prospective, open-label, randomized study, designed to evaluate the benefits of switching to anastrozole after 2 years of tamoxifen treatment, compared with continuing on tamoxifen for 5 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: After receiving tamoxifen treatment for 2 years, eligible patients (n = 979) were randomly assigned to switch to anastrozole (1 mg/d) or continue tamoxifen (20 or 30 mg/d) for an additional 3 years. Patients were monitored every 6 months during years 1 to 3 and annually thereafter. The primary efficacy variable was disease-free survival, including local or distant recurrence, new contralateral breast cancer, or death. Secondary variables were overall survival and assessment of safety. RESULTS: Switching to anastrozole resulted in a significant reduction in the risk of disease recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 0.66; 95% CI, 0.44 to 1.00; P = .049), and improved overall survival (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.99; P = .045) compared with continuing on tamoxifen. Fewer patients who switched to anastrozole reported serious adverse events (22.7% v 30.8%) compared with those who continued on tamoxifen, mainly due to more patients in the tamoxifen group with endometrial events. The overall safety profile for anastrozole was consistent with previous reports and no new safety issues were identified. CONCLUSION: Postmenopausal women who have taken tamoxifen for 2 years as adjuvant therapy are less likely to experience a recurrence of breast cancer and have improved overall survival if they switch to anastrozole compared with continuing to receive tamoxifen.",1
A decade of letrozole: FACE.,"Third-generation nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors (AIs), letrozole and anastrozole, are superior to tamoxifen as initial therapy for early breast cancer but have not been directly compared in a head-to-head adjuvant trial. Cumulative evidence suggests that AIs are not equivalent in terms of potency of estrogen suppression and that there may be differences in clinical efficacy. Thus, with no data from head-to-head comparisons of the AIs as adjuvant therapy yet available, the question of whether there are efficacy differences between the AIs remains. To help answer this question, the Femara versus Anastrozole Clinical Evaluation (FACE) is a phase IIIb open-label, randomized, multicenter trial designed to test whether letrozole or anastrozole has superior efficacy as adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor (HR)- and lymph node-positive breast cancer. Eligible patients (target accrual, N=4,000) are randomized to receive either letrozole 2.5 mg or anastrozole 1 mg daily for up to 5 years. The primary objective is to compare disease-free survival at 5 years. Secondary end points include safety, overall survival, time to distant metastases, and time to contralateral breast cancer. The FACE trial will determine whether or not letrozole offers a greater clinical benefit to postmenopausal women with HR+ early breast cancer at increased risk of early recurrence compared with anastrozole.",0
Impact of on-site initiation visits on patient recruitment and data quality in a randomized trial of adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: To provide empirical evidence on the impact of on-site initiation visits on the following outcomes: patient recruitment, quantity and quality of data submitted to the trial coordinating office, and patients' follow-up time. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This methodological study was performed as part of a randomized trial comparing two combination chemotherapies for adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. Centers participating to the trial were randomized to either receive systematic on-site visits (Visited group), or not (Non-visited group). RESULTS: The study was terminated after two years, while the main randomized trial continued. Of the 135 centers that had expressed an interest in the trial, only 69 randomized at least one patient (35/68 in the Visited group, 34/67 in the Non-visited group). Almost two-thirds of the patients were entered by 17 centers (10 in the Visited group, seven in the Non-visited group) that accrued more than 10 patients each. None of the prespecified outcomes favored the group of centers submitted to on-site initiation visits (ie, mean number of queries par patient: 6.1 +/- 9.7 versus 5.4 +/- 6.4, respectively for the Visited and Non-visited groups). Spontaneous transmittal of case report forms, although required by protocol, was low in both randomized groups (mean number of pages per patient: 1.5 +/- 2.0 versus 2.1 +/- 2.3, respectively), with investigators submitting about one-third of the expected forms on time (29% and 39%, respectively). LIMITATIONS: This study could not evaluate the impact of repeated on-site visits on clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION: Systematic on-site initiation visits did not contribute significantly to this clinical trial.",0
Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy followed by adjuvant tamoxifen versus nil for patients with operable breast cancer: a randomised phase III trial of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Breast Group.,"BACKGROUND: The contribution of adjuvant tamoxifen in breast cancer patients after receiving adjuvant chemotherapy is not fully established. We investigated the impact of tamoxifen, given sequentially after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with operable breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between March 1991 and June 1999, 1863 women with stages I-IIIA operable breast cancer who had undergone surgery and completed six cycles of adjuvant combination chemotherapy with either CMF, CAF, CEF, FAC or FEC were randomised to receive either tamoxifen 20 mg daily for 3 years or no further treatment. Irrespective of menstrual status and hormone receptor content of the primary tumour, patients were stratified by institute, chemotherapy scheme and age (above 50 years or younger). The main end-point was to detect a 5% increase in the 5 year survival (from 80% to 85%) in favour of antioestrogen therapy. Secondary end-points were relapse free survival (RFS), local control, incidence of second primary breast cancer and correlation of results with hormone receptor content. RESULTS: After exclusion of all patients from three sites because of inadequate documentation, a total of 1724 patients (93%) were analysed (Tam 861 and Control 863). At a median follow-up of 6.5 years, 5-year RFS on tamoxifen was 73% versus 67% in controls (p=0.035). No difference was seen in overall survival. The benefit of tamoxifen therapy was mainly seen in the subgroup of patients with histologically documented positive axillary nodes (5-year RFS on tamoxifen 71% versus 64% in the control group, p=0.044) and in patients with tumours expressing the ER and PR positive phenotype (5-year RFS on tamoxifen 77% versus 70% in the control group, p=0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Tamoxifen administered for 3 years after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy in this otherwise unselected group of patients for endocrine sensitivity had a limited impact on relapse and had no detectable effect on overall survival. The beneficial effect of tamoxifen is mainly confined to the subgroup of patients with node-positive disease and to patients with tumours expressing the ER and PR positive phenotype.",1
The effect of education in managing side effects in women receiving chemotherapy for treatment of breast cancer.,"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of informational audiotapes on self-care behaviors, state anxiety, and use of self-care behaviors; to describe the occurrence and intensity of common side effects in patients with breast cancer. DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial. SETTING: Outpatient chemotherapy clinics operated by a university center in a rural area. SAMPLE: 70 women receiving their first treatment of chemotherapy. METHODS: Subjects completed demographic data and the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety instrument (stai). The experimental group received two audiotapes. At one and three months, subjects completed the modified nail self-care diary and stai via telephone. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: State anxiety, side-effect severity, and use and efficacy of self-care behaviors. FINDINGS: The most frequent side effects were fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and taste change. The experimental group reported symptom improvements that were not found in the control group. The experimental group increased the use of recommended self-care behaviors, whereas the control group continued to use the same self-care behaviors without effectiveness. State anxiety for both groups diminished over time; however, anxiety in the control group was consistently higher. CONCLUSIONS: Audiotapes are effective teaching tools. Self-care behaviors can be taught and can be effective in managing side effects. Anxiety was high in both groups, but the symptom decreased in the women who received audiotapes and telephone calls. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Constraints on nurses decrease the length of teaching time available, but audiotapes provide effective teaching and reinforcement of education. Anxiety in clinical environments interferes with patient learning. Teaching effective self-care behaviors enhances patients' independence, comfort, control, and quality of life.",0
Distant recurrence in breast cancer. Survival expectations and first choice of chemotherapy regimen.,"Controversial questions in recurrent breast cancer include the magnitude of the survival benefit of combination chemotherapy and the best choice of first line chemotherapy. Data from the files of the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (DBCG) show that with current systemic treatment median survival after distant recurrence is 19 months. Since historical data from the pre-chemotherapy era indicate a median survival of 12 months, the survival benefit of standard chemotherapy appears to be around 7 months in the average patient. The DBCG trial 80-R2 is the largest randomized trial of CAF (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil) versus CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil) in recurrent breast cancer. A review of this study and 6 other similar studies shows that CAF is clearly superior to CMF in terms of better tumor shrinkage, prolonged overall time to progression, and decreased need of secondary therapy. The adverse effects of the two treatments are largely comparable, but CAF causes severe alopecia and is more expensive than CMF. On balance, the existing evidence indicates that CAF rather than CMF should be chosen as first line chemotherapy in recurrent breast cancer.",0
A cooperative randomized controlled study of adjuvant chemoendocrine therapy for breast cancer in Japan.,"A randomized trial was carried out in 55 Japanese institutions to examine the significance of postoperative adjuvant chemoendocrine therapy in Stages II and IIIA breast cancer patients after radical mastectomy. A total of 619 patients were entered from November 1982 to November 1984, of whom 554 were eligible. Patients were administered MMC (13 mg/m2) after surgery, and were randomized by the envelope method into either group A (ftorafur, 400 mg/m2/day; 275 patients), or group B (ftorafur, 400 mg/m2/day, and tamoxifen, 20 mg/day; 279 patients). Treatment was continued for 1 year from postoperative day 7. There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to age, menopausal status, ER status, method of operation, stage, or number of positive lymph nodes. There was also no significant difference between the two groups in the 5-year survival and disease-free survival (DFS) rates (Kaplan-Meier method). Stratification by ER status, nodal status, or menopausal status produced no significant differences between the groups. However, postmenopausal patients and lymph node-positive patients who were also ER-positive showed a significantly higher DFS in group B. Furthermore, group B in ER-positive patients with four or more positive lymph nodes also had a higher survival rate.",1
The analgesic effect of gabapentin and mexiletine after breast surgery for cancer.,"We investigated the analgesic efficacy of mexiletine and gabapentin on acute and chronic pain associated with cancer breast surgery in 75 patients. They were randomized to receive, in a double-blinded manner, mexiletine 600 mg/d, gabapentin 1200 mg/d, or placebo for 10 days. Anesthesia was standardized, and all patients had access to routine postoperative analgesics on demand. The visual analog scale score assessed pain at rest and after movement. Three months later, all patients were interviewed to identify intensity of chronic pain and analgesic requirements. Mexiletine and gabapentin reduced codeine consumed from the second to tenth day by 50% (P = 0.029; P = 0.018 and P = 0.035 for mexiletine versus control and gabapentin versus control comparisons, respectively). Total paracetamol consumption was also reduced during the same time (P = 0.0085; P = 0.007 and P = 0.011 for the mexiletine and gabapentin groups when compared with the control, respectively). Pain at rest and after movement was reduced by both drugs on the third postoperative day. Pain after movement also was reduced by gabapentin between the second and fifth postoperative day. Three months later, the incidence of chronic pain, its intensity, and need for analgesics were not affected by either treatment. However, burning pain was more frequent in the control group (P = 0.033). IMPLICATIONS: Patients undergoing breast surgery for cancer may develop chronic pain. We evaluated the effect of mexiletine and gabapentin on the acute and chronic pain after breast surgery for cancer. Both drugs reduced the postoperative analgesic requirements, and particularly, gabapentin reduced pain after movement. The overall incidence of chronic pain was unaffected except for burning pain.",0
Local control and survival in early breast cancer: the Milan trial.,"From 1973 to 1980, 701 patients with breast cancer measuring less than 2 cm in pathological diameter and with no palpable axillary lymph nodes were randomized to Halsted mastectomy (349) or to ""quadrantectomy"" with axillary dissection and radiotherapy to the ipsilateral breast tissue (QUART) (352). The two groups were comparable in age distribution, size and site of primary tumor; menopausal status; and frequency of axillary metastases. At 8 years, the disease-free survival was 77% for the Halsted patients and 80% for the ""quadrantectomy"" patients, while overall survival was 83% and 85%, respectively. Disease-free and overall survival curves show no difference between the two groups. Breast cancer of small size (less than 2 cm) may be safely treated with conservative treatment. Mutilating operations are not justified.",0
Correlation of microarray-based breast cancer molecular subtypes and clinical outcomes: implications for treatment optimization.,"BACKGROUND: Optimizing treatment through microarray-based molecular subtyping is a promising method to address the problem of heterogeneity in breast cancer; however, current application is restricted to prediction of distant recurrence risk. This study investigated whether breast cancer molecular subtyping according to its global intrinsic biology could be used for treatment customization.METHODS: Gene expression profiling was conducted on fresh frozen breast cancer tissue collected from 327 patients in conjunction with thoroughly documented clinical data. A method of molecular subtyping based on 783 probe-sets was established and validated. Statistical analysis was performed to correlate molecular subtypes with survival outcome and adjuvant chemotherapy regimens. Heterogeneity of molecular subtypes within groups sharing the same distant recurrence risk predicted by genes of the Oncotype and MammaPrint predictors was studied.RESULTS: We identified six molecular subtypes of breast cancer demonstrating distinctive molecular and clinical characteristics. These six subtypes showed similarities and significant differences from the Perou-Sørlie intrinsic types. Subtype I breast cancer was in concordance with chemosensitive basal-like intrinsic type. Adjuvant chemotherapy of lower intensity with CMF yielded survival outcome similar to those of CAF in this subtype. Subtype IV breast cancer was positive for ER with a full-range expression of HER2, responding poorly to CMF; however, this subtype showed excellent survival when treated with CAF. Reduced expression of a gene associated with methotrexate sensitivity in subtype IV was the likely reason for poor response to methotrexate. All subtype V breast cancer was positive for ER and had excellent long-term survival with hormonal therapy alone following surgery and/or radiation therapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy did not provide any survival benefit in early stages of subtype V patients. Subtype V was consistent with a unique subset of luminal A intrinsic type. When molecular subtypes were correlated with recurrence risk predicted by genes of Oncotype and MammaPrint predictors, a significant degree of heterogeneity within the same risk group was noted. This heterogeneity was distributed over several subtypes, suggesting that patients in the same risk groups require different treatment approaches.CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the molecular subtypes established in this study can be utilized for customization of breast cancer treatment.",0
General anesthesia with thoracic paravertebral block for modified radical mastectomy.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of single-injection paravertebral block (PVB) combined with general anesthesia on 24-hour postoperative morphine requirement in patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy (MRM).MATERIAL AND METHOD: 20 patients were randomly assigned into 2 groups. Patients in the control group were given only general anesthesia. Patients in the PVB group received 0.3 ml/kg of 0.5% plain bupivacaine at T4 paravertebral space followed by general anesthesia. Both groups received intravenous morphine patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) device postoperatively. All patients were evaluated at 1 and 24 hours for pain, nausea and vomiting. Twenty-four hour morphine consumption, antiemetics requirement, and overall satisfaction were recorded.RESULTS: Patients with PVB had lower incidence and severity of postoperative pain, nausea and vomiting and other serious complications. No patients were unsatisfied with anesthetic techniques.CONCLUSION: PVB can reduce postoperative opioid requirement, pain, and severity of nausea and vomiting in MRM.",0
Fluvastatin reduces proliferation and increases apoptosis in women with high grade breast cancer.,"The purpose of this study is to determine the biologic impact of short-term lipophilic statin exposure on in situ and invasive breast cancer through paired tissue, blood and imaging-based biomarkers. A perioperative window trial of fluvastatin was conducted in women with a diagnosis of DCIS or stage 1 breast cancer. Patients were randomized to high dose (80 mg/day) or low dose (20 mg/day) fluvastatin for 3-6 weeks before surgery. Tissue (diagnostic core biopsy/final surgical specimen), blood, and magnetic resonance images were obtained before/after treatment. The primary endpoint was Ki-67 (proliferation) reduction. Secondary endpoints were change in cleaved caspase-3 (CC3, apoptosis), MRI tumor volume, and serum C-reactive protein (CRP, inflammation). Planned subgroup analyses compared disease grade, statin dose, and estrogen receptor status. Forty of 45 patients who enrolled completed the protocol; 29 had paired Ki-67 primary endpoint data. Proliferation of high grade tumors decreased by a median of 7.2% (P = 0.008), which was statistically greater than the 0.3% decrease for low grade tumors. Paired data for CC3 showed tumor apoptosis increased in 38%, remained stable in 41%, and decreased in 21% of subjects. More high grade tumors had an increase in apoptosis (60 vs. 13%; P = 0.015). Serum CRP did not change, but cholesterol levels were significantly lower post statin exposure (P < 0.001). Fluvastatin showed measurable biologic changes by reducing tumor proliferation and increasing apoptotic activity in high-grade, stage 0/1 breast cancer. Effects were only evident in high grade tumors. These results support further evaluation of statins as chemoprevention for ER-negative high grade breast cancers.",0
Long-term prognosis of breast cancer patients with 10 or more positive lymph nodes treated with CMF.,"The purpose of this investigation was to study the long-term prognosis of breast cancer patients with 10 or more positive lymph nodes after conventional chemotherapy treatment with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF). Between 1984 and 1989, 1048 node-positive patients were treated with CMF in two separate trials conducted by the German Breast Cancer Study Group (GBSG). Subgroups either received radiotherapy or tamoxifen in addition. In this study, long-term prognosis in the subgroup of 141 patients with 10 or more positive lymph nodes was investigated. Univariate and multivariate Cox models were used to evaluate the effect of prognostic factors on event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). Both univariate and multivariate analyses revealed the progesterone receptor (PR) status as the dominating prognostic factor for both EFS and OS, resulting in a strongly increased risk of more than 2-fold for receptor-negative patients. A large number of positive lymph nodes also affected the prognosis for EFS. In univariate analysis, the degree of lymph node involvement (i.e. percentage of positive nodes out of all examined nodes), oestrogen status (ER) status, and tumour grade also showed significant effects. To conclude, the prognosis in the subgroup of patients with 10 or more positive lymph nodes is heterogeneous. Some surprisingly high survival rates have been observed in case series of breast cancer patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy which may be explained by patient selection. From the usual factors investigated in this study, the PR status showed the strongest effect, and, at least this factor should be taken into account in the design and analysis of trials for breast cancer patients with a poor prognosis.",0
"Longer therapy, iatrogenic amenorrhea, and survival in early breast cancer.","BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy regimens that combine anthracyclines and taxanes result in improved disease-free and overall survival among women with operable lymph-node-positive breast cancer. The effectiveness of concurrent versus sequential regimens is not known.METHODS: We randomly assigned 5351 patients with operable, node-positive, early-stage breast cancer to receive four cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by four cycles of docetaxel (sequential ACT); four cycles of doxorubicin and docetaxel (doxorubicin-docetaxel); or four cycles of doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and docetaxel (concurrent ACT). The primary aims were to examine whether concurrent ACT was more effective than sequential ACT and whether the doxorubicin-docetaxel regimen would be as effective as the concurrent-ACT regimen. The secondary aims were to assess toxic effects and to correlate amenorrhea with outcomes in premenopausal women.RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 73 months, overall survival was improved in the sequential-ACT group (8-year overall survival, 83%) as compared with the doxorubicin-docetaxel group (overall survival, 79%; hazard ratio for death, 0.83; P=0.03) and the concurrent-ACT group (overall survival, 79%; hazard ratio, 0.86; P=0.09). Disease-free survival was improved in the sequential-ACT group (8-year disease-free survival, 74%) as compared with the doxorubicin-docetaxel group (disease-free survival, 69%; hazard ratio for recurrence, a second malignant condition, or death, 0.80; P=0.001) and the concurrent-ACT group (disease-free survival, 69%; hazard ratio, 0.83; P=0.01). The doxorubicin-docetaxel regimen showed noninferiority to the concurrent-ACT regimen for overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.82 to 1.14). Overall survival was improved in patients with amenorrhea for 6 months or more across all treatment groups, independently of estrogen-receptor status.CONCLUSIONS: Sequential ACT improved disease-free survival as compared with doxorubicin-docetaxel or concurrent ACT, and it improved overall survival as compared with doxorubicin-docetaxel. Amenorrhea was associated with improved survival regardless of the treatment and estrogen-receptor status. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00003782.)",1
Ten-year results of a comparison of conservation with mastectomy in the treatment of stage I and II breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Breast-conservation therapy for early-stage breast cancer is now an accepted treatment, but there is still controversy about its comparability with mastectomy. Between 1979 and 1987, the National Cancer Institute conducted a randomized, single-institution trial comparing lumpectomy, axillary dissection, and radiation with mastectomy and axillary dissection for stage I and II breast cancer. We update the results of that trial after a median potential follow-up of 10.1 years. METHODS: Two hundred forty-seven patients with clinical stage I and II breast cancer were randomly assigned to undergo either modified radical mastectomy or lumpectomy, axillary dissection, and radiation therapy. The 237 patients who actually underwent randomization have been followed for a median of 10.1 years. The primary end points were overall survival and disease-free survival. RESULTS: At 10 years overall survival was 75 percent for the patients assigned to mastectomy and 77 percent for those assigned to lumpectomy plus radiation (P = 0.89). Disease-free survival at 10 years was 69 percent for the patients assigned to mastectomy and 72 percent for those assigned to lumpectomy plus radiation (P = 0.93). The rate of local regional recurrence at 10 years was 10 percent after mastectomy and 5 percent after lumpectomy plus radiation (P = 0.17) after recurrences successfully treated by mastectomy were censored from the analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In the management of stage I and II breast cancer, breast conservation with lumpectomy and radiation offers results at 10 years that are equivalent to those with mastectomy.",0

Patient outcomes after axillary lymph node dissection for breast cancer: use of postoperative continuous local anesthesia infusion.,"BACKGROUND: Although considered a safe surgical procedure, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is associated with postoperative numbness, paresthesias, pain, and muscle weakness. Despite meticulous surgical technique and the absence of long thoracic or thoracodorsal nerve injury, the risk of these complications are reported as great as 35% to 50%, with a subset of patients developing chronic pain syndromes. METHODS: Female patients (n = 27) undergoing Level I-II ALND for breast cancer were recruited. After ALND, patients were randomized to three groups. Group 1 received standard axillary lymph node dissection. Patients assigned to group 2 or 3 (double-blinded) received 120 h continuous 0.9% saline solution or 0.5% bupivacaine using a catheter placed into the axilla and delivered by an elastomeric pump device. After routine postoperative care, patients were discharged with oral opioid analgesics. Twice-daily assessment of pain, sedation, and nausea were conducted using validated visual-analog scale measures. Daily and total opioid analgesic requirements after surgery were recorded. RESULTS: Patients treated with a continuous infusion of bupivacaine experienced significantly lower pain scores (P < 0.001) during the first 5 postoperative days. Postoperative opioid analgesic requirements also were significantly decreased in the bupivacaine group, and these effects persisted until postoperative day 14 (P < 0.001). Concomitant to the observed decreases in pain and oral opioid requirements, nausea and morning sedation also were significantly reduced. There were no pump-related complications, wound infections, or postoperative axillary fluid collections. CONCLUSIONS: The use of continuous administration of bupivicaine after ALND significantly decreases pain and opioid analgesic requirements, with concomitant decreases in nausea and sedation. This study provides encouraging evidence of the therapeutic benefits of continuous infusion of local anesthesia and may represent a valuable adjunct for surgical patients who require ALND, including those with breast cancer and melanoma.",0
A comparison of the antiemetic efficacy and safety of intramuscular and intravenous formulations of granisetron in patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy.,"A total of 120 patients were treated with granisetron either intramuscular (i.m.) or intravenous (i.v.) in a crossover design, over two successive cycles of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. Of the 117 patients evaluable for efficacy, 74.4% receiving i.m. and 76.9% receiving i.v. treatment experienced a complete response (no vomiting, no more than mild nausea, no need for rescue medication and no study withdrawal in the 24 h following the onset of chemotherapy). Only a small proportion of the patients experienced any vomiting, either during the first 24 h or in the follow-up period of 4-10 days. There were no statistically significant differences in any of the efficacy parameters between the two routes administration of granisetron. Both formulations of granisetron were also equally well tolerated. The main treatment-related adverse effects were headache and constipation (experienced by 13-15% of patients); local reactions to i.m. injection of granisetron were experienced by 2.6% of patients.",0

"Economic evaluation of taxane-based first-line chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer in Greece: an analysis alongside a multicenter, randomized phase III clinical trial.","BACKGROUND: An economic evaluation was undertaken alongside a randomized phase III trial comparing three regimens for metastatic breast cancer (MBC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Trial resource utilization and unit price data were combined to evaluate the cost of chemotherapy, concomitant medications, hospitalizations, diagnostic and laboratory tests. Treatment cost was combined with survival to estimate the incremental cost per life year saved. Quality-of-life data were used to estimate cost per quality-adjusted life year saved. Sensitivity analysis was used to compute results for various subgroups and for discounting cost and effects. RESULTS: The combination of gemcitabine (Gemzar, Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, USA) with docetaxel (Taxotere, Aventis Pharma, Dagenham, UK) (GDoc) is the least costly but least effective treatment. The combination of paclitaxel (Taxol) with carboplatin (Paraplatin, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, USA) is associated with higher cost and effectiveness compared with GDoc, while weekly paclitaxel (Pw), associated with the highest cost, is the most effective option. The incremental cost per life year saved of Pw versus GDoc was 3660 Euros (95% uncertainty interval dominance-9261). This result remained fairly constant in sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The corresponding economic evaluation indicates that Pw represents an attractive treatment option for patients with MBC from an economic perspective in the context of the Greek National Health Service.",0
Continued breast cancer risk reduction in postmenopausal women treated with raloxifene: 4-year results from the MORE trial. Multiple outcomes of raloxifene evaluation.,"Raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator approved for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, has shown a significant reduction in breast cancer incidence after 3 years in this placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. This article includes results from an additional annual mammogram at 4 years and represents 3,004 additional patient-years of follow-up in this trial. Breast cancers were ascertained through annual screening mammograms and adjudicated by an independent oncology review board. A total of 7,705 women were enrolled in the 4-year trial; 2,576 received placebo, 2,557 raloxifene 60 mg/day, and 2,572 raloxifene 120 mg/day. Women were a mean of 66.5-years old at trial entry, 19 years postmenopause, and osteoporotic (low bone mineral density and/or prevalent vertebral fractures). As of 1 November 1999, 61 invasive breast cancers had been reported and were confirmed by the adjudication board, resulting in a 72% risk reduction with raloxifene (relative risk (RR) 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17, 0.46). These data indicate that 93 osteoporotic women would need to be treated with raloxifene for 4 years to prevent one case of invasive breast cancer. Raloxifene reduced the risk of estrogen receptor-positive invasive breast cancer by 84% (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.09, 0.30). Raloxifene was generally safe and well-tolerated, however, thromboembolic disease occurred more frequently with raloxifene compared with placebo (p=0.003). We conclude that raloxifene continues to reduce the risk of breast cancer in women with osteoporosis after 4 years of treatment, through prevention of new cancers or suppression of subclinical tumors, or both. Additional randomized clinical trials continue to evaluate this effect in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, at risk for cardiovascular disease, and at high risk for breast cancer.",0
"Weekly cisplatin, epirubicin, and paclitaxel with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support vs triweekly epirubicin and paclitaxel in locally advanced breast cancer: final analysis of a sicog phase III study.","The present study aimed at evaluating whether a weekly cisplatin, epirubicin, and paclitaxel (PET) regimen could increase the pathological complete response (pCR) rate in comparison with a tri-weekly epirubicin and paclitaxel administration in locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) patients. Patients with stage IIIB disease were randomised to receive either 12 weekly cycles of cisplatin 30 mg m(-2), epirubicin 50 mg m(-2), and paclitaxel 120 mg m(-2) (PET) plus granulocyte-colony stimulating factor support, or four cycles of epirubicin 90 mg m(-2)+paclitaxel 175 mg m(-2) (ET) every 3 weeks. Overall, 200 patients (PET/ET=100/100) were included in this study. A pCR in both breast and axilla occurred in 16 (16%) PET patients and in six (6%) ET patients (P=0.02). The higher activity of PET was evident only in ER negative (27.5 vs 5.4%; P=0.026), and in HER/neu positive (31 vs 5%; P=0.037) tumours. The two arms yielded similar pCR rate in ER positive (PET/ET=7.5/7.1%) and HER/neu negative (PET/ET=10/6%) patients. At a 39 months median follow-up, 70 patients showed a progression or relapses (PET, 32 vs ET, 38). Anaemia, mucositis, peripheral neuropathy, and gastrointestinal toxicity were substantially more frequent in the PET arm. The PET weekly regimen is superior to ET in terms of pCR rate in LABC patients with ER negative and/or HER2 positive tumours Mature data in terms of disease-free and overall survival are needed to ascertain whether this approach could improve the prognosis of these subsets of LABC patients.",1
Prognostic and predictive impact of the HER-2/ neu extracellular domain (ECD) in the serum of patients treated with chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: The extracellular domain of the HER-2/neu -receptor (ECD) is shed from the receptor protein and can be detected in serum. However, the clinical implication of HER-2/neu ECD measurement must be further evaluated. METHODS: In patients with metastatic breast cancer participating in a trial on first-line chemotherapy, the association of serum HER-2/neu ECD with progression-free interval, survival, and response was studied. Blood samples of patients receiving epirubicin and either cyclophosphamide (EC) or paclitaxel (ET) were collected before (n = 103) and in addition, after three courses of therapy (n = 46). RESULTS: HER-2/neu ECD levels correlate with HER-2/neu overexpression of corresponding primary tumors determined by immunohistochemistry (antibody CB11, p = 0.018) with an optimized cut-off at 15 ng/mL. Elevated serum levels of HER-2/neu ECD before chemotherapy were correlated with shorter overall survival (p = 0.0097), but not with reduced progression-free survival and response to chemotherapy. In subgroup analyses, patients with elevated pretherapeutic HER-2/neu ECD levels treated with EC showed shorter overall survival (p = 0.0092); no difference was seen in the ET group. With regard to progression-free survival, patients with elevated HER-2/neu ECD levels tended to benefit from ET (p = 0.0341), in patients with low levels no difference was observed between EC and ET. A decrease of HER-2/neu ECD levels after three courses of therapy was associated with response to therapy (p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: In our group of metastatic breast cancer patients, elevated HER-2/neu ECD levels are associated with decreased overall survival. With regard to progression-free survival, particularly patients with high HER-2/neu ECD levels seem to benefit from taxane-containing chemotherapy.",0
"Bendamustine prolongs progression-free survival in metastatic breast cancer (MBC): a phase III prospective, randomized, multicenter trial of bendamustine hydrochloride, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (BMF) versus cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) as first-line treatment of MBC.","Two i.v. regimens, bendamustine, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (BMF) and cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) were compared as first-line therapy in a randomized, open, multicenter phase III trial including 364 patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Bendamustine is an anti-neoplastic agent with alkylating, but also additional, so far unclear, mechanisms of action. We wanted to show the superiority of BMF over CMF in terms of time to progression (TTP) (primary endpoint), overall response, response duration, toxicity and quality of life (QoL). TTP was significantly longer in the BMF group (8.2 versus 6.7 months for CMF) (p=0.0071). The effect of BMF on TTP was more pronounced in the stratum 'prior adjuvant therapy, no visceral metastases' (p=0.034). Overall response rates and QoL did not significantly differ between the regimens. BMF caused more mucositis and leukopenias. Thus, bendamustine, when replacing cyclophosphamide in the CMF combination, can be expected to produce longer progression-free survival in first-line treatment of MBC.",1
"Primary chemotherapy in operable breast carcinoma comparing CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil) with an anthracycline-containing regimen: short-term responses translated into long-term outcomes.","BACKGROUND: The role of anthracyclines has been extensively studied in adjuvant chemotherapy, but much less in the primary chemotherapy of early breast carcinoma. This study, comparing CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil) with the rotational anthracycline-containing regimen CMFEV (CMF plus epirubicin and vincristine) administered as primary chemotherapy, demonstrated a significant increase in clinical complete response in premenopausal women. We report the long-term results. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and eleven patients with stage I or II palpable breast carcinoma and a tumour diameter of >2.5 cm were randomised to receive CMF or CMFEV for four cycles before surgery. After surgery, the patients in both arms received adjuvant CMF for three cycles. RESULTS: In the study population as a whole, there was a non-significant 20% reduction in mortality and relapse rates in the CMFEV arm. However, the effect of the experimental regimen was only found in premenopausal patients, especially in terms of relapse-free survival (P=0.07) and locoregional relapse-free survival (P=0.0009), thus mirroring the effect on response rates. After 10 years, the proportions of premenopausal patients free from locoregional relapse as a first event in the CMF and CMFEV groups were 68% and 97%, respectively. No relevant differences were found in postmenopausal patients. CONCLUSION: The overall results of this study showed that the greater activity of the experimental anthracycline-containing combination over CMF as primary chemotherapy in premenopausal patients translated into long-term effects in the same subgroup.",1
Long-term effects of adjuvant tamoxifen and/or radiotherapy. The South Sweden Breast Cancer Trial.,"In a multicenter trial of adjuvant therapy in stage II breast cancer, 719 postmenopausal patients were randomized to one of three treatment regimens: radiotherapy only or in combination with adjuvant tamoxifen for one year, or adjuvant tamoxifen without radiotherapy. At twelve years of follow-up (median 9 years), no statistically significant differences in survival or recurrence-free survival were observed. However, the rate of loco-regional recurrency was lower among patients treated with both radiotherapy and tamoxifen. The rate of bilateral breast cancer was reduced in tamoxifen-treated patients whereas the rate of new primary malignancies other than breast cancer was somewhat higher in tamoxifen-treated patients. Adjuvant therapy in breast cancer may influence not only breast cancer recurrences and mortality but also later disease patterns and cause-specific mortality.",1
Once-daily use of ofloxacin for prophylaxis in breast cancer surgery.,"The 150 consecutive patients who were hospitalized for breast cancer at our department between September 1992 and November 1995 were enrolled in this open study after having given their informed consent. Patients were assigned randomly to receive ofloxacin in daily doses of 200 mg to be taken in a single dose or a total dose of 600 mg divided into three doses postoperatively for 5 days. Ten patients (8 found to be without malignancies) were excluded from evaluation. Wound infections developed in 8 (12%) of the 69 patients in the 200-mg group and 12 (17%) of the 71 patients in the 600-mg group. Postoperative wound care lasted a median of 19 days (25th and 75th percentiles, 15 and 29 days) for patients given 200 mg and 16 days (13 and 25 days) for those given 600 mg; the difference was not statistically significant (Wilcoxon's U test). Signs or symptoms suggesting ofloxacin toxicity were not observed, and several significant differences were found in laboratory test results between the two groups both before and after treatment. Abnormal changes after treatment were found in many individuals, but the rate of occurrence was similar in the two groups (U test). When ofloxacin is used for prophylaxis after breast surgery, we recommend a once-daily administration of 200 mg orally for financial reasons and increased patient compliance.",0
"Tamoxifen and chemotherapy for axillary node-negative, estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer: findings from National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-23.","PURPOSE: Uncertainty about the relative worth of doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC) and cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/fluorouracil (CMF), as well as doubt about the propriety of giving tamoxifen (TAM) with chemotherapy to patients with estrogen receptor-negative tumors and negative axillary nodes, prompted the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project to initiate the B-23 study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (n = 2,008) were randomly assigned to CMF plus placebo, CMF plus TAM, AC plus placebo, or AC plus TAM. Six cycles of CMF were given for 6 months; four cycles of AC were administered for 63 days. TAM was given daily for 5 years. Relapse-free survival (RFS), event-free survival (EFS), and survival (S) were determined by using life-table estimates. Tests for heterogeneity of outcome used log-rank statistics and Cox proportional hazards models to detect differences across all groups and according to chemotherapy and hormonal therapy status. RESULTS: No significant difference in RFS, EFS, or S was observed among the four groups through 5 years (P =.96,.8, and.8, respectively), for those aged < or = 49 years (P =.97,.5, and.9, respectively), or for those aged > or = 50 years (P =.7,.6, and.6, respectively). A comparison between all CMF- and all AC-treated patients demonstrated no significant differences in RFS (87% at 5 years in both groups, P =.9), EFS (83% and 82%, P =.6), or S (89% and 90%, P =.4). There were no significant differences in RFS, EFS, or S between CMF and AC in patients aged < or = 49 or > or = 50 years. No significant difference in any outcome was observed when chemotherapy-treated patients who received placebo were compared with those given TAM. RFS in both groups was 87% (P =.6), 87% in patients aged < or = 49 (P =.9), and 88% and 87%, respectively (P =.4), in those aged > or = 50 years. CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference in the outcome of patients who received AC or CMF. TAM with either regimen resulted in no significant advantage over that achieved from chemotherapy alone.",1
Levamisole in the treatment of advanced breast cancer. A ten-year follow-up of a randomized study.,"A total of 101 patients with advanced breast cancer were treated during the years 1976 to 1978 with doxorubicin, vincristine and cyclophosphamide, and randomized to receive either levamisole or placebo in a double-blind fashion. The chemotherapy cycles were repeated every four weeks, and levamisole, 2.5 mg/kg, was given on two consecutive days every week except on the days chemotherapy was given. The patients treated with levamisole exhibited higher response rates (63%) than patients given placebo (47%). The survival rate was also significantly higher in the levamisole group. The results correlated with potentiation of intracutaneous PPD test. In the lymphocyte blast transformation tests, the suppression of T-cell response to mitogens two weeks after the start of chemotherapy was markedly diminished by levamisole. In contrast to some negative reports, the results of the present study are encouraging for further evaluation of levamisole and other biological response modifiers in breast cancer.",0
Second and third line hormonotherapy in advanced post-menopausal breast cancer: a multicenter randomized trial comparing medroxyprogesterone acetate with aminoglutethimide in patients who have become resistant to tamoxifen.,"In order to evaluate the efficacy of two different sequences of second and third line hormonotherapy in advanced post-menopausal breast cancer, 257 women aged 36-91 years (mean age: 63.6 years) who had become resistant to tamoxifen (TAM), entered into a multicenter randomized trial comparing two different regimens: 1) Aminoglutethimide (Ag) 500 mg/day with hydrocortisone supplementation from 30 to 60 mg/day; and 2) oral medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 500 mg twice a day. 250 patients were evaluated following second line hormone therapy and, after cross-over, 128 following third line hormonotherapy. No significant difference was observed, during either second or third line therapies, for toxicity, survival, or response rate; however, in both second and third line therapies the median time to progression was significantly longer with Ag therapy.",1
"Randomized, open-label, phase II trial of oral capecitabine (Xeloda) vs. a reference arm of intravenous CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil) as first-line therapy for advanced/metastatic breast cancer.","BACKGROUND: Oral capecitabine was evaluated in terms of overall response rate, safety, and tolerability as first-line therapy in women aged > or = 55 years with advanced/metastatic breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-five patients were randomized (2:1) to either intermittent oral capecitabine 1,255 mg/m2 twice daily (two weeks' treatment followed by a one-week rest period) or intravenous CMF (cyclophosphamide. methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil [5-FU]) administered every three weeks. RESULTS: The overall response rate in the capecitabine group was 30% (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 19%-43%), including three complete responses (5%). The response rate observed in the CMF group was 16% (95% CI: 5%-33%), with no complete responses. Median time to disease progression was 4.1 months with capecitabine and 3.0 months with CME. Survival was similar in the two treatment groups (median 19.6 months with capecitabine. 17.2 months with CMF). The safety profiles were different for capecitabine and CMF. However, both regimens were generally well tolerated and treatment interruption and/or dose modification was effective in managing toxicities associated with capecitabine. Alopecia and myelosuppression were rare in patients receiving capecitabine while diarrhea and hand-foot syndrome were more common. Treatment interruption and/or individual dose adjustment of capecitabine was required in 34% of patients and was generally effective in managing adverse events. Treatment was stopped owing to toxicity in 16% of patients in the capecitabine arm. The incidence of deaths during or within 28 days of stopping study treatment was 8% and 6% in the capecitabine and CMF arms, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: An oral, twice-daily regimen of capecitabine is effective and well tolerated when used as first-line chemotherapy in older patients (> or = 55 years) with advanced/metastatic breast cancer, and is suitable for outpatient therapy.",1
A daily diary for quality of life measurement in advanced breast cancer trials.,"The Qualitator is a daily diary card to measure Quality of Life, developed for use in chemotherapy trials for patients with advanced breast cancer. In a trial at King's College Hospital, 29 patients completed the Qualitator and their scores were compared with scores in the Linear Analogue Self-Assessment and Nottingham Health Profile taken four-weekly. In a separate study at Guy's Hospital, 31 patients completed the diary. The Qualitator offers accurate prognostic data regarding subsequent UICC response and survival and is simple to use.",0
Oral high-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate treatment for recurrent breast cancer.,"Oral high-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) treatment (600, 800, 1200 mg/day or changed dosage) was given to 49 patients with recurrent breast cancer from January 1979 to December 1992. The overall response rate to MPA was 38.8% (19/49). The response rate in the soft tissue was significantly higher compared with that in bone metastases or in visceral metastases. MPA was effective on patients both with or without previous treatment. Several side effects were recognized, but they were mild and tolerable. These results demonstrate that MPA is effective when used as first line or second line treatment.",1
"Double-blind, randomised, controlled study of the efficacy and tolerability of palonosetron plus dexamethasone for 1 day with or without dexamethasone on days 2 and 3 in the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by moderately emetogenic chemotherapy.","BACKGROUND: To reduce side-effects of corticosteroid-containing antiemetic regimens, tailoring antiemetic schedules to specific requirements of different patients could be of benefit. We evaluated the possibility to reduce the total dose of corticosteroids when palonosetron, a long-acting second-generation 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT(3)) receptor antagonist, is used. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Double-blind, multicentre, noninferiority study of chemotherapy-naive breast cancer patients receiving 0.25 mg palonosetron and 8 mg dexamethasone on day 1, randomly assigned to receive placebo (n = 151) or 4 mg b.i.d. dexamethasone (n = 149) on days 2 and 3. Primary end point was complete response (CR) rate (no emesis, no rescue medication) in the overall (days 1-5) period. Secondary end points were CR rates in the acute (day 1) and delayed (days 2-5) periods, rates of no emesis and no nausea and impact on daily functioning (Functional Living Index-Emesis). RESULTS: Noninferiority between the two treatments was demonstrated by similar CR rates (P = 0.487) in the overall period. Most parameters showed that palonosetron and dexamethasone on day 1 only offer chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting protection similar to multiple-day dexamethasone administration. CONCLUSION: In patients treated with a single injection of palonosetron on day 1, reducing dexamethasone is an option that is not associated with significant reduction in antiemetic control during the 5-day period or an impact on patient functioning.",0
A double blind comparative study of tegafur (FT) and UFT (a combination of Tegafur and uracil) in advanced breast cancer.,"A double blind study to compare the efficacy of oral UFT (400 mg Tegafur (FT) plus 896 mg uracil/day) with that of oral FT (800 mg/day) on advanced breast cancer was performed between November, 1986, and November, 1989. Sixty patients were registered for the trial and fifty-six cases were evaluated (28 for UFT and 28 for FT). The primary end points in the study were response rate and time to relapse. There were no significant differences in patients' characteristics in either group. The objective response rates were 39% (11/28; 95% confidence interval (C.I.), 22-59%) in UFT and 21% (6/28; 95% C.I., 8-41%) in FT, without statistical significance (P = 0.25). For time to relapse, a trend was seen in favor of UFT, but this effect did not achieve statistical significance (P = 0.09). Both subjective and objective adverse effects were similar between the two treatments. The overall survivals were similar in both parts of the study. The size of the trial was too small for a definite conclusion to be drawn although, for both response rate and time to relapse, a trend was seen in favor of UFT. A large scale randomized study will be necessary to compare the drugs in the management of patients with advanced breast cancer.",1
Results of endocrine therapy do not predict response to chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer.,"One hundred and four patients with advanced breast cancer treated with adriamycin +/- vincristine had had prior endocrine therapy. Of 28 responders to prior endocrine therapy a response to subsequent chemotherapy occurred in 15 (54%); the response frequency in the 76 non-responders to endocrine therapy was 51% (39 patients). The median time to treatment failure was not significantly different between responders to prior endocrine treatment and non-responders (7 months vs 5 months; P = 0.136). Although the median survival from starting chemotherapy tended to be longer in the endocrine responders (18 months) than in the non-responders (12 months), there was no significant difference between the two groups (chi = 2.749; P = 0.097). In a subgroup of 31 non-responders to endocrine therapy who had had stable disease (greater than or equal to 6 months) the median time to treatment failure was 6 months and median survival 13 months. This lack of differences existed for each subgroup of endocrine therapy. Response to prior endocrine treatment was not shown to be a determinant of response to subsequent chemotherapy.",0
Long-term impact of chemotherapy-induced ovarian failure on bone mineral density (BMD) in premenopausal breast cancer patients. The effect of adjuvant clodronate treatment.,"We present the 5-year results of the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy on bone mineral density (BMD) and the efficacy of clodronate in the prevention of bone loss in 73 premenopausal women with primary breast cancer. All patients were treated with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil (CMF) chemotherapy. The patients were randomised to oral clodronate 1600 mg daily for 3 years or to a control group. At 5 years, patients were divided into those with preserved menstruation and those with amenorrhoea. Changes in BMD correlated significantly with the menstrual function after chemotherapy. The change in the lumbar spine BMD at 3 and 5 years were +0.6 and -1.3% in the menstruating group and -7.5 and -10.4% in the amenorrhoeic group (P=0.0001 and 0.0001, respectively), and in femoral neck +1.7 and -0.3%, and -3.5 and -5.8% (P=0.002 and P=0.001, respectively). Three-year clodronate treatment significantly reduced the bone loss in the lumbar spine -3.0% compared with controls -7.4% at three years (P=0.003), but no significant difference was found in the femoral neck: -1.7% versus -2.8%, respectively (P=0.86). These differences between the study groups were still seen at 5 years: in the lumbar spine -5.8% versus -9.7% (P=0.008) and femoral neck -3.5% versus -5.1% (P=0.91). In conclusion, chemotherapy-induced ovarian failure in premenopausal women caused a temporary accelerated bone loss of the lumbar spine. Adjuvant clodronate treatment significantly reduced this bone loss. Two years after the termination of treatment, the bone loss was still significantly less in the clodronate group compared with the control group.",0
Offering the option of randomized clinical trials to cancer patients who overestimate their prognoses with standard therapies.,"We have shown that cancer patients' routine (and understandable) overestimations of their prognoses with standard therapy may inhibit their accrual to randomized clinical trials for which standard therapies are the alternative. Patients' appreciation of the rationale for a trial, and the potential benefit of trial participation, can only be enhanced if they understand their prognoses with standard therapy. However, clinical investigators may be reluctant to provide specific information that deflates patients' estimates of their prognoses. The routine withholding of information regarding the modest benefits of standard therapies may avoid patient distress, but such physician behavior is paternalistic and may deleteriously affect trial accrual. On the other hand, the routine communication of prognostic information will cause significant distress among patients and will perhaps be destabilizing to that minority of patients who would otherwise shun this information or truly cannot psychologically tolerate it. A middle ground between these extremes is the stepwise disclosure of potentially distressing information, wherein specific prognostical information is offered by physicians to patients and actually provided or communicated only after patients first understand the nature of it and then indicate their interest in receiving it. A practical disadvantage of this approach is its additional demand on physicians' time. Therefore, if impracticality is to be avoided and yet the approach fostered, clinical investigators might consider developing trial-specific, written or audiovisual materials for patient education about general background information. These could be employed prior to patient-physician dialogue and so enable physicians to focus on more sensitive subjects, such as prognosis with standard therapy.",0
Adjuvant endocrine therapy plus zoledronic acid in premenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer: 5-year follow-up of the ABCSG-12 bone-mineral density substudy.,"BACKGROUND: The Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group trial-12 (ABCSG-12) bone substudy assesses zoledronic acid for preventing bone loss associated with adjuvant endocrine therapy and reports on long-term findings of bone-mineral density (BMD) during 3 years of treatment and 2 years after completing adjuvant treatment with or without zoledronic acid. The aim of this substudy is to gain insight into bone health in this setting. METHODS: ABCSG-12 is a randomised, open-label, phase III, 4-arm trial comparing tamoxifen (20 mg/day orally) and goserelin (3.6 mg subcutaneously every 28 days) versus anastrozole (1 mg/day orally) and goserelin (3.6 mg subcutaneously every 28 days), both with or without zoledronic acid (4 mg intravenously every 6 months) for 3 years in premenopausal women with endocrine-responsive breast cancer. This prospective bone subprotocol measured BMD at 0, 6, 12, 36, and 60 months. The primary endpoint of the bone substudy (secondary endpoint in the main trial) was change in BMD at 12 months, assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in assessable patients. Analyses were intention to treat. Statistical significance was assessed by t tests. The ABCSG-12 trial is registered on the ClinicalTrials.gov website, number NCT00295646. FINDINGS: 404 patients were prospectively included in the bone substudy and randomly assigned to endocrine therapy alone (goserelin and anastrozole or goserelin and tamoxifen; n=199) or endocrine therapy concurrent with zoledronic acid (goserelin, anastrozole, and zoledronic acid or goserelin, tamoxifen, and zoledronic acid; n=205). After 3 years of treatment, endocrine therapy alone caused significant loss of BMD at the lumbar spine (-11.3%, mean difference -0.119 g/cm(2) [95% CI -0.146 to -0.091], p<0.0001) and trochanter (-7.3%, mean difference -0.053 g/cm(2) [-0.076 to -0.030], p<0.0001). In patients who did not receive zoledronic acid, anastrozole caused greater BMD loss than tamoxifen at 36 months at the lumbar spine (-13.6%, mean difference -0.141 g/cm(2) [-0.179 to -0.102] vs -9.0%, mean difference -0.095 g/cm(2) [-0.134 to -0.057], p<0.0001 for both). 2 years after the completion of treatment (median follow-up 60 months [range 15.5-96.6]), patients not receiving zoledronic acid still had decreased BMD at both sites compared with baseline (lumbar spine -6.3%, mean difference -0.067 g/cm(2) [-0.106 to -0.027], p=0.001; trochanter -4.1%, mean difference -0.03 g/cm(2) [-0.062 to 0.001], p=0.058). Patients who received zoledronic acid had stable BMD at 36 months (lumbar spine +0.4%, mean difference 0.004 g/cm(2) [-0.024 to 0.032]; trochanter +0.8%, mean difference 0.006 g/cm(2) [-0.018 to 0.028]) and increased BMD at 60 months at both sites (lumbar spine +4.0%, mean difference 0.039 g/cm(2) [0.005-0.075], p=0.02; trochanter +3.9%, mean difference 0.028 g/cm(2) [0.003-0.058], p=0.07) compared with baseline. INTERPRETATION: Goserelin plus tamoxifen or anastrozole for 3 years without concomitant zoledronic acid caused significant bone loss. Although there was partial recovery 2 years after completing treatment, patients receiving endocrine therapy alone did not recover their baseline BMD levels. Concomitant zoledronic acid prevented bone loss during therapy and improved BMD at 5 years.",0
Mitomycin C + high-dose medroxyprogesterone versus cyclophosphamide+doxorubicin plus fluorouracil as first-line treatment for metastatic breast cancer.,"A pilot study was undertaken to compare mitomycin C plus oral high-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate (MMPA) to cyclophosphamide+doxorubicin+ fluorouracil (CAF). Thirty-four women were randomized at first relapse to receive MMPA or CAF. Patients were balanced with respect to age, performance status, hormone receptor status, prior adjuvant treatment, site of metastases, and number of metastatic sites. On MMPA 9/18 objective responses occurred and on CAF 12/18. Median time to treatment failure was 5.7 months on MMPA and 7.6 months on CAF; median survival on MMPA was 22.5 months and on CAF 16.7 months. Although there were more objective responses on CAF, this was not statistically significantly different, and CAF was associated with significantly more hemopoietic toxicity. It is concluded that mitomycin C should be further studied in front-line regimens for patients with metastatic breast cancer.",1
Adjuvant tamoxifen in postmenopausal breast cancer: preliminary results of a randomized trial.,"Between May 1978 and March 1982, 179 postmenopausal women with operable breast cancer were randomized to receive either adjuvant tamoxifen, 40 mg daily for three years (TAM group), or no further treatment (controls). The difference in five-year survival rates (61% in the control group, 72% in the TAM group) was not statistically significant. However, there was a significant improvement in disease-free survival in the TAM group (61%) relative to the controls (44%) (p = 0.008). In estrogen receptor positive patients, tamoxifen improved both the disease-free rate (47% controls, 80% with tamoxifen) and the survival rate (63% to 83%). Similar results were observed in progesterone receptor positive patients. In patients that were estrogen receptor negative, tamoxifen modified neither the survival rate nor the disease-free interval.",1
"Randomized clinical trial of adjuvant fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy for patients with fast-proliferating, node-negative breast cancer.","PURPOSE: The prospective applicability of new biologic tumor information to personalize adjuvant treatment of women with operable breast cancer remains to be demonstrated. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether patients with fast-proliferating, node-negative breast cancer could benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy with fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Beginning in November 1989, we analyzed the proliferative activity of primary tumors in a consecutive series of women with node-negative breast cancer to identify subgroups of patients with a worse prognosis and who were therefore suitable candidates for adjuvant systemic therapy. Proliferative activity was determined by means of the [3H]-thymidine incorporation assay using an autoradiographic technique. Women with fast-proliferating breast cancer ([3H]-thymidine labeling index, > 2.3%) were randomized to receive either six cycles of adjuvant FEC or no adjuvant therapy until disease progression. RESULTS: One-hundred twenty-five and 123 patients treated with radical surgery for pT1 to T2, N0, M0 breast cancer were randomized to the FEC and control arms, respectively. After a median follow-up of 70 months, 27 events (21.6%) were observed in the FEC arm and 39 (32.2%) in the control arm, with a significantly lower number of locoregional relapses in the FEC group. Five-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 81% in the FEC group and 69% in the control group (P <.02 by log-rank test). Cox multivariate analysis described the impact of adjuvant therapy with FEC on DFS as independent of the patients' main clinical-pathologic characteristics. CONCLUSION: FEC adjuvant polychemotherapy seems able to significantly improve the clinical outcome of patients with fast-proliferating, node-negative breast cancer.",1
Adjuvant therapy of breast cancer with docetaxel-containing combination (TAC).,"The adjuvant chemotherapy of breast cancer changed in the past two decades. Docetaxel containing regimens are highly active in metastatic breast cancer. A logical approach was their incorporation into trials of early breast cancer adjuvant therapy. The authors present the Hungarian interim analysis and experience with the BCIRG 001 randomized, multicentric, phase III clinical trial comparing TAC (docetaxel, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide) and FAC (5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide) in the adjuvant treatment of node positive breast cancer patients. The results are presented compared to the international data. Three Hungarian centers - Szt. Margit Hospital, Budapest, National Institute of Oncology, Budapest, Petz Aladár Hospital, Gyôr - participated in the international trial. Between June 1997 and June 1999, 61 patients with node positive breast cancer were enrolled in the study after the surgery. Thirty-four patients were randomized to TAC (75/50/500 mg/m2 6xq3wk) and 27 patients were randomized to FAC (500/50/500 mg/m2 6x q3wk) chemotherapy, with prospective stratification by node (1-3, 4+). Patients with hormone receptor positive tumors received tamoxifen for 5 years after the chemotherapy. Radiotherapy was performed after the 6th cycle of chemotherapy. 33 months of follow up was performed. In both arms the hematological toxicity was more frequent. The TAC group showed a higher incidence of neutropenia (76%) compared to the FAC (22%), as well as a higher incidence of febrile neutropenia (26 % versus none), without grade 3-4 infection and there was no cases of septic death. More grade 3-4 nausea and vomiting was observed in the FAC group. At three years follow up, results indicated improvement in disease-free survival (88% vs. 76%) in favour of TAC, and similar tendency was observed in the case of overall survival (97% vs. 88%). Based on the international data analysis TAC was superior to FAC chemotherapy, the results show statistically significant differences between the two arms. This benefit with TAC was seen regardless of hormone receptor status. Additional follow up data will evaluate the role of TAC in the adjuvant setting of early breast cancer treatment.",0
Comparison of adjuvant chemotherapy with methotrexate and fluorouracil with and without cyclophosphamide in breast cancer patients with one to three positive axillary lymph nodes.,"BACKGROUND: Alkylating agents administered as single agents or in combination with antimetabolites or anthracyclines delay the appearance of metastases and prolong the survival of breast cancer patients after surgery. PURPOSE: This phase III clinical trial was designed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of the alkylating agent cyclophosphamide in combination with the antimetabolites methotrexate and fluorouracil adjuvant to breast cancer surgery. METHODS: This study consisted of 255 breast cancer patients (a) with one to three histologically positive axillary lymph nodes and either no detectable primary tumor or operable primary tumors 5 cm or less (T0-T2) (95% of the patients) or (b) with tumors larger than 5 cm (T3) and with negative axillary nodes. Patients were randomly allocated to receive either methotrexate (60 mg/m2) and fluorouracil (600 mg/m2) (MF) intravenously on days 1 and 8 every 28 days for eight cycles or cyclophosphamide (100 mg/m2) orally on days 1-14 plus MF (CMF) every 28 days for the same duration. Median follow-up was 7.8 years, and maximum follow-up was 13 years. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in time to treatment failure or overall survival for patients treated with MF or CMF. At 8 years after completion of treatment, time to treatment failure was 55% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 50%-60%) and 59% (95% CI = 54%-64%) and overall survival was 69% (95% CI = 65%-73%) and 67% (95% CI = 62%-72%) for MF- and CMF-treated patients, respectively. The hazard ratios (MF to CMF) for time to treatment failure and for survival, estimated with a proportional hazards model, were 1.02 (95% CI = 0.69-1.50) and 0.87 (95% CI = 0.56-1.34), respectively. Myelosuppression was significantly greater (P < .0001) in CMF-treated patients during cycles 1-6. Median white blood cell count nadirs were between 4.4 x 10(3)/microL and 3.5 x 10(3)/microL in patients receiving MF and between 3.0 x 10(3)/microL and 2.4 x 10(3)/microL in those receiving CMF. Dose reductions were more frequent in CMF-treated patients, which led to statistically significant differences (P < .0001) in amounts of methotrexate and fluorouracil administered. Primary cancers at other sites occurred in 14 patients (5.5%)--six treated with MF and eight treated with CMF. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the addition of cyclophosphamide to adjuvant chemotherapy with MF offers no therapeutic advantage but results in increased myelosuppression. IMPLICATIONS: Future trials will define the possible advantages of antimetabolites in adjuvant therapy. Further information will also become available when results of the ongoing National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project trial comparing adjuvant MF to CMF in node-negative breast cancer patients are presented.",1
Preoperative treatment of postmenopausal breast cancer patients with letrozole: A randomized double-blind multicenter study.,"BACKGROUND: A randomized, double-blind, multicenter study was conducted to compare the anti-tumor activity of letrozole vs. tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with ER and/or PgR positive primary untreated breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred thirty-seven postmenopausal women with ER and/or PgR positive primary untreated breast cancer were randomly assigned once daily treatment with either letrozole 2.5 mg or tamoxifen 20 mg for four months. At baseline none of the patients were considered to be candidates for breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and 14% of the patients were considered inoperable. The primary endpoint was to compare overall objective response (CR + PR) determined by clinical palpation. Secondary endpoints included overall objective response on ultrasound and mammography and the number of patients who qualified for BCS. RESULTS: Overall objective response rate (clinical palpation) was statistically significantly superior in the letrozole group, 55% compared to tamoxifen, 36% (P < 0.001). Secondary endpoints of ultrasound response, 35% vs. 25% (P = 0.042), mammographic response, 34% vs. 16% (P < 0.001), and BCS, 45% vs. 35% (P = 0.022) between the letrozole and tamoxifen groups, respectively, showed letrozole to be significantly superior. Both treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that letrozole is more effective than tamoxifen as preoperative therapy in postmenopausal patients with ER and/or PgR positive primary untreated breast cancer and is at least as well tolerated.",1
Evaluating the impact of Relative Total Dose Intensity (RTDI) on patients' short and long-term outcome in taxane- and anthracycline-based chemotherapy of metastatic breast cancer- a pooled analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy dose delay and/or reduction lower relative total dose intensity (RTDI) and may affect short- and long-term outcome of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients.METHODS: Based on 933 individual patients' data of from 3 randomized MBC trials using an anthracycline and taxane we examined the impact of RTDI on efficacy and determined the lowest optimal RTDI for MBC patients.RESULTS: Median time to disease progression (TTDP) and overall survival (OS) of all patients were 39 and 98 weeks. Overall higher RTDI was correlated with a shorter TTDP (log-rank p = 0.0525 for 85% RTDI cut-off). Proportional hazards assumption was violated, there was an early drop in the TTDP-curve for the high RTDI group. It was explained by the fact that patients with primary disease progression (PDP) do have a high RTDI per definition. Excluding those 114 patients with PDP the negative correlation between RTDI and TTDP vanished. However, non-PDP patients with RTDI-cut-off levels <85% showed a shorter OS than patients with higher RTDI levels (p = 0.0086).CONCLUSIONS: Optimizing RTDI above 85% appears to improve long-term outcome of MBC patients receiving first-line chemotherapy. Lowering RTDI had no negative influence on short term outcome like OR and TTDP.",0
"A prospective randomized phase III trial comparing combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, fluorouracil, and either doxorubicin or epirubicin. French Epirubicin Study Group.","Two hundred sixty-three patients with advanced breast cancer were randomized to two treatment regimens consisting of fluorouracil, 500 mg/m2; cyclophosphamide, 500 mg/m2; and either epirubicin (Farmorubicin, Farmitalia Carlo Erba SpA, Italy), 50 mg/m2 (FEC); or doxorubicin (Adriamycin, Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), 50 mg/m2 (FAC), administered intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks. Two hundred thirty patients (FAC, 113; FEC, 117) were evaluable for response, and 244 patients for toxicity (FAC, 120; FEC, 124). The two groups were comparable with respect to age, menopausal status, disease-free interval to first recurrence, time from initial diagnosis to protocol activation, indicator lesions, performance status, and prior adjuvant therapy. Of 117 evaluable patients treated with FEC, 59 (50.4%) had a partial response (PR) or complete response (CR), 40 showed no change (NC), and 18 had progressive disease. Of 113 evaluable patients treated with FAC, 54 (52%) showed a remission, 30 NC, and 18 progression. There was no statistical difference between the two regimens in overall response rate, response rate according to tumor site, time to response, or duration of response. Median survival was 15 months for FEC and 18.2 months for FAC (not significant). In the 120 patients evaluable for toxicity treated with FAC, three episodes of congestive heart failure (CHF) were observed after 225, 350, and 550 mg/m2 of doxorubicin, respectively. Of the 124 evaluable patients treated with FEC, 25 received greater than 600 mg/m2 of epirubicin and no CHF was recorded. FEC induced significantly less neutropenia (P = .01), less nausea and vomiting (P less than .01), and less complete alopecia (P less than 10(-3) than did FAC. The results of this study demonstrate that FEC is as effective a regimen as FAC for the therapy of advanced breast cancer. Moreover, FEC was better tolerated than FAC in this patient population.",1
Physical and psychosocial recovery in the year after primary treatment of breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: The 2000 National Institutes of Health Consensus Conference on Adjuvant Therapy of Breast Cancer recommended chemotherapy for all women with invasive cancer greater than 1 centimeter. Studies of long-term breast cancer survivors have found poorer quality of life (QOL) in women who received adjuvant chemotherapy. The aim of this article is to characterize physical and psychosocial recovery as a function of chemotherapy receipt in the year after medical treatment completion.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective longitudinal survey data (RAND SF-36 and Breast Cancer Prevention Trial [BCPT] Symptom Scales) collected from 558 women with breast cancer enrolled on the Moving Beyond Cancer (MBC) psychoeducational intervention trial were compared according to receipt of chemotherapy. MBC study enrollment occurred within 4 weeks after the end of primary treatment (eg, surgery, chemotherapy, radiation). Self-report questionnaire data collected at enrollment and at 2, 6, and 12 months thereafter were examined, controlling for intervention and with propensity score adjustment for imbalance of covariates. Outcome analyses were carried out by fitting linear mixed models by using SAS PROC MIXED.RESULTS: Longitudinal SF-36 scale scores did not differ by chemotherapy treatment exposure, and both groups improved significantly (P < .01) in the year after primary treatment ended. However, adjuvant chemotherapy treatment was associated with significantly more severe physical symptoms, including musculoskeletal pain (P = .01), vaginal problems (P < .01), weight problems (P = .01), and nausea (P = .03).CONCLUSION: Physical and psychosocial functioning improved significantly after breast cancer treatment, independent of receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy. Women who received chemotherapy experienced more severe and persistent physical symptoms that should be more effectively managed as part of survivorship care.",0
Efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid in patients with breast cancer metastatic to bone: a multicenter clinical trial.,"PURPOSE: This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid in breast cancer patients with newly diagnosed bone metastases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with bone metastases < or = 6 weeks prior to first visit were enrolled. Zoledronic acid (4 mg) was administered via a 15-minute infusion every 3 or 4 weeks for 12 infusions. Skeletal-related events (SREs) were defined as pathologic bone fractures, spinal cord compression, surgery to bone, radiation therapy to bone, and hypercalcemia of malignancy. Primary efficacy end points were the proportion of patients with at least one SRE and the time to first SRE. Secondary end points included pain, analgesic use, and quality of life. RESULTS: Among 312 patients enrolled, 30% experienced at least one SRE during the 12-month study, and 22% experienced only one SRE. The median time to first SRE was not reached in the intent-to-treat population. Mean pain and analgesic scores declined from baseline, and quality-of-life scores remained stable to study end. The most frequently reported adverse events, regardless of relationship to study drug, were pyrexia (22%) and bone pain (10%). Serum creatinine levels did not significantly increase from baseline throughout the study. CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer patients with newly diagnosed bone metastases who were treated with zoledronic acid had a low incidence of SREs compared with patients who received placebo in randomized phase III trials, and pain was decreased from baseline. This study demonstrated the favorable risk:benefit ratio of zoledronic acid for the prevention of skeletal complications.",0
Response to tamoxifen and fluoxymesterone in a group of breast cancer patients with disease recurrence after cessation of adjuvant tamoxifen.,"The response to tamoxifen or a combination of tamoxifen and fluoxymesterone was assessed in 54 postmenopausal breast cancer patients with recurrent disease. The patients had originally been entered in a randomized trial of 2 years of tamoxifen (40 mg daily), as an adjunct to primary surgery, versus no adjuvant endocrine therapy. The objective response rate (complete + partial) to the mentioned salvage endocrine therapies was significantly lower among patients from the tamoxifen group as compared to the controls (14% vs 54%; P less than 0.01). Their median time to disease progression was also significantly shorter (4 vs 15 months; P less than 0.05). Differences between the groups in regard to prognostic factors could not explain these differences. The lower response rate to these endocrine treatments was possibly one reason for the poorer survival outlook after relapse observed among the patients previously treated with adjuvant tamoxifen. An increased relapse-free survival achieved with adjuvant therapy may thus to some extent be offset by a poorer survival after relapse.",0
Randomized trial of tamoxifen versus tamoxifen plus aminoglutethimide as adjuvant treatment in postmenopausal breast cancer patients with hormone receptor-positive disease: Austrian breast and colorectal cancer study group trial 6.,"PURPOSE: To determine whether the addition of aminoglutethimide to tamoxifen is able to improve the outcome in postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive, early-stage breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 2,021 postmenopausal women were randomly assigned to receive either tamoxifen for 5 years alone or tamoxifen in combination with aminoglutethimide (500 mg/d) for the first 2 years of treatment. Tamoxifen was administered at 40 mg/d for the first 2 years and at 20 mg/d for 3 years. RESULTS: All randomized and eligible patients were included in the analysis according to the intention-to-treat principle. After a median follow-up of 5.3 years, the 5-year disease-free survival in the aminoglutethimide plus tamoxifen group was 83.6% versus 83.7% in the monotherapy group (P =.89). The corresponding data for overall survival at 5 years were 91.4% and 91.2%, respectively (P =.74). More patients failed to complete combination treatment (13.7%) because of side effects as compared to tamoxifen alone (5.2%; P =.0001). CONCLUSION: Aminoglutethimide given for 2 years in addition to tamoxifen for 5 years does not improve the prognosis of postmenopausal patients with receptor-positive, lymph node-negative or lymph node-positive breast cancer.",1
Mechanism of action of adjuvant chemotherapy in early breast cancer.,"The relation between tumour oestrogen and progesterone receptor status, menstrual status, relapse-free survival, and overall survival was analysed in 411 patients with early breast cancer randomised to receive either postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) or no additional treatment (control). Prolongation of time to recurrence and survival was seen predominantly in premenopausal patients; these effects were seen only with tumours positive for steroid receptors, particularly progesterone. Chemotherapy led to permanent amenorrhoea in 61% of premenopausal patients. The therapeutic effects of chemotherapy were seen only when CMF induced permanent amenorrhoea in premenopausal patients. These findings support the hypothesis that the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy in early breast cancer may be mediated by ovarian suppression.",0
Effect of cognitive-existential group therapy on survival in early-stage breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: Cognitive-existential group therapy (CEGT) was developed to improve mood and mental attitude toward cancer in women with early-stage breast cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. Given the debate about group therapy's association with increased survival in women with metastatic breast cancer, we were curious to check its effect at a much earlier stage in the cancer journey. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We randomly assigned 303 women with early-stage breast cancer who were receiving adjuvant chemotherapy to either 20 sessions of weekly group therapy plus three relaxation classes (n = 154) or to a control condition of three relaxation classes alone (n = 149). The primary outcome was survival. RESULTS: CEGT did not extend survival; the median survival time was 81.9 months (95% CI, 64.8 to 99.0 months) in the group-therapy women and 85.5 months (95% CI, 67.5 to 103.6 months) in the control arm. The hazard ratio for death was 1.35 (95% CI, 0.76 to 2.39; P = .31). In contrast, histology and axillary lymph node status were significant predictors of survival. Low-grade histology yielded a hazard ratio of 0.342 (95% CI, 0.17 to 0.69), and axillary lymph node-negative status yielded a hazard ratio of 0.397 (95% CI, 0.20 to 0.78). CONCLUSION: CEGT does not prolong survival in women with early-stage breast cancer.",0
Taxol: initial Israeli experience with a novel anticancer agent.,"Taxol is a novel taxane derivative obtained from the bark of the Pacific yew, Taxus brevifolia, which has demonstrated substantial antitumor activity in early clinical trials. Intensive research efforts were necessary to overcome both supply problems and hypersensitivity reactions to the drug and thus assure its widespread use. Taxol is active in a variety of neoplasias, including advanced breast and ovarian tumors resistant to drugs such as doxorubicin and cisplatin, respectively. We report here the initial experience with taxol in these two disease entities in Israel, at three institutions within the framework of large multinational trials. These studies compared a) the use of two dose levels of taxol, and b) short, 3-h administration vs. a longer 24-h infusion of the drug. A total of 107 Israeli patients, 38 with ovarian cancer and 69 with breast cancer, were given 706 courses of taxol. Our results show that the administration of taxol at doses ranging between 135 and 175 mg/m2 is indeed feasible and that 3-h infusions are as well tolerated as longer administration. The main hematological toxicity was leukopenia, which was promptly reversible and was more pronounced both at the higher dose level and with the more prolonged infusion. Of the nonhematological side effects, the most prominent were alopecia, mild nausea and vomiting, limb paresthesias, fatigue and myalgia. Allergic reactions following routine premedication were mild and infrequent, never necessitating discontinuation of the drug. Clinically significant cardiac events did not occur. Taxol is an important addition to the anticancer chemotherapy armamentarium.",1
Hydrocortisone alone vs hydrocortisone plus aminoglutethimide: a comparison of the endocrine effects in postmenopausal breast cancer.,"The endocrine effects of replacement doses of hydrocortisone in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer were compared with the same doses of hydrocortisone plus aminoglutethimide. Fifteen patients received aminoglutethimide (AG) 250 mg three times a day plus hydrocortisone (HC) 20 mg twice a day for 2 weeks, then AG was increased to 250 mg four times a day. Another 13 patients received HC alone for 2 weeks, then AG was added. HC alone significantly suppressed oestrone (75% of baseline) and oestradiol (50% of baseline). Addition of AG to these patients produced further oestrone suppression (50% of baseline) significantly greater than HC alone. HC alone suppressed dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate as much as AG + HC. delta 4-androstenedione (delta 4A) and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHA) were suppressed by HC alone. Addition of AG produced a rise of delta 4A to basal levels. These results show that 3-beta-ol de hydrogenase is not induced by AG. AG plus HC together from day 1 produced significantly greater oestrone suppression (50% of baseline) than HC alone. Because high-dose steroids may induce aromatase and replacement doses produced marked peripheral endocrine effects, the use of replacement hydrocortisone should be reassessed in advanced breast cancer.",1
"Randomized trial to compare the efficacy and toxicity of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) with methotrexate mitoxantrone (MM) in advanced carcinoma of the breast.","One hundred and sixteen patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive CMF (cyclophosphamide 600 mg m(-2) day 1 and 8 i.v., 5-fluorouracil 600 mg m(-2) day 1 and 8 i.v., methotrexate 40 mg m(-2) day 1 and 8 i.v., monthly for 6 cycles) or MM (methotrexate 30 mg m(-2), mitoxantrone 6.5 mg m(-2), both i.v. day 1 3-weekly for 8 cycles) as first line treatment with chemotherapy. Objective responses occurred in 17 patients out of 58 (29%) who received CMF and nine out of 58 (15%) who received MM; 95% confidence interval for difference in response rates (-1%-29%), P = 0.07. No statistically significant differences were seen in overall survival or time to progression between the two regimes although a tendency towards a shorter progression time on the MM regime must be acknowledged. There was, however, significantly reduced haematological toxicity (P < 0.001) and alopecia (P < 0.001) and fewer dose reductions and delays in patients randomized to MM. No statistically significant differences were seen between the two regimes in terms of quality of life (QOL). However, some association between QOL and toxicity was apparent overall with pooled QOL estimates tending to indicate a worsening in psychological state with increasing maximum toxicity over treatment. Despite the fact that results surrounding response rates and time to progression did not reach statistical significance, their possible compatibility with an improved outcome on CMF treatment must be borne in mind. However, MM is a well-tolerated regimen with fewer side-effects than CMF, which with careful patient management and follow-up, therefore, may merit consideration as a first-line treatment to palliate patients with metastatic breast cancer who are infirm or elderly.",1
Postoperative adjuvant use of carmofur for early breast cancer.,"OBJECTIVE: The efficacy of oral fluoropyrimidine carmofur was evaluated for adjuvant use for breast cancer. METHODS: 150 patients with breast cancer of T0N1, T1, N1, T2N0, and T2N1 were randomized to 100 for carmofur and 50 for carboquone. Both drugs were administered continuously for 28 days cyclically for 5 years with a cessation period of 28 days for carmofur and 56 days for carboquone. RESULTS: Overall survival excluding non-breast cancer death was 90% for the carmofur group and 88% for the carboquone group, adjusted by Cox's regression analysis. Difference in drug never affected survival. Leukocyte count was decreased in the carboquone group, but no change in serum transaminase was found in either group. Ten patients, 5 for carmofur and 5 for carboquone, suffered from second malignancy, more than expected in the normal population, but difference in the cumulative rate of each group was not significant. CONCLUSION: Adjuvant use of carmofur as well as carboquone is beneficial for early breast cancer.",1
"Plasma letrozole concentrations in postmenopausal women with breast cancer are associated with CYP2A6 genetic variants, body mass index, and age.","The associations between plasma letrozole concentrations and CYP2A6 and CYP3A5 genetic variants were tested in the Exemestane and Letrozole Pharmacogenomics (ELPH) trial. ELPH is a multicenter, open-label prospective clinical trial in women randomly assigned (n≈250 in each arm) to receive 2 years of treatment with either oral letrozole (2.5 mg/day) or oral exemestane (25 mg/day). CYP2A6 and CYP3A showed effects on letrozole metabolism in vitro. DNA samples were genotyped for variants in the CYP2A6 and CYP3A5 genes. Plasma letrozole concentrations showed high interpatient variability (>10-fold) and were associated significantly with CYP2A6 genotypes (P<0.0001), body mass index (BMI) (P<0.0001), and age (P=0.0035). However, CYP3A5 genotypes showed no association with plasma letrozole concentrations. These data suggest that CYP2A6 is the principal clearance mechanism for letrozole in vivo. CYP2A6 metabolic status, along with BMI and age, may serve as a biomarker of the efficacy of letrozole treatment or a predictor of adverse effects.",0
Response to chemotherapy is a major parameter-influencing long-term survival of metastatic breast cancer patients.,"BACKGROUND: In cancer patients, correlation between response to chemotherapy and gain in survival remains debated. We addressed this question in a multivariate analysis evaluating response to chemotherapy as a factor influencing survival of patients with metastatic breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1977 to 1992, 1430 patients included in eight consecutive prospective trials of anthracycline-based first-line chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer, were available for assessment. Median follow-up was 155 months. RESULTS: Median survival from the date of randomisation was 24 months. Objective response rate was 63.6%. A complete response (CR) was achieved in 17% (249 patients). In a stepwise forward progression analysis objective response was the first independent prognostic factor for survival. Median survival time was 43 months for complete responders (CR), 29 months for partial responders (PR), 18 months for stable disease (SD), 5 months for progressive disease (PD). The probability of survival at 5 and 10 years was 35% and 15% for CR's and decreased to 18% and 6% for PR's. The timing of best response (at 4 or 8 months) was not related to outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Response to an anthracycline-based chemotherapy is a major independent prognostic factor in metastatic breast cancer. The use of this factor to investigate new drugs seems to be pertinent. The good prognosis of complete responders justifies further evaluation of new treatment strategies for this patient population.",0
Intravenous ibandronate reduces the incidence of skeletal complications in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases.,"BACKGROUND: This phase III study compared the efficacy of the new potent bisphosphonate, ibandronate, with placebo as intravenous (i.v.) therapy in metastatic bone disease due to breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 466 patients were randomised to receive placebo (n = 158), or 2 mg (n = 154) or 6 mg (n = 154) ibandronate every 3-4 weeks for up to 2 years. The primary efficacy parameter was the number of 12-week periods with new bone complications, expressed as the skeletal morbidity period rate (SMPR). Bone pain, analgesic use and safety were evaluated monthly. Results SMPR was lower in both ibandronate groups compared with the placebo group; the difference was statistically significant for the ibandronate 6 mg group (P = 0.004 versus placebo). Consistent with the SMPR, ibandronate 6 mg significantly reduced the number of new bone events (by 38%) and increased time to first new bone event. Patients on ibandronate 6 mg also experienced decreased bone pain scores and analgesic use. Treatment with ibandronate was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that 6 mg i.v. ibandronate is effective and safe in the treatment of bone metastases from breast cancer.",0
Cell kinetics of CD34-positive hematopoietic cells following chemotherapy plus colony-stimulating factors in advanced breast cancer.,"Bone-marrow (BM) hematopoietic precursors are recruited into proliferative activity when colony-stimulating factors (CSF) are sequenced with chemotherapy (CT). Previous studies suggested that further CT can be safely administered only when the increased proliferative activity of these cells has subsided, because most cytostatic drugs selectively damage cycling cells. The safest interval between CSF discontinuation and the start of the next CT course needs to be ascertained in vivo. Thirty patients with advanced breast cancer were treated with an intensified FEC regimen, planned at 21-day intervals, sequenced with granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF (15 patients) or granulocyte (G)-CSF (15 patients). Using flow cytometry (FCM) we evaluated the proliferation kinetics of CD34+ BM hematopoietic progenitors before CT+CSF and at different times after CSF administration was stopped. FEC+GM- and FEC+G-CSF sequences both induced a rapid and sustained increase in the percentage of BM myeloid precursors (BMMP%) and in the cycling status of CD34+BM cells. However, while the BMMP% remained elevated in both cases after CSF were stopped, the enhanced proliferative activity of CD34+ cells decreased more rapidly after GM- than after G-CSF. Using FCM, CD34+ BM-derived hematopoietic presursor cell kinetics is readily evaluated in the clinical setting. The administration of CSF following CT increases both the proliferative activity of CD34+ BM cells and the BMMP%. After CSF were discontinued a kinetic refractoriness of hematopoietic progenitors was more evident after GM-CSF than after G-CSF. These data may be of value in designing clinical trials to avoid cytostatic damage to the BM hematopoietic stem-cell compartment.",0
A two-by-two factorial trial comparing oral with transdermal estrogen therapy and fenretinide with placebo on breast cancer biomarkers.,"PURPOSE: Oral conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) increase breast cancer risk, whereas the effect of transdermal estradiol (E2) and MPA is less known. Fenretinide may decrease second breast malignancies in premenopausal women but not in postmenopausal women, suggesting a hormone-sensitizing effect. We compared the 6 and 12-month changes in insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), IGF-I:IGFBP-3 ratio, sex-hormone binding-globulin, and computerized mammographic percent density during oral CEE or transdermal E2 with sequential MPA and fenretinide or placebo. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A total of 226 recent postmenopausal healthy women were randomly assigned in a two-by-two factorial design to either oral CEE 0.625 mg/day (n = 111) or transdermal E2, 50 microg/day (n = 115) and to fenretinide 100 mg/twice a day (n = 112) or placebo (n = 114) for 12 months. Treatment effects were investigated by the Kruskall-Wallis test and analysis of covariance. P values were two-sided. RESULTS: After 12 months, oral CEE decreased IGF-I by 26% [95% confidence interval (CI), 22-30%] and increased sex-hormone binding-globulin by 96% (95% CI, 79-112%) relative to baseline, whereas no change occurred with transdermal E2 (P < 0.001 between groups). Fenretinide decreased IGFBP-3 relative to placebo (P = 0.04). Percentage of breast density showed an absolute increase of 3.5% (95% CI, 2.5-4.6%) during hormone therapy without differences between groups (P = 0.39). CONCLUSIONS: Oral CEE has more favorable changes than transdermal E2 on circulating breast cancer risk biomarkers but gives similar effects on mammographic density. Fenretinide exerted little modulation on most biomarkers. The clinical implications of these findings require additional studies.",0
Disease-free survival according to degree of HER2 amplification for patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy with or without 1 year of trastuzumab: the HERA Trial.,"PURPOSE: To determine whether (1) immunohistochemical (IHC) HER2 status (ie, 2+ or 3+), (2) degree of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) amplification according to (2a) HER2/CEP17 ratio or (2b) HER2 gene copy number, or (3) polysomy significantly influenced clinical outcome for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -positive breast cancer enrolled in the Herceptin Adjuvant trial of trastuzumab versus no trastuzumab administered after completion of chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: IHC and/or FISH analyses were performed locally and required central confirmation as indicating HER2 positivity for trial entry. FISH data from the central HER2 analysis on patients in the 1-year trastuzumab and no trastuzumab arms were assessed in relation to disease-free survival (DFS) after a median 2 years of follow-up. RESULTS: Central FISH results were available for 2,071 (61%) of the 3,401 patients randomized to the 2 arms. Among patients with FISH-positive disease, (1) the hazard ratios for trastuzumab versus no trastuzumab were 0.56 (95% CI, 0.32 to 0.99) for locally IHC2+ cases (n = 340) and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.40 to 1.61) for centrally IHC2+ cases (n = 299). There was no significant prognostic relationship between (2a) HER2 FISH ratio, (2b) HER2 copy number, or (3) polysomy and DFS in the control arm or predictive relationship defining differential benefit from trastuzumab. CONCLUSION: There was no evidence for reduced benefit of trastuzumab in HER2 IHC2+FISH+ cases. The degree of HER2 amplification does not influence prognosis or benefit from adjuvant trastuzumab in patients treated with prior adjuvant chemotherapy.",0
Adjuvant tamoxifen versus placebo in elderly women with node-positive breast cancer: long-term follow-up and causes of death.,"PURPOSE: This study analyzes the long-term results and causes of death in elderly women with node-positive breast cancer who participated in a double-blind adjuvant trial that compared tamoxifen with placebo to determine the benefit of 2 years of treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred eighty-one women 65 to 84 years old were given 20 mg of tamoxifen or placebo daily for 2 years after stratification by estrogen receptor status, tumor size, and degree of lymph node involvement. Approximately 30% of patients were older than 70 years and 20% were older than 75 years. Eighty-five percent were estrogen receptor-positive. Median follow-up was 10 years. RESULTS: Among the 168 eligible patients, there have been 98 recurrences (59 placebo v 39 tamoxifen), with reduced distant and bone-only first sites in patients treated with tamoxifen. Median time to failure was 4.4 years for placebo versus 7.4 years for tamoxifen (log-rank P = .001). A similar number of new nonbreast cancers occurred in each arm (seven placebo v six tamoxifen), but a reduced number of opposite-breast cancers (five placebo v one tamoxifen) was noted. Overall, there were 102 deaths (57 placebo v 45 tamoxifen). Median survivals were 8.0 years with placebo and 8.5 years with tamoxifen (log-rank P = .063); 50% of the tamoxifen patients and 33% of the placebo patients are still alive. Sixty-one percent of the deaths were reported to have been caused by breast cancer recurrence, 4% by other cancers, and 22% by the sequelae of non-cancer-related illness, with equal distributions for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. There was no increase in the number of endometrial or other types of cancer, or thrombotic or orthopedic complications in this older group. CONCLUSION: Tamoxifen currently is the treatment of choice for elderly women with breast cancer. It extends the time to treatment failure by 3 years and reduces the number of recurrences, deaths, distant and bone-only first recurrences, and second breast cancers.",1

Chemotherapy of metastatic breast cancer in the elderly. The Piedmont Oncology Association experience [see comment].,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of age on treatment outcome in women with metastatic breast cancer treated with chemotherapy. DESIGN: Case-comparison study of patients with metastic breast cancer treated in five clinical trials of the Piedmont Oncology Association. SETTING: University and private practice physicians participating in the Piedmont Oncology Association clinical trials in the southeastern United States. PATIENTS: Seventy patients 70 years of age or older were compared with 60 patients aged 50 through 69 years and 40 patients less than 50 years of age. All patients were ambulatory or capable of self-care, with adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic function. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment with multidrug chemotherapy regimens. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Response to treatment, time to disease progression, survival, and toxic effects. RESULTS: Pretreatment characteristics including race, performance status, disease-free interval, prior therapy, sites of metastatic disease, and number and dominant sites of metastases were similar for the three age groups. The response rates for the younger-than-50, 50-through-69, and 70-or-older age groups were 40%, 31%, and 29%, respectively (P = .53). There were no significant differences in time to disease progression or survival for patients in the three age groups. Estimates for time to progression and survival were 9.1 and 17.9 months, 6.2 and 12.8 months, and 7.2 and 14.2 months, respectively. Toxic effects, dose delivery, and dose delays were also similar for all three age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Women 70 years of age or older who were enrolled in these trials were similar to their younger counterparts in response rates, time to disease progression, survival, and toxic effects. Women in this age group should not be excluded, based on age alone, from clinical trials involving chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer.",0
Study participation improves treatment strategies and individual patient care in participating centers.,"BACKGROUND: The ADEBAR study is a prospective multicenter Phase III trial to examine whether high-risk breast cancer patients > or =4 involved axillary lymph nodes) benefit from a sequential anthracycline-docetaxel regimen compared to standard chemotherapy with anthracyclines. With a median recruitment of 33 patients per month at 198 actively-recruiting centers, the ADEBAR study was the best recruiting study in Germany until the end of the trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A standardized questionnaire was sent to all participating centers in order to determine the extent to which treatment strategies and patient care are affected by participation in the ADEBAR study. The questionnaire covered 5 areas of interest: previous inclusion of patients at the same tumor stage in other studies, the type of chemotherapy received by comparable patients previously outside the study, change in the intensity of medical care since participating in the ADEBAR study, the information gained through participation in the study and changes in the overall quality of medical care. RESULTS: 51.0% (n=98) of the questionnaires were returned, from which 3 were excluded from the analysis due to being incomplete. In the year preceding the ADEBAR study, 63.2% of participating centers had not entered their high-risk patients into a clinical trial. Before participating in the ADEBAR protocol, 44.2% of patients with the same indication had received inadequate therapy by today's standards, such as CMF, EC/CMF or 4x EC. 59.0% of the centers noted an increase in the intensity of patient care as a result of participation in the study, independent of the care provided purely because of the study. By being part of a research network, with a regular flow of information via newsletters, study meetings and the like, 80.0% noted an improvement in their professional knowledge in the field of breast cancer. Moreover, 31.6% of the centers reported an improvement in the overall quality of their patient care since the start of the trial. CONCLUSION: The results of the survey demonstrate that both physicians and patients benefit from participation in clinical trials as this is associated with optimized decision-making as regards therapy and patient care.",0

"Feasibility and tolerability of sequential doxorubicin/paclitaxel followed by cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil and its effects on tumor response as preoperative therapy.","PURPOSE: The European Cooperative Trial in Operable breast cancer (ECTO) randomly tested whether efficacy of adjuvant doxorubicin followed by i.v. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF; doxorubicin-->CMF, arm A) could be improved by adding paclitaxel (doxorubicin/paclitaxel-->CMF) as adjuvant (arm B) or primary systemic therapy (PST, arm C). We report here feasibility, tolerability, locoregional antitumor activity, and breast conservation rate. METHODS: A total of 1,355 women entered the study. Feasibility and safety were compared in arm A versus arms B plus C. Surgical findings were compared in arms A plus B versus arm C. RESULTS: Grade 3 or 4 National Cancer Institute toxicities were low (<5%) in all arms. Neuropathy was more frequent in the paclitaxel-containing arms (grade 2, 20.5% versus 5.0%; grade 3, 1.3% versus 0.2%). At 31 months of follow-up, asymptomatic drop of left ventricular ejection fraction was similar in all arms, whereas symptomatic cardiotoxicity was recorded in three patients (0.5%) in A and in three patients (0.3%) in B plus C. PST induced clinical complete plus partial remission in 78%, with an in-breast pathologic complete response rate of 23% and an in-breast plus axilla pathologic complete response rate of 20%. In the multivariate analysis, only estrogen receptor (ER) status was significantly associated with pathologic complete response (odds ratio for ER negative, 5.77; 95% confidence interval, 3.49-9.52; P<0.0001). PTS induced a significant axillary downstaging (P<0.001), and breast sparing surgery was feasible in 65% versus 34% (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Doxorubicin/paclitaxel-->CMF is feasible, safe, and well tolerated. Given as PST, it is markedly active, allowing for breast-sparing surgery in a large fraction of patients.",1
"The cognitive sequelae of standard-dose adjuvant chemotherapy in women with breast carcinoma: results of a prospective, randomized, longitudinal trial.","BACKGROUND: Retrospective trials have reported that chemotherapy-induced cognitive dysfunction was experienced by a subset of patients with breast carcinoma. However, recent evidence indicated that a subset also exhibited impaired cognitive function at baseline, before the start of chemotherapy. A prospective, longitudinal trial that incorporates baseline neuropsychologic evaluations is necessary to determine to what extent cognitive dysfunction is attributable to chemotherapy in this population. METHODS: Eighteen women with breast carcinoma underwent a comprehensive neuropsychologic evaluation before treatment and at short-term and long-term intervals after chemotherapy. The incidence, nature, severity, and chronicity of cognitive dysfunction developing in patients with breast carcinoma treated with a standard dose of adjuvant chemotherapy were assessed. RESULTS: Before the start of systemic therapy, 33% of women in the current cohort exhibited cognitive impairment. At the short-term postchemotherapy time point, 61% of the cohort exhibited a decline relative to baseline in 1 or more domains of cognitive functioning and reported greater difficulty in maintaining their ability to work. The most common domains of cognitive dysfunction were related to attention, learning, and processing speed. At the long-term postchemotherapy time point, approximately 50% of patients who experienced declines in cognitive function demonstrated improvement, whereas 50% remained stable. Self-reported ability to perform work-related activities also improved over this interval. Neither impairment at baseline nor subsequent treatment-related cognitive decline exhibited any statistically significant correlation with affective well-being or with demographic or clinical characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: The current study is the first longitudinal trial to report evidence of an association between cognitive dysfunction and chemotherapy in a subgroup of women with nonmetastatic breast carcinoma. The importance of using prospective research designs, appropriate cognitive measures, and statistical methods to evaluate subgroup effects was discussed. Identification of mechanisms associated with cognitive dysfunction and of risk factors contributing to subgroup vulnerability is necessary.",0
Cardiac and thromboembolic morbidity among postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer in a randomized trial of adjuvant tamoxifen. The Stockholm Breast Cancer Study Group.,"BACKGROUND: Tamoxifen, which binds to estrogen receptors, is widely used as adjuvant therapy after surgery for early-stage breast cancer. Our previous randomized trial of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy for breast cancer showed a significant decrease of new, contralateral breast cancers in patients who received tamoxifen. Tamoxifen may also influence risk factors for cardiac and thromboembolic disease (e.g., serum cholesterol and antithrombin III). PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess morbidity from cardiac and thromboembolic disease among 2365 postmenopausal patients with early-stage breast cancer in the Stockholm randomized trial of adjuvant tamoxifen (40 mg daily for 2 or 5 years) versus no adjuvant endocrine therapy. Patients were entered in the study from November 1976 through December 1988. METHODS: In our retrospective study, the analysis of morbidity was based on data from a computerized, population-based register of hospital admissions and discharge diagnoses. Mortality data were obtained from the Swedish National Central Bureau of Statistics. In the Stockholm study, treatment with tamoxifen was initiated within 4-6 weeks of modified radical mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery including axillary lymph node dissection and postoperative radiation therapy to the breast. In that randomized trial, 755 patients at low risk of death from breast cancer received adjuvant tamoxifen only; 760 received no treatment. In addition, 628 high-risk patients were randomly assigned to receive adjuvant chemotherapy plus tamoxifen (173 patients) or postoperative radiotherapy plus tamoxifen (151) or, as a control, to receive chemotherapy (171) or postoperative radiation therapy (133), both without tamoxifen or other endocrine therapy. Median follow-up was 6 years. RESULTS: Tamoxifen therapy resulted in a statistically significant reduced incidence of hospital admissions due to cardiac disease. The relative hazard (tamoxifen for 2 or 5 years versus control) was 0.68 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.48-0.97; P = .03). In the randomized comparison of 5 versus 2 years of tamoxifen, there was a statistically significant difference favoring the longer treatment (relative hazard = 0.37; 95% CI = 0.15-0.92; P = .03). There was little difference between the tamoxifen and control groups in terms of admissions due to thromboembolic disease. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that long-term adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen may result in substantial reduction of cardiac morbidity in patients with low risk of death from breast cancer as well as in women in chemopreventive studies who have high risk of developing breast cancer. IMPLICATIONS: Our results support continuation of ongoing trials of tamoxifen therapy in these two groups of subjects.",0
Superior efficacy of letrozole versus tamoxifen as first-line therapy for postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer: results of a phase III study of the International Letrozole Breast Cancer Group.,"PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of tamoxifen with that of letrozole, an oral aromatase inhibitor, with tamoxifen as first-line therapy in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nine hundred seven patients were randomly assigned letrozole 2.5 mg once daily (453 patients) or tamoxifen 20 mg once daily (454 patients). Patients had estrogen receptor- and/or progesterone receptor-positive tumors, or both receptors were unknown. Recurrence during adjuvant antiestrogen therapy or within the following 12 months or prior endocrine therapy for advanced disease precluded enrollment. One prior chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease was allowed. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP). Secondary end points included overall objective response rate (ORR), its duration, rate and duration of clinical benefit, time to treatment failure (TTF), overall survival, and tolerability. RESULTS: TTP was significantly longer for letrozole than for tamoxifen (median, 41 v 26 weeks). Treatment with letrozole reduced the risk of progression by 30% (hazards ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.82, P =.0001). TTP was significantly longer for letrozole irrespective of dominant site of disease, receptor status, or prior adjuvant antiestrogen therapy. Similarly, TTF was significantly longer for letrozole (median, 40 v 25 weeks). ORR was higher for letrozole (30% v 20%; P =.0006), as was the rate of clinical benefit (49% v 38%; P =.001). Survival data are currently immature and not reported here. Both treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Letrozole was significantly superior to tamoxifen in TTP, TTF, ORR, and clinical benefit rate. Our results support its use as first-line endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer.",1
"A double-blind, multicenter, parallel-group study of paroxetine, desipramine, or placebo in breast cancer patients (stages I, II, III, and IV) with major depression.","OBJECTIVE: This study compared the efficacy and safety of paroxetine and desipramine with those of placebo in the treatment of depressive disorders in adult women with breast cancer, stages I-IV. METHOD: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 35 female outpatients with breast cancer and DSM-III-R major depression or adjustment disorder with depressed mood were randomly assigned to treatment with paroxetine (N=13), desipramine (N=11), or placebo (N=11) for 6 weeks. Primary efficacy was assessed by change from baseline in score on the 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), and the secondary outcome measure was change from baseline in the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale (CGI-S) score. RESULTS: Mean changes in the total HAM-D and CGI-S scores from baseline to 6-week endpoint for the paroxetine and desipramine groups were not significantly different than those for the placebo-treated group. An unusually high rate of response (defined as >or=50% improvement in the HAM-D score) in the placebo group was observed (55% [N=6]); adverse events precipitated patient discontinuation in the active treatment groups (9% [N=1] for desipramine, 15% [N=2] for paroxetine) similar to that in the placebo-treated patients (18% [N=2]). Improvement on symptom dimensions within the HAM-D and Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (depressive, anxiety, cognitive, neurovegetative, or somatic) was also similar between groups. CONCLUSION: The small number of women in this study most likely contributed to the lack of observed differences in efficacy observed during the 6 weeks of treatment. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials of adequate power seeking to determine efficacy of antidepressants in the United States for the treatment of women with breast cancer and comorbid depression remain of paramount importance.",0

Post-treatment tumor gene expression signatures are more predictive of treatment outcomes than baseline signatures in breast cancer.,"OBJECTIVE: Tumor gene expression signatures have been used to classify, prognosticate, and predict chemotherapy sensitivity in breast cancer, although almost all efforts have been focused on the unchallenged baseline tumor. Most cancer patients receive systemic therapy, and exposure to drug may modify the tumor's short-term and long-term outcomes. Drug-induced tumor gene signatures may thus be more predictive of treatment outcomes than the unperturbed tumor gene signatures. METHODS: Using a set of 47 breast cancer patients, we obtained paired prechemotherapy and postchemotherapy tumor biopsies and developed gene panels of baseline tumor (T1), postchemotherapy tumor (T2), and chemotherapy-induced relative change signatures (TDelta) to predict pathological response and progression-free survival (PFS). The signatures were validated in two independent test sets with paired prechemotherapy and postchemotherapy tumor samples, comprising of 18-20 patients each. RESULTS: T2 and TDelta were superior to T1 signatures in predicting for PFS (area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic 0.770 and 0.660 vs. 0.530) and pathological response (area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic 0.631 and 0.462 vs. 0.446) in the validation sets. In multivariate analysis for PFS with other clinical predictors, T2, but not T1, signatures remained as significant independent predictors. CONCLUSION: Postchemotherapy tumor gene signatures outperformed baseline signatures and clinical predictors in predicting for pathological response and PFS, independent of clinical and pathological response to chemotherapy. Drug-induced tumor gene signatures may be more informative than unchallenged signatures in predicting treatment outcomes. These findings challenge the current practice of relying only on the baseline tumor to predict outcome, which overlooks the contributions of therapeutic interventions.",0
p53 protein accumulation and response to adjuvant chemotherapy in premenopausal women with node-negative early breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: Thirty percent of women with node-negative breast cancer will have a recurrence within 10 years after diagnosis. Molecular markers may identify those patients and predict whether they benefit from adjuvant therapy. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) conducted a randomized trial (EORTC 10854) to compare perioperative treatment with one course of fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) versus no further therapy. We studied tumors from premenopausal patients with node-negative breast cancer randomized in this trial to determine whether p53 accumulation, c-erbB-2 expression, percentage of Ki-67-positive cells, estrogen receptor (ER-immunoassay [IA]), progesterone receptor (PR-IA), and angiogenesis could be used as prognostic factors and predictors of responsiveness to adjuvant chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Paraffin-embedded tumor specimens from 441 premenopausal women with node-negative breast cancer were collected from the larger EORTC trial. Paraffin sections from the tumors were analyzed for immunohistochemical expression of p53, c-erbB-2, Ki-67, ER, PR, and angiogenesis. RESULTS: Patients with p53-negative tumors showed a significant benefit from perioperative chemotherapy (P < .01), whereas patients who had p53-positive tumors did not (P = .80). At a median follow-up time of 49 months, univariate analyses for disease-free survival (DFS) failed to show prognostic value for p53, c-erbB-2 and angiogenesis. Both univariate and multivariate results showed Ki-67 positivity, ER-IA negativity, and a younger age to be associated with a worse prognosis. CONCLUSION: p53 accumulation was associated with a poor response to one perioperative course of FAC chemotherapy. Ki-67, ER-IA, and age are important prognostic factors in premenopausal women with node-negative breast cancer.",0
"Topical corticosteroid therapy for acute radiation dermatitis: a prospective, randomized, double-blind study.","BACKGROUND: Radiation dermatitis is a common side-effect of radiation therapy, but there is no current consensus about its appropriate therapy. OBJECTIVES: To compare treatment with topical 0.1% methylprednisolone vs. 0.5% dexpanthenol in a cohort of patients undergoing fractionated radiation therapy for breast cancer. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind design, treatment was initiated at the beginning of radiation therapy and continued for 2 weeks after termination of radiation. Outcomes were compared by three different measures: clinical (symptom score), functional (transepidermal water loss, TEWL) and subjective (quality of life, QOL). RESULTS: In a preliminary cohort of untreated patients undergoing radiation therapy, clinical signs and TEWL levels increased progressively during radiation therapy, reaching highest values at 5 and 4 weeks, respectively. Although neither topical treatment reduced the incidence of radiation dermatitis, both delayed the emergence of greatest clinical and TEWL scores until approximately 6 and 5 weeks, respectively. With topical corticosteroids, clinical symptoms and TEWL were less pronounced than with dexpanthenol. Whereas general QOL improved after completion of radiation therapy, skin-related QOL declined. However, the skin-related QOL decline could be at least in part reversed by use of topical corticosteroid vs. dexpanthenol-containing emollient. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that prophylactic and ongoing use of topical therapy with either topical corticosteroid or a dexpanthenol-containing emollient ameliorates, but does not prevent radiation dermatitis. Our data suggest, but do not prove, a benefit of a topical corticosteroid vs. a dexpanthenol-containing emollient. Further controlled studies with larger cohorts will be needed to determine optimal forms of topical therapy for radiation dermatitis.",0
Adjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide or CMF in premenopausal women with stage II breast cancer.,"After total mastectomy and partial axillary dissection, 805 premenopausal women with stage II breast cancer were randomized to receive postoperative radiotherapy (RT) alone, RT + cyclophosphamide (C) for 12 monthly cycles, or RT + cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/5-fluorouracil (CMF) for 12 monthly cycles. At 3 years actuarial relapse-free survival for RT + C and RT + CMF was significantly better than for RT alone (p = 0.0009 and 0.0001, respectively). There was no significant difference in relapse-free survival between RT + C and RT + CMF. C resulted in more pronounced haematologic toxicity and a higher frequency of amenorrhoea and of alopecia than CMF, while CMF resulted in more pronounced nausea and stomatitis than C. In the preliminary results, C alone may be as effective as CMF in prolonging relapse-free survival in premenopausal women with stage II breast cancer.",1
"Preoperative chemotherapy is safe in early breast cancer, even after 10 years of follow-up; clinical and translational results from the EORTC trial 10902.","INTRODUCTION: The Preoperative Chemotherapy in Primary Operable Breast Cancer (POCOB) study was designed to compare preoperative with postoperative chemotherapy in patients with early breast cancer concerning breast conserving therapy (BCT) procedures, disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). METHODS: Patients (n = 698) with early breast cancer were enrolled between 1991 and 1999 and randomized between preoperative versus postoperative chemotherapy (four cycles of fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide). Endpoints were BCT procedures, DFS, OS, and tumor response to preoperative chemotherapy. In addition, tumor tissue was collected for translational research and the following markers were examined: ER, PgR, HER2, p21, p53, and bcl-2 expression. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 10 years, there was no statistically significant difference between the two treatment arms for OS (HR = 1.09; 95%CI 0.83-1.42; P = 0.54), DFS (HR = 1.12; 95%CI 0.90-1.39; P = 0.30), or locoregional recurrences (LRR, HR = 1.16; 95%CI 0.77-1.74). Preoperative chemotherapy was associated with an increase in BCT rates. BCT in part feasible due to tumor downsizing after preoperative chemotherapy was not correlated with higher LRR or worse OS compared to BCT which was feasible without downsizing of the tumor. Using available tumor material, only tumor stage, nodal stage, and grade were independent prognostic factors for overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative chemotherapy does not result in a difference in OS or DFS compared to postoperative chemotherapy in patients with early breast cancer. Moreover, it increases BCT rates with no significant increase of LRR. This implies that preoperative chemotherapy is a safe procedure for patients with early breast cancer, even after a follow-up period of 10 years.",1
Toxic effects of early adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.,"Combination cytotoxic chemotherapy (intravenous cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil) was administered within 36 h of mastectomy to 368 women with operable breast cancer in a randomised, controlled clinical trial. The control group of 187 patients received either no chemotherapy or conventionally timed chemotherapy. Unpredictable and severe toxic effects were significantly more common in patients aged greater than or equal to 50 who had received at least 80% of the full chemotherapy dose and in patients who had received chemotherapy within 6 h of mastectomy than in other patients. Methotrexate was believed to be the principal cause of these toxic effects, because of potentiation by nitrous oxide anaesthesia. Leucovorin rescue was therefore added to the regimen.",0
Adjuvant systemic therapy for breast cancer in the elderly: competing causes of mortality. International Breast Cancer Study Group.,"Between 1978 and 1981 we conducted a trial in which adjuvant endocrine therapy consisting of tamoxifen (T = 20 mg/d) and low-dose prednisone (p = 7.5 mg/d) for the duration of one year (p + T), was compared with no adjuvant therapy (observation) in 320 women with operable breast cancer aged 66 to 80 years (median age, 70 years). All patients had axillary lymph node metastases after at least a total mastectomy and axillary clearance. At 96 months median follow-up, 9.1% of the patients died without apparent relapse from cancer. An additional 1.9% had a second malignant neoplastic disease (not breast cancer). The 8-year disease-free survival (DFS) percentages (+/- SE) for the p + T and the observation groups were 36% (+/- 4%), and 22% (+/- 3%), (P = .004). The 8-year overall survival percentages were 49% (+/- 4%) and 42% (+/- 4%), respectively (P = .43). We conclude that despite a large proportion of deaths without relapse of breast cancer, a significant advantage for the p + T group in terms of DFS was demonstrated. We hypothesize that an endocrine therapy of longer duration might have an overall survival benefit in a population of elderly patients.",1
Prognostic factors in the initial response to therapy by patients with advanced breast cancer.,"Identification of important prognostic factors with respect to the patient's initial response to therapy was made from a set of 25 covariates available on 281 patients with advanced breast cancer. Since the patients studied were all participants in a randomized clinical trial that involved three different treatment regimens (repeated weekly treatment of a combination of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, vincristine, and prednisone; intermittent treatment of the same preceding five drugs given in 5-day courses every 4 weeks; or treatment every 3 weeks with adriamycin as a single agent), the effect of these treatments on the selection of important covariates was assessed. Although some evidence indicated that the set of important covariates differed by treatment, the differences were not strong enough to be of practical importance. Non-Caucasian patients did poorly on all regimens with a response rate of only 31% compared to 62% for Caucasian patients. The covariates of major prognostic importance for Caucasians were: disease-free interval, liver involvement, and performance status. Ambulatory patients with long disease-free intervals and no liver involvement had the best prognosis. After adjustments were made for these three covariates, the remaining covariates (such as menopausal status, bone involvement, number of metastatic sites, and duration of metastatic disease) were not significantly related to response. As reported earlier, the treatment effect was significant, even after adjustments were made for the important covariates.",0
"Weight gain in women with breast cancer treated with adjuvant cyclophosphomide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil. Analysis of resting energy expenditure and body composition.","BACKGROUND: Weight gain is a common side effect observed in women undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. Among possible causes a direct effect of chemotherapy on metabolism has been proposed. Body composition variations after adjuvant chemotherapy suggest the occurrence of sarcopenic obesity, possibly due to ovarian failure. We investigated acute and chronic effects of adjuvant chemotherapy on body weight, resting energy expenditure (REE) and plasma catecholamines in a group of menopausal women. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty menopausal women with stage I-II breast cancer were recruited for the study. We measured REE and respiratory quotient (RQ) and body composition at the beginning and after 3 and 6 months of adjuvant cyclophosphomide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF). REE, RQ, and plasma catecholamines were assessed before and after each chemotherapy session. At each session food intake was also assessed in all patients, by a food diary. Seven patients out of the group of 30 were also evaluated after a placebo infusion (saline). RESULTS: A significant weight gain was observed in all women (70.5 +/- 3 v.s. 67.7 +/- 3 kg, p < 0.001), with increase in both fat-free mass (FFM) (45.2 +/- 1.5 v.s. 43.6 +/- 1.3 kg, p < 0.001) and fat-mass (FM) (25.3 +/- 1.7 v.s. 24.1 +/- 1.8 kg, p < 0.005). A decrease in REE and RQ was observed both during CMF and placebo infusion (p < 0.05). During acute CMF and placebo infusion a reduction of plasma levels of noradrenaline was observed at the first and last session. REE increased progressively during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: CMF therapy apparently has no effect on REE either acutely or during a 6-month-period; the increased REE observed in the long-term is likely due to the concomitant increase in FFM. The lack of evidence of sarcopenic obesity, at variance with previous literature, is likely due to different patient selection.",0
"Gene expression profiles of breast cancer obtained from core cut biopsies before neoadjuvant docetaxel, adriamycin, and cyclophoshamide chemotherapy correlate with routine prognostic markers and could be used to identify predictive signatures.","BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant administration of chemotherapy provides a unique opportunity to monitor response to treatment in breast cancer and assesses response exactly. Global gene expression profiling by microarrays has been used as a valuable tool for the identification of prognostic and predictive marker genes. Even though this technology is now wide spread and relatively standardized, there are only few data available which compare established parameters with expression values to determine reliability of this method. Therefore we analyzed gene expression data of pretreatment biopsies of breast cancer patients and compared them with the results of the immunohistochemical receptor expression for ER/ PR and Her-2, as well as FISH testing for HER-2 amplification. We analyzed the change of expression of these markers before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Furthermore we evaluated the predictive significance of prognostic gene signatures as described by Sorlie, van't Veer and Ahr for response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS: Pretherapeutic core biopsies were obtained from 70 patients undergoing neoadjuvant TAC chemotherapy within the GEPARTRIO-trial. Samples were characterized according to standard pathology including ER, PR and HER2 IHC and amount of cancer cells. Only biopsies with more than 80 % tumor cells were considered for further examination. RNA was isolated and expression profiling performed using Affymetrix Hg U133 Arrays (22 500 genes). GeneData's Expressionist software was used for bioinformatic analyses. RESULTS: More than two thirds of the biopsies yielded sufficient amounts (> 5 microg) of RNA for expression profiling and high quality data were obtained for 50 samples. Unsupervised clustering broadly revealed a correlation with hormone receptor status. When ER-alpha, PR and HER2 as analyzed by immunohistochemistry were compared to the corresponding mRNA data from gene chips more than 90 % concordance was observed. We could observe a switch of receptor expression for ER, PR or HER-2 from positive to negative and vice versa in 16/35 cases (45.7 %) and 5/22 cases (22.7 %) respectively. The prognostic marker sets of Sorlie, van't Veer and Ahr could not discriminate responders from non-responders in our patient group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that reliable expression profiles can be achieved by using limited amounts of tissue obtained during neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Microarray data capture conventional prognostic markers but might contain additional informative gene sets correlated with treatment outcome. Prognostic marker sets are not suitable to predict tumor response in the neoadjuvant setting, suggesting the necessity of class prediction methods to identify marker sets predictive for the type of therapy used.",0
Timing of radiotherapy and outcome in patients receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the association between the interval from breast-conserving surgery (BCS) to radiotherapy (RT) and the clinical outcome among patients treated with adjuvant endocrine therapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patient information was obtained from three International Breast Cancer Study Group trials. The analysis was restricted to 964 patients treated with BCS and adjuvant endocrine therapy. The patients were divided into two groups according to the median number of days between BCS and RT and into four groups according to the quartile of time between BCS and RT. The endpoints were the interval to local recurrence, disease-free survival, and overall survival. Proportional hazards regression analysis was used to perform comparisons after adjustment for baseline factors.RESULTS: The median interval between BCS and RT was 77 days. RT timing was significantly associated with age, menopausal status, and estrogen receptor status. After adjustment for these factors, no significant effect of a RT delay ≤20 weeks was found. The adjusted hazard ratio for RT within 77 days vs. after 77 days was 0.94 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.47-1.87) for the interval to local recurrence, 1.05 (95% CI, 0.82-1.34) for disease-free survival, and 1.07 (95% CI, 0.77-1.49) for overall survival. For the interval to local recurrence the adjusted hazard ratio for ≤48, 49-77, and 78-112 days was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.34-2.37), 0.86 (95% CI, 0.33-2.25), and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.33-2.41), respectively, relative to ≥113 days.CONCLUSION: A RT delay of ≤20 weeks was significantly associated with baseline factors such as age, menopausal status, and estrogen-receptor status. After adjustment for these factors, the timing of RT was not significantly associated with the interval to local recurrence, disease-free survival, or overall survival.",0
Randomized trial comparing neo-adjuvant versus adjuvant chemotherapy in operable locally advanced breast cancer (T4b N0-2 M0).,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) remains a major problem in developing countries. While trials utilizing neo-adjuvant chemotherapy demonstrate superior survival rates compared to historic controls, randomized studies evaluating the precise role of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in LABC are lacking. In the present trial, neo-adjuvant chemotherapy was compared against adjuvant chemotherapy to assess survival advantage in operable T4b N0-2 M0 breast cancer. METHODS: A total of 101 women with operable LABC (T4b N0-2 M0) were randomized. In arm A, 50 patients received 3 cycles of CEF chemotherapy before and 3 cycles following surgery. In arm B, 51 patients had primary surgery followed by 6 cycles of CEF chemotherapy. In both arms, loco-regional radiotherapy was given after completion of CEF. RESULTS: The response of primary tumor to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy was 66%, complete response (CR) 14% and partial response (PR) 52%. Clinical nodal response occurred in 95% of node positive patients. Only two (4%) patients had pathologic CR both in tumor and axilla. There was a significant (P = 0.02) increase in incidence of pathologically negative nodes in arm A. At a median follow up of 25 months, there was no significant difference in overall and disease free survival (DFS) in both arms (P = 0.42 and 0.18). Patients showing a response to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy had better DFS (P = 0.04) compared to those who had no response. CONCLUSIONS: Early results of the study indicate no survival benefit with the inclusion of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in LABC (T4b N0-2 M0). Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy resulted in significant down staging; good responders had a better DFS compared to those who did not respond.",1
Trait anxiety and tamoxifen effects on bone mineral density and sex hormone- binding globulin.,"OBJECTIVE: Tamoxifen therapy preserves BMD of the lumbar spine and increases levels of SHBG. We assessed whether trait anxiety, a factor linked with a reactive endocrine system, is associated with differential changes in BMD and SHBG levels in response to tamoxifen therapy. METHODS: Postmenopausal women (N= 140) with axillary-node-negative breast cancer participated in a 2-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of tamoxifen (10 mg twice a day). Levels of BMD and SHBG were assessed at baseline and at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. RESULTS: Trait anxiety predicted tamoxifen-induced changes in lumbar spine BMD; high levels of trait anxiety were associated with significantly greater lumbar spine BMD at 3, 12, and 24 months (p values <.05) for women on tamoxifen therapy. High anxiety also was associated with lower levels of SHBG for women using tamoxifen at 3, 12, 18, and 24 months (p values <.05). CONCLUSIONS: Trait anxiety is associated with greater preservation of lumbar spine BMD in response to tamoxifen and with a suppression of tamoxifen-induced increases in SHBG. Trait anxiety and other affective traits may serve as indicators of underlying physiological processes that moderate the effects of estrogen receptor modulators (such as tamoxifen) in clinical trials. Such data may help to elucidate the physiological mechanisms responsible for some of the variation in individual responses to treatment.",0
Randomized trial of 3 different regimens of combination chemotherapy in patients receiving simultaneously a hormonal treatment for advanced breast cancer.,"We report the results of a randomized trial carried out by the Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (SAKK) and in which 230 patients with advanced breast cancer receiving concurrently a hormonal treatment (oophorectomy for pre- and tamoxifen for postmenopausal women) were randomly allocated to three different regimens of combination chemotherapy. The therapeutic results registered with the two more intensive combinations (LMP/FVP and LMFP/ADM) were similar with regard to response rates, time to progression and survival. The patients receiving the low-dose chemotherapy lmfp showed a statistically significant lower response rate (32%, P less than 0.001) and a shorter survival (P = 0.03) than the results observed in patients treated with the two other regimens. This difference was particularly pronounced, at least regarding survival, in the following subgroups: postmenopausal women, patients with a poor performance status, dominant visceral lesions, two sites of disease and a disease-free interval longer than 12 months. Patients with bony metastases as dominant lesion fared similarly with all three regimens of chemotherapy. This latter subset of advanced breast cancer patients should probably be spared too intensive cytotoxic treatment. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of a randomized trial showing an evident correlation between response rate and survival in various subgroups of patients with advanced breast cancer treated with different chemotherapeutic regimens.",1
Relaxation and guided imagery program in patients with breast cancer undergoing radiotherapy is not associated with neuroimmunomodulatory effects.,"OBJECTIVE: Treatment of breast cancer is usually associated with significant psychological stress. In this study, we examined the effects of relaxation and visualization therapy (RVT) on psychological distress, cortisol levels, and immunological parameters of breast cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to either the experimental (n=20) who underwent group RVT for 24 consecutive days or control group (n=14) who were on radiotherapy only. Psychological scores (stress, anxiety, and depression) were measured by structured clinical interviews. Salivary cortisol was assessed along the day. Lymphocytes were isolated and cultured to measure T-cell proliferation and sensitivity to glucocorticoids (GCs). RESULTS: RVT was effective to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression scores (all P<.05). However, cortisol levels as well as proliferation remained unchanged following RVT. Although T cells of experimental group were more sensitive to GCs than cells of controls at baseline, no changes were noted following RVT. Cortisol levels were positively correlated to anxiety and depression scores and inversely correlated to T-cell proliferation and sensitivity to GCs. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the psychological intervention was capable to attenuate the emotional distress presented during radiotherapy treatment. A longer RVT or worse psychological morbidity at baseline may be necessary to translate psychological into biological changes.",0
Adjuvant trial of 12 cycles of CMFPT followed by observation or continuous tamoxifen versus four cycles of CMFPT in postmenopausal women with breast cancer: an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group phase III study.,"A prospectively controlled randomized trial to compare the adjuvant efficacy of 12 cycles of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil, prednisone, and tamoxifen (CMFPT) followed by observation or a total of 5 years of continuous tamoxifen versus four cycles of CMFPT followed by observation in postmenopausal women with operable node-positive breast cancer was started by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) in 1982. In 1986 the study was modified to allow patients on CMFPT X 12 plus continuous tamoxifen to be rerandomized after completing 5 years of tamoxifen to either continue for life or to stop therapy. Patients were stratified for number of involved nodes and estrogen-receptor (ER) status and randomized to receive one of three treatments: CMFPT X 4, CMFPT X 12, or CMFPT X 12 plus continuous tamoxifen. Of 962 patients entered on the study, 803 were eligible. Life-threatening toxicity occurred in 75 and lethal toxicity in seven patients. Median follow-up is 4.1 years; 279 patients had recurrent disease. Time to relapse (TTR) is significantly longer for patients on CMFPT X 12 plus continuous tamoxifen than for CMFPT X 4 (P = .002), or CMFPT X 12 (P = 0.05). Differences between four or 12 cycles of CMFPT are not significant; relapse-free rates at 5 years are 61% for CMFPT X 12 plus continuous tamoxifen, 51% on CMFPT X 12, and 52% on CMFPT X 4. Treatment differences in overall survival are not significant. Hormone receptor status and number of involved nodes were found to be significant prognostic parameters.",1
A randomized phase II trial comparing preoperative plus perioperative chemotherapy with preoperative chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced breast cancer.,"The aim of this study was to investigate in a randomized trial the activity of perioperative chemotherapy in patients treated with preoperative chemotherapy for locally advanced breast cancer and to compare it with the preoperative chemotherapy alone. Patients with cT2-3 N0-2 M0 histologically proven breast cancer, with estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors in less than 20% of cells, or with absence of progesterone receptors, received epirubicin 25 mg/m days 1 and 2, cisplatin 60 mg/m day 1, and fluorouracil 200 mg/m daily as continuous infusion. Responding patients were randomized to continue fluorouracil until 2 weeks after surgery (perioperative chemotherapy) or to stop fluorouracil 1 week before surgery. Fifty-eight patients completed six courses of epirubicin, cisplatin and fluorouracil, and were randomized to perioperative chemotherapy (29 patients) or to control (29 patients). The median Ki-67 index remained stable (32-27.5%) in the perioperative chemotherapy arm (P=0.3) and decreased from 55 to 22.5% in the control arm (P=0.01). The rate of pathological complete remission was 41% in both arms (P=1.0). No significant difference in terms of disease-free survival and overall survival was observed between the two arms. Perioperative chemotherapy failed to show an increase in the pathological complete remission rate. A biological effect on Ki-67 expression was demonstrated.",0
Comparison of two-year and five-year tamoxifen use in Japanese post-menopausal women.,"AIM: Large multicenter, randomized trials have revealed the advantages of using tamoxifen for 5 years vs 2 years in breast cancer patients. The aim of this report is to confirm the optimal duration of tamoxifen administration in a study of Japanese breast cancer patients. METHODS: Japanese post-menopausal estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients treated with mastectomy were randomly assigned to either a 5-year or 2-year course of tamoxifen. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival, with secondary endpoints of overall survival and a reduction in the development of metachronous contra-lateral breast cancer. RESULTS: A total of 256 breast cancer patients were randomized to a 5-year or 2-year tamoxifen administration group. After a median follow-up time of 81 months, there were no significant differences seen in terms of disease-free or overall survival (p=0.65 and 0.56, respectively). Furthermore, the impact of the 5-year use of tamoxifen on the development of contra-lateral breast cancer did not reach statistical significance (p=0.0511). However, 5-year tamoxifen use was closely associated with gynaecological complications (p=0.0081). CONCLUSION: We could not show a beneficial effect of using tamoxifen for 5 years over 2 years in Japanese estrogen receptor-positive patients. This is likely due to the small number of patients enrolled in our study; however, racial disparity may influence this result. A reevaluation is necessary to study the advantages of the 5-year use of tamoxifen in the Japanese racial subgroup.",1
"A randomised feasibility/phase II study (SBG 2004-1) with dose-dense/tailored epirubicin, cyclophoshamide (EC) followed by docetaxel (T) or fixed dosed dose-dense EC/T versus T, doxorubicin and C (TAC) in node-positive breast cancer.","The aim of the study was to evaluate the feasibility of tailored and dose-dense epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel as adjuvant breast cancer therapy. Material and methods. Patients with node-positive breast cancer received either four cycles of biweekly and tailored EC (epirubicin 38-60-75-90-105-120 mg/m(2), cyclophosphamide 450-600-900-1200 mg/m(2)) followed by four cycles of docetaxel (60-75-85-100 mg/m(2)) (arm A) or the same regimen with fixed doses (E(90)C(600) + 4 → T(75) + 4) (arm B) or docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (T(75)A(50)C(500)) every three weeks for six cycles (arm C). All patients received G-CSF support and prophylactic ciprofloxacin. Results. One-hundred and twenty-four patients were randomised in the study. In the A, B and C arm, 17% 19% and 3% of the patients had one or more cycles delayed due to side-effects whereas 24%, 5% and 15% experienced a grade 3 infection or febrile neutropenia. After the introduction of an extra week between the EC and T parts in the A and B arms, grade 3 hand-foot-skin reactions were reduced from 5 to 0.2%. Twenty-nine percent (A and B) and 20% (C) of the patients were hospitalised due to side-effects. Discussion. Dose-dense and tailored EC/T can be given with manageable toxicity and is after adjustment presently studied in the phase III Panther trial.",1
Amelioration of vincristine neurotoxicity by glutamic acid.,"Neurotoxicity is the principal limiting side effect of the widely used antitumor agent, vincristine. Following evaluation of glutamic acid as a potential modifier of vincristine toxicity in preclinical studies in mice and a preliminary clinical trial, a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial was conducted by the Piedmont Oncology Association. Of 87 patients entered into the study, 84 were evaluable, including 42 patients who were randomly assigned to receive vincristine 1.0 mg/m2 weekly for six doses and 42 patients who were assigned to receive glutamic acid 500 mg orally three times daily plus vincristine. The following neurotoxic signs and symptoms were evaluated before each dose of vincristine: reflex changes, paresthesias, constipation, strength, and mental changes. Loss of the Achilles tendon reflex, an objective parameter, was noted in 19 percent of patients receiving glutamic acid and 42 percent of control subjects (p = 0.03). Development of moderate to severe paresthesias, a subjective parameter, occurred in 19 percent of the glutamic acid group and 36 percent of the placebo group (p = 0.09). Overall moderate neurotoxicity (6 units or more), determined by adding the grade of each neurotoxic parameter for the weekly clinic visit in which maximum neurotoxicity occurred, was observed in 21 percent of patients receiving glutamic acid and 43 percent of those in the control group (p = 0.04). Hematologic and gastrointestinal side effects occurred with similar frequency in the two groups. The administration of glutamic acid has decreased vincristine-induced neurotoxicity without any attendant side effects.",0
Adverse effect on bone marrow protection of prechemotherapy granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support.,"BACKGROUND: Increased proliferation of endogenous bone marrow progenitor cells in response to the administration of hematopoietic growth factors, followed by reduced cell cycling or entrance of the cells into a quiescent state upon withdrawal of the growth factors, may have clinically relevant effects on the tolerance of the hematopoietic system to subsequent myelotoxic treatments.PURPOSE: We investigated the ability of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to protect progenitor cells in the bone marrow of cancer patients from the toxic effects of subsequent treatments with chemotherapeutic agents.METHODS: Thirty-six patients with histologically documented, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive doxorubicin once every 3 weeks at a dose of 75 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide at a dose of 1000 mg/m2, with G-CSF administered either before and after chemotherapy (18 patients) or after chemotherapy only (18 patients). For prechemotherapy administration of G-CSF, recombinant human methionyl (r-met Hu) G-CSF was administered subcutaneously to patients twice per day for 5 days at a dose of 5 micrograms/kg, with the last dose given 48 hours before the start of chemotherapy. For postchemotherapy administration of G-CSF, r-met Hu G-CSF was administered subcutaneously to patients once per day for 7 days at a dose of 5 micrograms/kg, with the first dose given 24 hours after chemotherapy.RESULTS: The incidence or the duration of grade 4 neutropenia was not reduced in all patients by the use of prechemotherapy G-CSF; the incidence over all cycles of chemotherapy was 74% for patients treated with prechemotherapy and postchemotherapy G-CSF and 66% for patients treated with postchemotherapy G-CSF only (two-sided P, adjusted for dose = .21) and the median duration in both treatment arms was 3 days (two-sided P = .19). Unexpectedly, the incidence of grades 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia was much greater in patients who received prechemotherapy G-CSF compared with those who did not (54% versus 6%, respectively, over all chemotherapy cycles; two-sided P, adjusted for dose < .001). No difference in the decrease in hemoglobin level (adjusted for red blood cell transfusions) between patients in the two treatment arms was observed.CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: No beneficial effects were associated with the administration of G-CSF to cancer patients prior to chemotherapy. The observation of more severe thrombocytopenia in patients treated with prechemotherapy G-CSF led us to conclude that the proliferation of progenitor cells was still increased 48 hours after the last dose of G-CSF and that the administration of chemotherapy at or within this time period actually worsens the toxic effects on bone marrow. This result has important ramifications for the design of clinical cancer treatment protocols, especially those that involve shortened intervals between cycles of chemotherapeutic agent administration.",0
Impairment of cognitive function in women receiving adjuvant treatment for high-risk breast cancer: high-dose versus standard-dose chemotherapy.,"BACKGROUND: Although high-dose chemotherapy is rapidly gaining acceptance as a treatment option for a number of cancers, the long-term toxic effects of such therapy are a concern. Cognitive deficits (e.g., problems with memory and concentration) are not uncommon after chemotherapy, but they have not been documented systematically. In this study, we assessed the prevalence of cognitive deficits in a group of patients with high-risk breast cancer who were randomly assigned to receive either high-dose or standard-dose adjuvant chemotherapy plus tamoxifen, and we investigated whether high-dose chemotherapy impaired cognitive functioning more than standard-dose chemotherapy. METHODS: Cognitive functioning was evaluated by use of a battery of neuropsychologic tests. In addition, patients were interviewed with regard to cognitive problems, health-related quality of life, anxiety, and depression. Results from patients who received adjuvant systemic therapy were compared with results from patients who had early stage breast cancer not treated with such therapy (control patients). RESULTS: The study population consisted of 34 patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy plus tamoxifen, 36 patients treated with standard-dose chemotherapy plus tamoxifen, and 34 control patients. For all patients, the average time since the completion of last nonhormonal therapy was 2 years. Cognitive impairment was found in 32% of the patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy, in 17% of the patients treated with standard-dose chemotherapy, and in 9% of the control patients. In comparison with the control patients, patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy appeared to have an 8.2-times higher risk of cognitive impairment (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.8-37.7); in comparison with the patients who received standard-dose chemotherapy, this risk of impairment was 3.5-times higher (95% CI = 1.0-12.8). CONCLUSION: High-dose chemotherapy appears to impair cognitive functioning more than standard-dose chemotherapy. Central nervous system toxicity may be a dose-limiting factor in high-dose chemotherapy regimens.",0
Efficacy of pamidronate in reducing skeletal complications in patients with breast cancer and lytic bone metastases. Protocol 19 Aredia Breast Cancer Study Group.,"BACKGROUND: Bisphosphonates such as pamidronate disodium inhibit osteoclast-induced bone resorption associated with cancer that has metastasized to bone. METHODS: Women with stage IV breast cancer who were receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy and had at least one lytic bone lesion were given either placebo or pamidronate (90 mg) as a two-hour intravenous infusion monthly for 12 cycles. Skeletal complications, including pathologic fractures, the need for radiation to bone or bone surgery, spinal cord compression, and hypercalcemia (a serum calcium concentration above 12 mg per deciliter [3.0 mmol per liter] or elevated to any degree and requiring treatment), were assessed monthly. Bone pain, use of analgesic drugs, performance status, and quality of life were assessed throughout the trial. RESULTS: The efficacy of treatment was evaluated in 380 of 382 randomized patients, 185 receiving pamidronate and 195 receiving placebo. The median time to the occurrence of the first skeletal complication was greater in the pamidronate group than in the placebo group (13.1 vs. 7.0 months, P=0.005), and the proportion of patients in whom any skeletal complication occurred was lower (43 percent vs. 56 percent, P = 0.008). There was significantly less increase in bone pain (P=0.046) and deterioration of performance status (P=0.027) in the pamidronate group than in the placebo group. Pamidronate was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Monthly infusions of pamidronate as a supplement to chemotherapy can protect against skeletal complications in women with stage IV breast cancer who have osteolytic bone metastases.",0
"The associations between severity of early postoperative pain, chronic postsurgical pain and plasma concentration of stable nitric oxide products after breast surgery.","In this study, we compared the effects of two analgesic regimens on perioperative nitric oxide index (NOx) and the likelihood of subsequent development of chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) after breast surgery and sought to determine the association among early postoperative pain, NOx, and the likelihood of subsequent development of CPSP. Twenty-nine consecutive ASA I or II patients undergoing breast surgery with axillary clearance were randomly allocated to one of two groups. Patients in group S (n = 15) received a standard intraoperative and postoperative analgesic regimen (morphine sulfate, diclofenac, dextropropoxyphene hydrochloride + acetaminophen prn). Patients in group N (n = 14) received a continuous paravertebral block (for 48 h) and acetaminophen and parecoxib (followed by celecoxib up to 5 days). Visual analog scale pain scores at rest and on arm movement were recorded regularly until the fifth postoperative day. A telephone interview was conducted 10 wk postoperatively. The McGill Pain Questionnaire was used to characterize pain. NOx was estimated preoperatively, at the end of surgery, 30 min and 2, 4, 12, 24, 48 h postoperatively. Twelve (80%) patients in group S and no patient in group N developed CPSP (P = 0.009). Compared with patients with a pain rating index > or =1 (n = 18) 10 wk postoperatively, patients with a pain rating index = 0 (n = 11) had lesser visual analog scale pain scores on movement at each postoperative time point from 30 min until 96 h postoperatively (P < 0.005) and at rest 30 min (0.6 +/- 1.5 versus 30.2 +/- 26.8; P = 0.004), 4 h (2.3 +/- 7.5 versus 19.0 +/- 25.8; P = 0.013), 8 h (4.4 +/- 10.2 versus 21.4 +/- 27.0; P = 0.03) and 12 h (0.7 +/- 1.2 versus 15.4 +/- 27.0; P = 0.035) postoperatively. NOx values were greater in group N compared with group S 48 h postoperatively (40.6 +/- 20.1 versus 26.4 +/- 13.5; P = 0.04).",0
Neurophysiological evaluation of late effects of adjuvant high-dose chemotherapy on cognitive function.,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate late neurotoxicity of adjuvant high-dose (HD) chemotherapy versus standard-dose (SD) chemotherapy by event-related potentials (ERP) and quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG). PATIENTS AND METHODS: From a randomized study in high-risk breast cancer patients on the efficacy of high-dose versus standard-dose adjuvant chemotherapy, late effects on cognitive functioning were analyzed by neuropsychological tests. Cognitive impairment was found in 32% of the HD group, 17% of the SD group and in 9% of a control group of stage I breast cancer patients not treated with chemotherapy. In 17 consecutive patients in the HD group and 16 consecutive patients in the SD group neurophysiological tests were performed, consisting of P300 and qEEG. Results of patients treated with chemotherapy were compared with results of 14 control patients not treated with chemotherapy. All patients were tested two years after treatment. RESULTS: Asymmetry of the alpha rhythm of > or =0.5 Hz was found in 7 HD patients, 2 SD patients and in none of the control patients (p = 0.01). No differences were found between the groups with regard to frequency of alpha rhythm, alpha blocking and latency of P300. No correlation was found between neurophysiological parameters and neuropsychological performance, except for an overall relation between the P300 latencies and the total number of deviant test scores. CONCLUSION: Although the neurophysiological differences are subtle and the relation with the cognitive functioning in individual patients as measured by the neuropsychological examination is equivocal, the results suggest that there is neurophysiological support for cognitive dysfunction as a late complication of high-dose systemic chemotherapy in breast cancer.",0
Pathological response to preoperative concurrent chemo-radiotherapy for breast cancer: results of a phase II study.,"This study evaluated, in terms of pathological complete response (pCR) and acute toxicity, preoperative concurrent (5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-vinorelbine) chemoradiotherapy for large breast cancers. A total of 60 women were included in the study. Chemotherapy consisted of 4 cycles of 5-FU, 500 mg/m2/d, continuous infusion (d1-d5) and vinorelbine, 25 mg/m2 (d1; d6). Starting with the second cycle, radiotherapy delivered 50 Gy to the breast and 46 Gy to the internal mammary and supra/infra-clavicular lymph nodes. Breast surgery and axillary lymph node dissection were then performed. Four patients did not complete their chemotherapy. Breast conservation was possible in 69% of patients. The rate of pCR was 27%. Three factors were associated with pCR: histological grade 3, absence of hormonal receptors and high mitotic index. Grade 4 haematological toxicity occurred in 22% of patients. In conclusion, chemoradiotherapy demonstrated good efficacy, both in terms of pCR and in allowing breast conservation with acceptable tolerance.",0
Early stopping of a clinical trial when there is evidence of no treatment benefit: protocol B-14 of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project.,"Although several randomized clinical trials in the 1980s indicated a benefit from the use of tamoxifen in the treatment of early-stage breast cancer, questions have remained regarding the optimal duration of drug administration. In 1982, the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) initiated a randomized trial to compare 5 years of tamoxifen to placebo among breast cancer patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors and no evidence of axillary node involvement. By 1987, evidence of a substantial benefit for tamoxifen led the NSABP to extend this trial to determine whether longer duration tamoxifen therapy would be additionally beneficial. This study randomized patients who had completed 5 years of tamoxifen free of breast cancer recurrence or other events to either tamoxifen or placebo for an additional 5 years. By 1994, 1172 women had entered the study and accrual was closed. In late 1995, the trial was terminated on the basis of interim findings indicating that a benefit for continuing tamoxifen would not be realized. The closure has prompted controversy among cancer researchers, because there are currently at least three tamoxifen duration trials in progress, whereas results from two other studies evaluating 5-year duration therapy versus longer therapy were recently published. Here, we provide details of the statistical rationale contributing to our decision to recommend early closure of the study. We then consider other possible approaches to assessing the appropriateness of early termination in the face of evidence against a benefit, including Bayesian methods, which can be used to incorporate a range of prior beliefs regarding the efficacy of a treatment with accruing information from the trial. We also briefly discuss results of the other published studies.",0
Evaluation of VP-16 and the combination of adriamycin and vincristine in advanced breast cancer.,"39 previously treated patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated in a partially randomized study evaluating VP-16 and the combination of Vincristine (VCR) and Adriamycin (ADR). Of the 19 patients treated with VP-16 initially, two had partial remissions. No responses were noted in eleven patients who corssed-over after failing VCR plus ADR. Of the 20 patients treated with VCR plus ADR initially, four patients had partial responses. An additional 2/15 patients responded on crossover after failing initially on VP-16. No significant differences in time to last follow-up or death could be detected between the two treatment programs.",0
Evaluation of soy phytoestrogens for the treatment of hot flashes in breast cancer survivors: A North Central Cancer Treatment Group Trial.,"PURPOSE: Hot flashes represent a significant clinical problem for some breast cancer survivors. Safe, effective treatment is needed for this prominent clinical problem. Although it has been shown that estrogen or progesterone replacement therapy can alleviate this problem, there are continued safety concerns regarding the use of hormonal therapies in these women. Based on anecdotal information, we hypothesized that soy-derived phytoestrogens, weak estrogen-like substances in the soybean that demonstrate estrogen agonist and/or antagonist effects when they bind to estrogen receptors, could alleviate hot flashes. This current trial was designed to investigate this hypothesis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This double-blind clinical trial involved breast cancer survivors with substantial hot flashes. After randomization, patients underwent a 1-week baseline period with no therapy. This was followed by 4 weeks of either soy tablets or placebo. The patients then crossed over to the opposite arm in a double-blind manner for the last 4 weeks. Patients completed a daily questionnaire documenting hot flash frequency, intensity, and perceived side effects. RESULTS: Of the 177 women who were randomized and started the study substance, 155 (88%) provided useable data over the first 5 weeks; 149 provided usable data over the entire 9 weeks. There was no suggestion that the soy product was more effective in reducing hot flashes than the placebo. At study completion, patients preferred the soy product 33% of the time, the placebo 37% of the time, and neither substance 31% of the time. No toxicity was observed. CONCLUSION: The soy product did not alleviate hot flashes in breast cancer survivors.",0
"Epirubicin-based chemotherapy as adjuvant treatment for poor prognosis, node-negative breast cancer: 10-year follow-up results of the French Adjuvant Study Group 03 trial.","We evaluated the contribution of an epirubicin-based adjuvant chemotherapy on disease-free survival (DFS) in poor prognosis, node-negative breast cancer (BC) patients. Poor prognostic factors were defined as: pathologic tumor size >or= 4 cm, estrogen-receptor negative, and progesterone-receptor negative. Scarff-Bloom Richardson grade 2 tumors must have two of these factors, and only one in case of grade 3. Between 1988 and 1994, 328 patients were randomized to receive either no systemic treatment (control, n = 161), or fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 50 mg/m(2), cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2), 6 cycles every 21 days (FEC50, n = 167), without any hormonal treatment. The median follow up was 114 months. The 10-year DFS rates were 64 and 71%, respectively (p = 0.23). In the Cox regression model, independent prognostic factors of relapse were the number of nodes examined < 10 (p = 0.002), BCS (p = 0.01), and premenopausal status (p = 0.04). In this model, the relative risk of relapse was 1.46 (CI95 %: 1.05-1.87) in favor of FEC50. In patients who underwent BCS, 21 % developed a local relapse (24 versus 18 %, respectively). The 10-year local DFS was 70.5 and 79.3 %, respectively (p = 0.27). The 10-year overall survival was not different (74.1 versus 70.7 %, p = 0.82). After 10 years of follow-up, the FEC50 regimen reduced the risk of relapse in poor-prognosis node-negative BC patients. The incidence of local relapse was high, and probably related to inclusion criteria. Epirubicin was probably underdosed in such patients, and ongoing studies using 100 mg/m(2) of epirubicin will give us the answer in a near future.",0
Anastrozole (Arimidex) versus tamoxifen as first-line therapy for advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women: survival analysis and updated safety results.,"We present an initial survival analysis and an update of the safety data of the North American and Tamoxifen or Arimidex Randomized Group Efficacy and Tolerability (TARGET) double-blind, randomised, multicentre studies which compared anastrozole with tamoxifen as first-line treatment in postmenopausal patients with oestrogen receptor and/or progesterone receptor-positive (ER+/PR+) or receptor-unknown advanced breast cancer (ABC). At a median follow-up of 43.7 months, 56.0% of patients in the anastrozole group and 56.1% of patients in the tamoxifen group had died. The proportion of patients dead at 2 years was 31.1 and 32.0% in the anastrozole and tamoxifen groups, respectively. In the ER+/PR+ subgroup, 55.1 and 55.9% of patients had died and median time to deaths (TTD) were 40.8 and 41.3 months in the anastrozole and tamoxifen groups, respectively. Both agents remained well tolerated, with fewer reports of vaginal bleeding (anastrozole versus tamoxifen, 1.0% versus 2.5%) and thromboembolic events (anastrozole versus tamoxifen, 5.3% versus 9.0%) in the anastrozole group versus the tamoxifen group. Hot flushes and vaginal dryness were reported marginally less in the tamoxifen group compared with the Anastrozole group. Although no improvement in survival was observed, the favourable profile of anastrozole with respect to efficacy (TTP) and tolerability [Cancer 92 (2001) 2247] support the use of anastrozole in advance of tamoxifen as the first-line therapy choice in postmenopausal women with ABC.",1
Thymidine kinase 1 in serum predicts increased risk of distant or loco-regional recurrence following surgery in patients with early breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of the concentration of serum thymidine kinase 1 (S-TK1) with regard to recurrence in low risk breast cancer patients, 3 months after surgery was evaluated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The concentration of S-TK1 in serum was determined in 120 breast cancer patients at the time of surgery and in 67 patients 3 months after surgery, by anti-TK1 chicken IgY antibody, using a dot-blot immuno-assay. The S-TK1 concentration was compared with the serological activity of thymidine kinase (STK) and of carbohydrate antigen (CA 15-3). RESULTS: A statistically significant trend (unadjusted) was found for recurrence (distant or loco-regional) in patients with a higher S-TK1 concentration, as compared with patients with a lower S-TK1 concentration. A multivariate analysis gave the same results. The hazard rate ratio for developing distant and/or loco-regional recurrence in patients with a higher S-TK1 concentration was about six to seven times higher than in patients with a lower S-TK1 concentration. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the S-TK1 concentration is higher in patients developing distant and/or loco-regional recurrence 3 months post-surgery.",0
"Dosage of adjuvant G-CSF (filgrastim)-supported FEC polychemotherapy based on equivalent haematological toxicity in high-risk breast cancer patients. Scandinavian Breast Group, Study SBG 9401.","BACKGROUND: Conventional dosages of cytostatics in mg/m2 will cause marked variations in systemic exposure, resulting in over- and under-treatment, at least with respect to side effects. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We are conducting a randomized adjuvant study for breast cancer patients younger than 60 years of age with > or = 70% risk of recurrence within five years. The first 89 consecutive patients who have received nine courses q three weeks of individually dose-escalated and G-CSF (filgrastim)-supported FEC (5-fluorouracil (5-FU), epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide) therapy given with ciprofloxacin prophylaxis were included in this analysis. Six different FEC dose levels were used for treatment at equivalent haematological toxicity. Dose modifications were based on white blood cell and platelet counts on days 8, 11/12, 15, and 22. RESULTS: Eighty-three of 89 patients completed all nine courses. The median epirubicin and cyclophosphamide doses were 782 mg/m2 (range 0-994 mg/m2) and 10.330 mg/m2 (range 0-14.460 mg/m2), respectively. Patients treated at the two highest dose levels experienced NCl grade 0 or 1 toxicities in 73% to 92% of the courses. Three patients have developed acute myeloid leukaemia, and two of them have demonstrated abnormalities compatible with topoisomerase II-poison-related karyotypic changes. CONCLUSIONS: Tailored adjuvant G-CSF-supported FEC polychemotherapy will make it possible for all patients to be treated at equivalent levels of haematological toxicity with significantly higher doses without a marked increase in other organ toxicities.",0
Identification and interpretation of clinical and quality of life prognostic factors for survival and response to treatment in first-line chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer.,"The aim of the project was to identify clinical and quality of life (QL) factors that together predict survival and response to chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer. Potential prognostic factors were studied in 187 women with baseline QL data from a trial of paclitaxel versus doxorubicin as first-line chemotherapy. Demographic and clinical factors studied were age, performance status, dominant site of disease and preceding disease-free interval (DFI). Factors from the EORTC QLQ-C30 were all function scales, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, pain, dyspnoea, insomnia, loss of appetite and global QL. The proportional hazards regression model with stratification for treatment, and the logistic regression model adjusting for treatment arm were used for univariate and multivariate analyses of survival and response to treatment, respectively. For survival, multiple sites of visceral disease, pain, global QL and fatigue were significant prognostic factors in the univariate analysis. The final multivariate model predicted poor survival with multiple sites of visceral disease (P=0.003), DFI </=2 years (P=0.026) and pain (P=0.003). For response, age, dyspnoea, fatigue and global QL were significant predictive factors in the univariate analysis. The final multivariate model for response selected DFI (P=0.009), multiple sites of visceral disease (P=0.037) and dyspnoea (P=<0.001) using forward selection, but model instability was indicated by the inclusion of fatigue and emotional function in the final model when backward selection was used. In addition to known clinical factors, patient-assessed QL variables appear to be prognostic for survival and response to chemotherapy in women with advanced breast cancer. However, identification of prognostic factors from responses to questionnaires may be unstable, and their reliability and clinical utility should be tested prospectively.",0
Randomized multicentric study of perioperative chemotherapy with mitoxantrone in early breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: To confirm the hypothesis that reducing the interval between surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy could improve prognosis, a randomized multicentric study of adjuvant perioperative chemotherapy (POC) in breast cancer was initiated. METHODS: A total of 552 patients were randomized to evaluate whether the addition of POC to standard adjuvant treatment significantly improved outcome. Patients were stratified according to menopausal status, with 362 patients in the postmenopausal group and 192 patients in the premenopausal group. Premenopausal women with positive axillary nodes, negative hormonal receptors, or grade 3 tumors received adjuvant mitoxantrone-based chemotherapy. Node-negative premenopausal patients with grade 1 or 2 tumors expressing hormonal receptors received no standard adjuvant treatment. All postmenopausal women received hormonal therapy (tamoxifen 20 mg/day for 3 years). The perioperative regimen was a 14 mg/m(2) mitoxantrone infusion at the end of tumor excision. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 6.1 years, this study showed no significant advantage of POC on overall survival, disease-free survival, or metastasis-free survival for the total cohort or for the premenopausal and postmenopausal groups. CONCLUSIONS: POC was a safe procedure in this study. However, the addition of POC to standard adjuvant treatment offered no benefit in breast cancer adjuvant treatment.",1
"Cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and fluorouracil (CMF) versus hormonal ablation with leuprorelin acetate as adjuvant treatment of node-positive, premenopausal breast cancer patients: preliminary results of the TABLE-study (Takeda Adjuvant Breast cancer study with Leuprorelin Acetate).","PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of leuprorelin acetate in adjuvant treatment in comparison to standard chemotherapy with CMF in premenopausal, estrogen-receptor-positive or unknown, node-positive patients with early breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The patients were randomly assigned to receive either 2 years of hormone ablation with leuprorelin acetate 11.25 mg as a subcutaneous injection every three months or six courses of CMF (cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2, methotrexate 40 mg/m2, fluorouracil 600 mg/m2, days 1 and 8, q 4 weeks). The primary study end-point was recurrence-free survival (RFS) after 2 years. Secondary end-points included overall survival, adverse events and hormonal suppression. RESULTS: Between 1995 and 1999, a total of 589 patients with breast cancer were randomized to treatment with leuprorelin acetate or CMF. The data of 227 patients were available for this first interim analysis. One hundred and ten and 117 patients were assigned to leuprorelin acetate and chemotherapy, respectively. Both treatment arms were well balanced for baseline characteristics. So far, no difference between the groups has emerged with respect to recurrence-free or overall survivaL Suppression of serum estradiol levels and menstruation was less marked in the CMF-group compared to the leuprorelin arm. The most common adverse events were low-grade hot flushes, weight gain and increased sweating in the leuprorelin-treated patients and alopecia, nausea and vomiting in the CMF-group. CONCLUSION: According to these preliminary results, ovarian suppression with leuprorelin acetate was as effective as standard chemotherapy for premenopausal women with hormone-sensitive, node-positive early breast cancer.",1
Analysis of chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea rates by three different anthracycline and taxane containing regimens for early breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: Chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea (CIA) by newer taxane-containing regimens was evaluated in early breast cancer (EBC) patients. METHODS: A prospective cohort of 122 premenopausal EBC patients participated in a phase III trial of preoperative docetaxel/capecitabine (TX) versus doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC); 34 patients received adjuvant AC followed by paclitaxel (T) and 129 patients received 5-fluorouracil/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (FAC). RESULTS: The CIA rate was 90.2% with TX/AC, 73.5% with AC followed by T, and 72.1% with FAC at 1 year (P = 0.002), and 66.7%, 73.3%, and 58.9%, respectively, at 3 years (P = 0.268). At one year, age (P < 0.001) and taxane use (P = 0.002), and after two years, age and tamoxifen use were significant factors for CIA in multivariate analysis. Serum estradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone levels were significantly correlated with menstrual status, age, and tamoxifen use. CONCLUSION: Taxanes resulted in higher CIA rates in the first year, but age and tamoxifen use were significant factors for persistent CIA.",0
The Christie hospital adjuvant tamoxifen trial--status at 10 years.,"From November 1976 to June 1982, a randomised clinical trial was carried out at the Christie Hospital, Manchester, to test the clinical efficacy of tamoxifen (TAM) as an adjuvant to surgery for patients with operable breast carcinoma. Following surgery, premenopausal women were randomly allocated to have either TAM 20 mg day-1 for one year or an irradiation menopause (the previous standard treatment). Postmenopausal women had TAM 20 mg day-1 for one year or no further treatment (Controls). A total of 1005 patients were entered into the trial of whom 961 are evaluable at 10 years from the inception. At 10 years the analysis shows no significant difference in overall and disease free survival between premenopausal women given TAM or an irradiation menopause. For premenopausal node negative patients there would appear to be a trend in favour of the TAM treated patients with a 93% ten year survival vs. 82% for the irradiation menopause group (P = 0.09). When the disease free survival of all 961 patients is analysed, allowing for node status, then there is a marked trend in favour of the TAM treated patients (P = 0.07). Of the patients originally allocated to TAM 47% had an irradiation menopause on relapse and 73% of the postmenopausal control patients had TAM on relapse. The incidence of side effects and second primary tumours is discussed as well as the possible effects of varying the length of time over which adjuvant TAM is administered.",1
Everolimus in postmenopausal hormone-receptor-positive advanced breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Resistance to endocrine therapy in breast cancer is associated with activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) intracellular signaling pathway. In early studies, the mTOR inhibitor everolimus added to endocrine therapy showed antitumor activity. METHODS: In this phase 3, randomized trial, we compared everolimus and exemestane versus exemestane and placebo (randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio) in 724 patients with hormone-receptor-positive advanced breast cancer who had recurrence or progression while receiving previous therapy with a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor in the adjuvant setting or to treat advanced disease (or both). The primary end point was progression-free survival. Secondary end points included survival, response rate, and safety. A preplanned interim analysis was performed by an independent data and safety monitoring committee after 359 progression-free survival events were observed. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the two study groups. The median age was 62 years, 56% had visceral involvement, and 84% had hormone-sensitive disease. Previous therapy included letrozole or anastrozole (100%), tamoxifen (48%), fulvestrant (16%), and chemotherapy (68%). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were stomatitis (8% in the everolimus-plus-exemestane group vs. 1% in the placebo-plus-exemestane group), anemia (6% vs. <1%), dyspnea (4% vs. 1%), hyperglycemia (4% vs. <1%), fatigue (4% vs. 1%), and pneumonitis (3% vs. 0%). At the interim analysis, median progression-free survival was 6.9 months with everolimus plus exemestane and 2.8 months with placebo plus exemestane, according to assessments by local investigators (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35 to 0.54; P<0.001). Median progression-free survival was 10.6 months and 4.1 months, respectively, according to central assessment (hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.47; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Everolimus combined with an aromatase inhibitor improved progression-free survival in patients with hormone-receptor-positive advanced breast cancer previously treated with nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors.

Pamidronate in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced bone loss in premenopausal women with breast cancer: a randomized controlled trial.,"PURPOSE: Mortality from breast cancer has decreased in large part because of adjuvant chemotherapy. Sequelae of therapy include ovarian failure and bone loss, loss that would increase these patients' risk of fracture with aging. In this study, we assessed the efficacy of pamidronate in preventing such loss. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was a 1-yr randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing pamidronate 60 mg iv every 3 months with placebo in 40 premenopausal women with newly diagnosed breast cancer. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the spine and hip and remodeling markers were monitored over 1 yr. RESULTS: Over half of the subjects became amenorrheic, and those who did were 4 yr older than those who did not (P = 0.02). The mean difference in percent change in BMD at 12 months between the two treatment groups was 5.1% at the lumbar spine (P = 0.002) in the overall study group and 5% at the lumbar spine and 5.2% at the total hip in the amenorrheic subgroup (P < 0.03). Biochemical markers of bone remodeling did not differ between the two treatment groups, and treatment was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea is common with ensuing bone loss at the spine and hip. Pamidronate prevented bone loss at the spine and hip and was well tolerated.",0
Randomized phase II study of high-dose paclitaxel with or without amifostine in patients with metastatic breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: To determine whether the neurotoxicity of paclitaxel 250 mg/m(2) given over 3 hours every 3 weeks could be reduced by pretreatment with amifostine 910 mg/m(2). Secondary objectives included comparing myelosuppression, myalgias, and response rates of the two groups. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty women with metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive either paclitaxel alone (arm 1) or paclitaxel preceded by amifostine (arm 2). All were assessable for toxicity, and 37 were assessable for response. At baseline and after each cycle, all patients completed questionnaires for neurologic symptoms and had standardized neurologic examinations, including objective assessments of power and vibration sense. In addition, standard follow-up assessments for other toxicities and tumor response were undertaken. Changes from baseline after courses 1, 2, and 3 were assessed. The sample size was sufficient to detect a 50% improvement in the expected determination in sensory change. RESULTS: There were no differences observed in any of the measures of neurotoxicity. Other toxicity was similar in arms 1 and 2, including hair loss (95% v 90%), neurosensory changes (100% v 100%), fatigue/lethargy (85% v 90%), myalgia (95% v 90%), and grade 4 neutropenia (47% v 60%). Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, hypotension, and sneezing were more common in the amifostine arm. Response rates (22.2% v 36.8%) and paclitaxel pharmacokinetics were not significantly different. CONCLUSION: There was no protection from paclitaxel-related neurotoxicity or hematologic toxicity in this study. These results suggest that the mechanism of action of paclitaxel-related toxic effects is not amenable to the cytoprotective action of amifostine.",1
Identification of a subgroup of patients with breast cancer and histologically positive axillary nodes receiving adjuvant chemotherapy who may benefit from postoperative radiotherapy.,"Risk factors for isolated local-regional (LR) recurrence following mastectomy for breast cancer were analyzed in a review of 627 women entered into Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) adjuvant chemotherapy trials between 1978 and 1982. Premenopausal patients were randomized to cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (5-FU) (CMF), cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-FU, and prednisone (CMFP), or cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-FU, prednisone, and tamoxifen (CMFPT). Postmenopausal patients were randomized to observation, CMFP, or CMFPT. Median follow-up time was 4.5 years. At 3 years, 225 patients relapsed and in 70 (31% of failures, 11% of all patients) the initial site was LR without distant metastases. In a multivariate analysis, the risk of an isolated LR recurrence significantly correlated with the number of positive axillary nodes, the primary tumor size, the presence of tumor necrosis, and the number of axillary nodes examined. Factors that significantly discriminated between an isolated LR recurrence and distant metastasis were the number of positive nodes and primary tumor size. Patients with four to seven positive nodes or tumor size greater than or equal to 5 cm had a chance of developing an isolated LR recurrence almost equal to the risk of distant metastases. These findings suggest a potential for improved survival in this subset of patients with the addition of postmastectomy radiation to chemotherapy, and continue to emphasize the presence of a group of patients at high risk for isolated LR recurrence despite adjuvant chemotherapy.",0
Corticosteroids significantly delay the onset of docetaxel-induced fluid retention: final results of a randomized study of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Investigational Drug Branch for Breast Cancer.,"PURPOSE: To confirm the efficacy of docetaxel in patients with breast cancer previously treated with one chemotherapy regimen for advanced or metastatic disease and to compare the incidence of fluid retention (FR) and skin toxicity when docetaxel is administered with and without prophylactic corticosteroids. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-three patients, pretreated with one chemotherapy regimen for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) with bidimensionally measurable and progressive disease, were eligible for this randomized trial. Docetaxel with prophylactic oral antihistamine was administered at a dose of 50 mg/m2 as a 1-hour infusion on days 1 and 8 every 21 days and patients were randomized to receive methylprednisolone (40 mg days -1, 0, 1, 7, 8, and 9 of each cycle) (arm A) or no methylprednisolone (arm B). RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (34%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 23% to 45%) achieved on objective response. The median time to disease progression and median overall survival time were 5 and 13.5 months, respectively. In total, 415 cycles of docetaxel were administered (arm A: N = 219, median = six; arm B: N = 196, median = five). The most common toxicity observed was grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, which occurred in 79% of patients. Clinically significant nonhematologic side effects included skin reactions and asthenia. In an intent-to-treat analysis, patients who received methylprednisolone premedication had a delayed onset of FR (median time to onset of FR: arm A, 84 days; arm B, 62 days; P = .01) and received a higher median cumulative dose of docetaxel before the onset of FR (arm A, 333 mg/m2; arm B, 215 mg/m2; P = .001). There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of skin toxicity between the two arms. CONCLUSION: Docetaxel, at this dose and schedule, has definite antitumor activity in pretreated MBC patients. Moreover, this is the first randomized trial to show that corticosteroids have a favorable impact on docetaxel-induced FR.",0
"Doxorubicin and paclitaxel versus fluorouracil, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide as first-line therapy for women with advanced breast cancer: long-term analysis of the previously published trial.","BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to perform an independent review of the efficacy data and to determine whether the efficacy difference observed in a phase III randomised clinical trial that compared doxorubicin plus paclitaxel (AT) versus fluorouracil/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (FAC) in first-line chemotherapy of metastatic breast cancer was maintained after a longer follow-up period. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A blinded independent review of original radiological images and original case report forms (CRFs) was conducted by an expert radiologist and an expert medical oncologist, respectively. The analysis of the updated data included time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: CRFs for all 267 patients randomised in the study were available for medical review. The results of the independent review were consistent with the original analysis. At a median follow-up of 69 months, the difference in median TTP and OS in favour of the AT arm remained significant (median TTP 8.1 vs. 6.2 months, (p = 0.036); OS 23.0 vs. 18.3 months, (p = 0.005), respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This blinded independent review and analysis of updated data confirmed the advantage for AT over FAC with regard to TTP and OS in patients with metastatic breast cancer.",0
A phase III randomized trial comparing adjuvant concomitant chemoradiotherapy versus standard adjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy in operable node-positive breast cancer: final results.,"PURPOSE: To compare concomitant and sequential adjuvant chemoradiotherapy regimens in node-positive, operable breast cancer patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This was a randomized, French, multicenter, phase III trial enrolling 638 eligible women with prior breast surgery and positive axillary dissection. Patients in Arm A received 500 mg/m2 5-fluorouracil, 12 mg/m2 mitoxantrone, and 500 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide, with concomitant radiotherapy (50 Gy +/- 10-20-Gy boost). Patients in Arm B received 500 mg/m2 5-fluorouracil, 60 mg/m2 epirubicin, and 500 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide, with subsequent radiotherapy. Chemotherapy was administered on Day 1 every 21 days for 4 cycles. RESULTS: Median treatment durations were 64 and 126 days (Arms A and B, respectively), with no significant difference in overall or disease-free survival. Five-year locoregional relapse-free survival favored patients with conservative surgery (two thirds of the population), with less local and/or regional recurrence in Arm A than in Arm B (3% vs. 9%; p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis in this subgroup showed a 2.8-fold increased risk of locoregional recurrence with sequential chemoradiotherapy, independent of other prognostic factors (p = 0.027). Febrile neutropenia and Grade 3-4 leukopenia were significantly more frequent in Arm A. Subclinical left ventricular ejection fraction events at 1 year were more frequent with concomitant radiotherapy (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant radiotherapy with adjuvant fluorouracil, mitoxantrone, and cyclophosphamide has significantly better locoregional control in node-positive breast cancer after conservative surgery and 50% shorter treatment, albeit with slightly more acute toxicity. With mitoxantrone no longer available for adjuvant breast cancer treatment, alternative concomitant chemoradiotherapy studies are needed.",1
Different doses of epirubicin associated with fixed doses of cyclophosphamide and 5-fluorouracil: a randomised study in advanced breast cancer.,,1
Randomized phase II study of BR96-doxorubicin conjugate in patients with metastatic breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: BMS-182248-1 (BR96-doxorubicin immunoconjugate) is a chimeric human/mouse monoclonal antibody linked to approximately eight doxorubicin molecules. The antibody is directed against the Lewis-Y antigen, which is expressed on 75% of all breast cancers but is limited in expression on normal tissues. Preclinical xenograft models demonstrated significant antitumor activity, including cures. A randomized phase II design was chosen to estimate the activity of the BR96-doxorubicin conjugate in metastatic breast cancer in a study population with confirmed sensitivity to single-agent doxorubicin. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with measurable metastatic breast cancer and immunohistochemical evidence of Lewis-Y expression on their tumor received either BR96-doxorubicin conjugate 700 mg/m2 IV over 24 hours or doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. Patients were stratified on the basis of prior doxorubicin exposure, visceral disease, and institution. Cross-over to the opposite treatment arm was allowed with progressive or persistently stable disease. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients who had received a median of one prior chemotherapy regimen were assessable. There was one partial response (7%) in 14 patients receiving the BR96-doxorubicin conjugate and one complete response and three partial responses (44%) in nine assessable patients receiving doxorubicin. No patient experienced a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction. The toxicities were significantly different between the two treatment groups, with the BR96-doxorubicin conjugate group having limited hematologic toxicity, whereas gastrointestinal toxicities, including marked serum amylase and lipase elevations, nausea, and vomiting with gastritis, were prominent. CONCLUSION: The BR96-doxorubicin immunoconjugate has limited clinical antitumor activity in metastatic breast cancer. The gastrointestinal toxicities likely represent binding of the agent to normal tissues expressing the target antigen and may have compromised the delivery of the immunoconjugate to the tumor sites.",1
Maintenance treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate in patients with advanced breast cancer responding to chemotherapy: results of a randomized trial. Essen Breast Cancer Study Group.,"The purpose of this randomized phase III trial was to study whether medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) maintenance treatment prolongs the time to progression in advanced breast cancer patients responding to an induction chemotherapy. Patients with progressive advanced breast cancer previously untreated with anthracylines and progestins were given epirubicin (30 mg/m2) and ifosfamide (2 g/m2) on days 1 and 8 at 3-weekly intervals. Patients without disease progression after 6 cycles of chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive, until progression, either no treatment or MPA at a daily total dose of 500 mg. Ninety patients were randomized: 46 to the MPA arm and 44 to the observation arm. Median time to progression was longer in the MPA arm: 4.9 months versus 3.7 months in the intent-to-treat analysis (p = 0.02), and 4.9 months versus 3.0 months in the secondary efficacy analysis (p = 0.012). Seven patients were removed from MPA due to side effects. The changes in patient-rated quality of life scores were similar in both groups. The median length of survival from randomization was 17.4 months for patients receiving MPA and 18.3 months for patients randomized to observation (p = 0.39). In conclusion, in patients with advanced breast cancer achieving remission or non-progression with 6 cycles of epirubicin and ifosfamide chemotherapy, MPA maintenance treatment led to a significant, though modest, prolongation of the time to progression without affecting overall survival of the study patients.",1
"A comparison of cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, and 5-fluorouracil (CAF) and cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, vincristine, and prednisone (CMFVP) in patients with advanced breast cancer.","The Southeastern Cancer Study Group, in a prospectively randomized study involving patients with advanced breast cancer, has compared a low dose intermittently administered five-drug regimen including cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, vincristine, and prednisone (CMFVP) with an aggressively administered three-drug regimen including cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and 5-fluorouracil (CAF). CAF induced more responses and more complete responses and a longer duration of disease control. However, only a marginal difference was demonstrated in overall survival between the two regimens (p = less than 0.10). Patients with a good risk pattern of metastases, i.e. those with nodular local chest wall recurrence, nodular pulmonary metastases, or bone-only metastases were more likely to achieve a response and survive longer than those with a poor risk pattern, i.e. lymphangitic pulmonary metastases, pleural effusion with chest wall ulceration, or widespread metastases, including hepatic. All of the differences between the two regimens were noted in the good risk pattern groups. CAF provided no additional benefit to patients presenting with poor risk patterns of metastases. Adriamycin-containing combinations may achieve a greater degree of tumor cell kill in certain subsets of patients with advanced breast cancer, but this provides only a marginal increase in survival.",1
"Fulvestrant, formerly ICI 182,780, is as effective as anastrozole in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer progressing after prior endocrine treatment.","PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of fulvestrant (formerly ICI 182,780) and anastrozole in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer progressing after prior endocrine treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (n = 451) with advanced breast cancer were randomized to receive fulvestrant 250 mg as a once-monthly (one x 5 mL) intramuscular injection or an oral dose of anastrozole 1 mg in this open, parallel-group, multicenter trial. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP). Secondary end points included objective response (OR) rates, defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), duration of response (DOR), and tolerability. RESULTS: Patients were followed for a median period of 14.4 months. In terms of TTP, fulvestrant was as effective as anastrozole (hazard ratio, 0.98; confidence interval [CI], 0.80 to 1.21; P =.84). Median TTP was 5.5 months for fulvestrant and 5.1 months for anastrozole. OR rates showed a numerical advantage for fulvestrant (20.7%) over anastrozole (15.7%) (odds ratio, 1.38; CI, 0.84 to 2.29; P =.20). Clinical benefit rates (CR + PR + stable disease > or = 24 weeks) were 44.6% for fulvestrant and 45.0% for anastrozole. Median DOR was 14.3 months for fulvestrant and 14.0 months for anastrozole. Both treatments were well tolerated, with 3.2% and 1.3% of fulvestrant- and anastrozole-treated patients, respectively, withdrawn from treatment because of an adverse event. CONCLUSION: Fulvestrant was as effective as anastrozole. These data confirm that fulvestrant is an additional, effective, and well-tolerated treatment for advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women whose disease progressed on prior endocrine therapy.",1
Weekly adriamycin versus VAC in advanced breast cancer. A randomized trial.,"In a prospective randomised study 128 patients with advanced breast cancer were treated either with Adriamycin (20 mg/week) or vincristine, Adriamycin and cyclophosphamide (VAC). An objective response was obtained in 31 and 35% of patients in the two groups. There was no significant difference with regard to duration of response or survival. Weekly low dose Adriamycin was well tolerated. When subjective side effects occurred, they were usually slight and transient. In approx. 40% of the patients no side-effects at all were observed. Eight per cent had alopecia requiring a wig. Only slight myelosuppression could be seen in a few patients and this had no practical implications. Most or all of VAC patients experienced severe toxicity with regard to nausea, vomiting and alopecia. Also myelosuppression was more pronounced among VAC patients. It is concluded that weekly doses of Adriamycin as single agent therapy for advanced breast cancer is as effective as the VAC combination delivered every third week, with considerably less toxicity.",1
Oral versus intramuscular high-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate (HD-MPA) in advanced breast cancer. A randomized study of the Belgian Society of Medical Oncology.,"Ninety postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer were randomly assigned to be treated with HD-MPA administered either by oral route (daily dose 900 mg) or by intramuscular injections (1 g IM daily X 5 q w during 4 consecutive weeks followed by maintenance with 1 g twice weekly). Among 78 evaluable cases, most heavily pretreated, remissions, lasting for a median duration of 11 months, were more frequent on oral (8/37 = 22%) than on IM therapy (5/41 = 12%). In both arms, high estrogen receptor levels and various clinical factors were associated with higher response rates i.e., age greater than 60, Karnofsky greater than 70, light prior systemic treatment. Side-effects, consisting mainly of weight gain, hypertension and tremor occurred with equal frequency on oral or IM treatment. Five patients complained of pain at the sites of IM injections. Thus, we recommended that, whenever possible, the oral route should be preferred. During the same study, in 20 patients (11 on oral and 9 on IM therapy), blood was drawn at 0, 30, and 60 days of treatment for the assessment of MPA and hormone levels. In both arms, at 60 days, comparable levels of circulating MPA were obtained, with a very significant drop of cortisol, androstenedione, and estrone. These endocrine results, together with our clinical data, indicate that HD-MPA therapy is active on estrogen-dependent tumors with the same specificity as that of other modalities aiming to suppress the adrenal function. Its antineoplastic action in humans could be ascribed at least in part to its suppressive action on the adrenals, resulting in a severe estrogenic deprivation in postmenopausal women.",1
"Comparison of toremifene and tamoxifen in post-menopausal patients with advanced breast cancer: a randomized double-blind, the 'nordic' phase III study.","The study was planned to compare, in a prospective double-blind randomized trial, the efficacy and safety of toremifene (TOR) and tamoxifen (TAM) in post-menopausal patients with advanced breast cancer who have not had prior systemic therapy for advanced disease. Four hundred and fifteen post-menopausal patients with oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive or ER-unknown advanced breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive daily either 60 mg TOR or 40 mg TAM. The patients were stratified to measurable and non-measurable but evaluable groups. They were assessed for response to therapy, time to progression (TTP), time to treatment failure (TTF), response duration, overall survival and drug toxicity. Two hundred and fourteen patients were randomized into TOR and 201 into TAM treatment. The response rate (complete + partial) was 31.3% for TOR and 37.3% for TAM (P = 0.215). The 95% confidence interval (CI) for the 6% difference was -15.1% to 3.1%. The median TTP was 7.3 months for TOR and 10.2 months for TAM (P = 0.047). The 95% CI for the hazard ratio of 0.80 was 0.64-1.00. A percentage of the TOR patients (9.8%) and the TAM patients (18.9%) discontinued the treatment prematurely (P = 0.011) for various reasons. Consequently, the median TTF of 6.3 vs 8.5 months did not differ significantly (P = 0.271). The hazard ratio was 0.89 and the subsequent 95% CI 0.73-1.09. The median overall survival was 33.0 months for TOR and 38.7 months for TAM (P = 0.645). The hazard ratio was 0.94 with 95% CI of 0.73-1.22. The transient difference in TTP may be related to an imbalance in ER content of the tumours. When only patients with ER-positive tumours were considered (n = 238), no difference between two treatments was seen (P = 0.578). TAM was associated with an overall slightly higher frequency of adverse drug reactions than TOR (44.3 vs 39.3%) and a higher discontinuation rate due to these events (3.5% vs 0.9%). Treatment-emerged moderate dizziness (P = 0.026) and cataracts (P = 0.026) were more frequent among TAM than among TOR patients. In conclusion, TOR (60 mg day(-1)) and TAM (40 mg day(-1)) are equally effective and safe in the treatment of advanced post-menopausal ER-positive or ER-unknown breast cancer.",1
Phase II trial of paclitaxel and uracil--tegafur in metastatic breast cancer. TEGATAX trial.,"UNLABELLED: This Phase II trial investigated the combination paclitaxel (P) and uracil-tegafur (UFT) in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). METHODS: Main eligibility criteria included HER-2 negative MBC, ECOG performance status of 0-2, exposure to 1-2 prior chemotherapy regimen in the metastatic setting, previous exposure to an anthracycline containing regimen either at metastatic or adjuvant setting. Each 35-day cycle consisted of P at 80 mg/m(2) by intravenous infusion on days 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29 and oral UFT at 300 mg/m(2) TID (three time a day) from days 1-28 and oral folinic acid at 90 mg QD (one a day). RESULTS: Between March 2003 and December 2007, 31 patients were enrolled. Median age was 66 years (range 44-78). All tumours were HER-2 negative and 7% were triple negative (ER, PgR, HER-2). The majority of patients had visceral disease (81%). All patients had received an anthracycline containing regimen and 74% had a previous docetaxel containing treatment. Median of 4 and 3 cycles of P and UFT were administered with a relative dose intensity of 85.3% and 94.3%, respectively. Twelve (40%)(95% CI: 22.5-57.5) confirmed ORR were observed. Stable and progression disease were reported in 43% and 17% of cases. Median Response duration was 8.4 month (95% CI: 4.9-11.7), median Time to progression was 9.5 months (95% CI: 6.6-13.8) and median Overall Survival was 23.5 months (95% CI: 16.8-37.2). Thirteen pts (43%) experienced a grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs): One death occurred related to the study drugs (febrile neutropenia). Chemotherapy was discontinued due to toxicity in 30% of pts CONCLUSIONS: Accrual was closed in January 2008 due to concerns regarding the degree and accumulative nature of AEs. Nonetheless, the ORR is encouraging and warranted further studies with adapted doses and schedules.",1
Exemestane improves survival compared with megoestrol acetate in postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer who have failed on tamoxifen. results Of a double-blind randomised phase III trial.,"Exemestane is an aromatase inactivator. 769 Postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer who had failed on tamoxifen were randomised to exemestane or megoestrol acetate in this double-blind trial. Objective response rate was similar between treatments. Median time to progression, time to treatment failure and overall survival was significantly longer with exemestane. Drug-related withdrawals and drug-related deaths were more common with megoestrol acetate.",1
Chemotherapy with or without tamoxifen in postmenopausal patients with late breast cancer. A randomized study.,"Eighty-one patients with advanced measurable breast cancer were randomized to receive only chemotherapy (Group C) or the same chemotherapy + tamoxifen (Group CH). The chemotherapeutic regimen was based on the cyclic administration of two noncross-resistant cytotoxic combinations: CMFV (cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 i.v., days 1 and 5; methotrexate, 20 mg/m2 i.v., days 1 and 4; 5-fluorouracil 325 mg/m2 i.v., days 1-5; vincristine 0.75 mg/m2 i.v., days 2 and 5) and AC (adriamycin 40 mg/m2 i.v., day 1; cyclophosphamide 200 mg/m2 i.v., days 3-5) every 4-5 weeks. Tamoxifen (10 mg) was given twice daily continuously. The treatment results were as follows in Groups C and CH, respectively: PD 19.4 and 6.3%, SD 38.9 and 18.7%, PR 27.8 and 56.2% and CR 13.9 and 18.7%. The difference in response (CR + PR) rate observed between the two treatment groups was highly significant (P less than 0.025). Median time to progression was 10.6 months in Group C and 17.2 months in Group CH (NS). Median duration of survival was 20 and 34 months, respectively (NS). In conclusion: the addition of tamoxifen to chemotherapy significantly improved the results in terms of response rate and duration of responses. A significant benefit to short-term survival was also evident.",1
A randomized comparative trial of combined versus alternating therapy with cytostatic drugs and high-dose medroxyprogesteron acetate in advanced breast cancer.,"A prospective multicenter trial was conducted in 155 consecutive patients with Stage IV breast cancer randomly allocated to receive either (1) vincristin (V) 1.2 mg/m2 (maximum dose, 2 mg), Adriamycin (A) (doxorubicin) 40 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide (C) 500 mg/m2, all intravenously on day 1, every 4 weeks, in combination with medroxyprogesteron acetate (MPA) 600 mg orally on days 1 through 14, 500 mg intramuscularly on days 1 through 28, and twice weekly afterwards (combined chemoendocrine approach) or (2) the same combination chemotherapy (VAC) for three cycles alternating with MPA in the above-mentioned dosage during 8 weeks (alternating chemoendocrine approach). Results show an overall response rate of 73% with 26% complete responses in the combined treatment arm, whereas in the alternating arm, an overall response rate of 76% with 20% complete responses was observed. In patients with more than one metastatic site, response rate was higher in the combination treatment, and only in this arm were complete responses observed in these patients. Although the median duration of response was long in both treatment arms (combination, 19 months versus alternating, 21 months), the median overall survival in both groups was not definitely prolonged (22 versus 24 months, respectively). However, results in subsets of patients suggest that the alternating chemoendocrine approach may be better for estrogen receptor (ER)-negative patients, for patients younger than 51 years of age, and for patients with a disease-free interval of 1 year or less. Patients with these parameters probably belong to the same population. It is concluded that combination of chemotherapy and high-dose MPA may be indicated in ER-positive patients when a clinical response is urgently needed. In ER-negative patients, the alternating use of both treatment modalities deserves further investigation.",1
Adriamycin plus vincristine alone or with dibromodulcitol or ICRF-159 in metastatic breast cancer.,"A total of 268 patients with metastatic breast cancer were prospectively randomized to receive Adriamycin-vincristine (AV) alone, AV plus dibromodulcitol (AVD), or AV plus ICRF-159 (AVI). Two hundred thirty were eligible and had received prior chemotherapy. The objective response rates were 27%, 23%, and 16% for AV, AVD and AVI, respectively, and an additional 44% had stabilization of disease. Duration of responses ranged from 4.1 to 4.6 months and the times to treatment failure from 2.9 to 3.8 months. Median survivals ranged from 7.1 to 8.3 months. Performance status and the presence of liver or brain metastases were significant prognostic variables for outcome. These studies show that AVI is inferior to AV with respect to survival when prognostic variables are taken into account in a multivariate model, whereas AVD which utilizes a lower dose of Adriamycin appears to have comparable antitumor activity to AV. This does not appear to offer any benefit to patients previously treated with chemotherapy, as in this trial, but it may be an advantage to previously untreated patients since Adriamycin can be administered to responding patients over a longer period of time before an unacceptable total cumulative dose is reached.",1
Epirubicin and cyclophosphamide versus epirubicin and docetaxel as first-line therapy for women with metastatic breast cancer: final results of a randomised phase III trial.,"BACKGROUND: This randomised phase III trial was carried out to compare the efficacy and safety of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (EC) with epirubicin and docetaxel (Taxotere) (ED) as first-line chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (n = 240) were randomly assigned to receive either ED (epirubicin 75 mg/m(2) and docetaxel 75 mg/m(2)) or EC (epirubicin 90 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2)). The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR). Secondary end points were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. RESULTS: ORR for patients randomly assigned to receive EC and ED were 42% and 47%, respectively (P = 0.63). Median PFS [10.1 versus 10.3 months; hazard ratio (HR) 0.98; log-rank P = 0.38] and OS (19.9 versus 30.0 months; HR 0.663; log-rank P = 0.21) were comparable in both arms. Although grade 3/4 leucopenia occurred more frequently with ED (81% versus 73%; P = 0.01), there were no significant differences in the incidence of febrile neutropenia and grade 3/4 infections. Grade 3/4 non-haematologic toxicity was infrequent in both arms. Congestive heart failure was observed in one patient in each arm. CONCLUSION: In this randomised trial, no differences in the efficacy study end points were observed between the two treatment arms.",1
Randomized trial of doxorubicin alone or combined with vincristine and mitomycin C in women with metastatic breast cancer.,"A randomized clinical trial was performed to determine if combination therapy with doxorubicin, vincristine, and mitomycin C (DVM) was superior to doxorubicin alone in women with metastatic breast cancer for whom prior chemotherapy had failed. A total of 185 women were randomized to monthly courses of D (60 mg/m2, observation after 500 mg/m2); or D (50 mg/m2, maximum cumulative dose 500 mg/m2), V (1 mg/m2), and M (10 mg/m2, given every other cycle). Patients failing after D alone could receive V (1 mg weekly for 5 weeks, then 1.2 mg/m2 every 5 weeks) plus M (12 mg/m2 every 5 weeks). Objective responses were seen in 24 of 95 patients (25%) on D alone and 39 of 90 patients (43%) on DVM (two-sided p = 0.01). The time to disease progression distribution was significantly better for DVM (two-sided p = 0.02), but the magnitude of the advantage was small with the medians being 2.7 months for D and 4.2 months for DVM. There was no significant difference in survival between the two regimens. The degree of leukopenia was greater for DVM both in terms of median white blood cell nadir (1,300/microL versus 1,700/microL) and percentage of patients with a nadir less than 1,000/microL (33% versus 16%). A total of 45 patients received VM following D alone, and only seven (16%) achieved an objective response. We conclude that, despite a significantly higher response rate and longer time to progression, the degree of clinical benefit is not sufficient to recommend the combination of DVM over D alone as second-line therapy for women with metastatic breast cancer. The level of efficacy seen with VM as tertiary therapy is low and is of such a magnitude to suggest that V adds little but toxicity to M.",1
A randomised comparative trial of mitozantrone/methotrexate/mitomycin C (MMM) and cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/5 FU (CMF) in the treatment of advanced breast cancer.,"Mitozantrone (Novantrone) has recently been incorporated into a new combination chemotherapy regimen with mitomycin-C and methotrexate (MMM) against advanced breast cancer. We have compared MMM (mitozantrone 8 mg m-2 i.v. q 3 weekly, methotrexate 35 mg m-2 i.v. q 3 weekly, mitomycin-C 8 mg m-2 i.v. q 6 weekly) with CMF (cyclophosphamide 100 mg orally, days 1-14, methotrexate 35 mg m-2 i.v., days 1 and 8, 5-FU 1,000 mg i.v., days 1 and 8, q 4 weekly), each regimen with folinic acid rescue, in a randomised trial, 29/57 evaluable patients treatment with MMM achieved an objective response (51%) compared with 33/55 treated with CMF (60%). Overall median survival was 16 months for MMM and 12 months for CMF. Subjective toxicity was low for both regimens and the only significant difference was in incidence of diarrhoea (50% for CMF vs 21% for MMM). Haematological toxicity was similar, leading to treatment delays and/or dose reductions in 35% patients with CMF vs 43% with MMM. Thrombocytopenia was significantly increased in MMM (34% vs 14%). No clinical cardiotoxicity was seen, but a significant reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction occurred in four patients on CMF vs 2 on MMM. MMM is an active, well tolerated new chemotherapy regimen for advanced/metastatic breast carcinoma with an efficacy and toxicity spectrum very similar to CMF.",1
Chemotherapy with mitoxantrone in combination with continuous infusion vinblastine for metastatic breast cancer.,"The efficacy of mitoxantrone in combination with vinblastine was assessed in 156 patients with metastatic breast cancer who had been treated previously with one or multiple chemotherapeutic regimens. Mitoxantrone was given by random assignment, either as a 10 mg/m2 single intravenous dose or in five consecutive daily fractions of 2 mg¿2. Vinblastine was given as a continuous intravenous infusion of 1.2 mg/m2 daily for 5 days. In 115 evaluable patients previously treated with doxorubicin, 21 objective responses (18%) and 11 minor responses (10%) were observed with similar distribution in the two treatment groups. Median time to progression was 27 weeks and 23 weeks, respectively. Eight (32%) of 25 patients who had not received doxorubicin achieved objective remissions and two (8%) had minor responses. Toxic effects were similar for the two treatment schedules. Major toxicities were myelosuppression and neutropenic fever. Other toxicities were mild. Cardiotoxicity, presumably caused by mitoxantrone, occurred in four patients. The combination of mitoxantrone and vinblastine appeared to offer no advantage over single-agent therapy, probably because of the dosage reduction required by the overlapping myelosuppressive toxicity.",1
"Phase III study of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF) plus leucovorin versus CAF for metastatic breast cancer: Cancer and Leukemia Group B 9140.","PURPOSE: To determine whether biochemical modulation with LV (leucovorin) enhances the efficacy of CAF (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil) against metastatic breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women with histologically confirmed stage IV breast cancer, Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) performance status 0 to 2, and no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease were randomly assigned to receive CAF (cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 day 1, doxorubicin 40 mg/m2 day 1, and fluorouracil [FU] 200 mg/m2 intravenous bolus days 1 to 5) with or without LV (LV 200 mg/m2 over 30 minutes days 1 to 5 given 1 hour before FU). RESULTS: Two hundred forty-two patients were randomly assigned to treatment; 124 patients had visceral crisis and 40 patients had a CALGB performance status score of 2. The median follow-up was 6 years. The two study arms were similar with regard to serious adverse events; four patients died from treatment-related causes, two patients on each study arm. Predictive variables for time to treatment failure and survival were visceral disease and performance status. The overall response rate was 29% for CAF versus 28% for CAF plus LV. The median time to treatment failure (9 months) and median survival (1.7 years) did not differ by treatment arm. CONCLUSION: Modulation of CAF with LV improved neither response rates nor survival among women with metastatic breast cancer, compared with CAF alone. Multivariate analyses confirmed the prognostic importance of performance status and visceral crisis. However, the overall and complete response rates, response durations, time to treatment failure, and survival were the same in the two treatment arms.",1
Treatment of metastatic breast cancer in estrogen receptor positive patients. A randomized trial comparing tamoxifen alone versus tamoxifen plus CMF.,"In a controlled clinical trial, 52 patients with ER positive metastatic breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive initial treatment with either tamoxifen alone followed by sequential cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) after tumour progression of concurrent tamoxifen plus CMF, All 52 patients entered are eligible and 50 patients were currently assessable. Response rates (CR + PR) were similar for the two treatment groups (15/24 tamoxifen alone, 17/26 tamoxifen + CMF). The median durations of survival for the two treatment groups 17.7 months and 17.1 months were also not significantly different. Significant correlations were found between level of ER and response rate and also between level of ER and response duration. From the result of this investigation it would appear that there is no advantage to the addition of chemotherapy prior to an adequate trial of hormone therapy in patients with metastatic ER positive breast cancer.",1
"FEC (5-fluorouracil, epidoxorubicin and cyclophosphamide) versus EM (epidoxorubicin and mitomycin-C) with or without lonidamine as first-line treatment for advanced breast cancer. A multicentric randomised study. Final results.","From May 1991 to December 1996, 326 patients with advanced metastatic breast cancer were enrolled in a multicentre, randomised, phase III clinical trial with four arms. Patients were randomised to receive chemotherapy according to the FEC regimen (5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 500 mg/m2, epidoxorubicin (EPI) 75 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide (CFA) 500 mg/m2, intravenously (i.v.). every 3 weeks) or the EM regimen (EPI 75 mg/m2, i.v. every 3 weeks; mitomycin C (MMC) 10 mg/m2, i.v. every 6 weeks) or the same regimens with the addition of lonidamine (LND) until disease progression (orally, thrice daily, 150+150+300 mg); a maximum of eight chemotherapy cycles were planned. The aim of the trial was 2-fold: to compare the EM regimen with the commonly used FEC regimen and to evaluate the possible role of the addition of LND. Patients were eligible if they had histologically proven breast carcinoma, metastatic or locoregional relapse with measurable and/or evaluable disease and were aged between 18 and 70 years: 318 patients were considered eligible. Patients with previous anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy or those who relapsed within 6 months after any adjuvant chemotherapy regimen were excluded. Chemotherapy-related toxicity of grade > or = 3 was manageable and there was no significant difference between the arms in terms of haematological side-effects. The impact on heart function was mild. No increased toxicity was observed in the LND arms (apart from myalgias in 27-30% of the cases). A significant increase in the complete response rate was observed for the FEC/EM + LND group (20.4%) versus the FEC/EM group (10.8%). The median survival time and the median time to progression for the overall series were 608 days and 273 days, respectively; EM+/-LND achieved significantly improved survival and time to progression versus FEC+/-LND (P=0.01). This result was confirmed also when the analysis was restricted to patients previously treated with adjuvant CMF schedules. On the basis of these results, we conclude that EM may represent a valuable alternative to FEC for patients requiring a first-line regimen for advanced/ metastatic breast carcinoma, especially in patients previously treated with CMF in an adjuvant setting. Furthermore, we conclude that, in spite of a better complete response rate in the LND arms, as there was no clear advantage in time to progression or survival resulting from the addition of LND to the FEC or EM regimens, the routine use of LND is not warranted outside a clinical trial.",1
"Phase III study of N,N-diethyl-2-[4-(phenylmethyl) phenoxy]ethanamine (BMS-217380-01) combined with doxorubicin versus doxorubicin alone in metastatic/recurrent breast cancer: National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group Study MA.19.","PURPOSE: N,N-diethyl-2-[4-(phenylmethyl)phenoxy]ethanamine (DPPE; tesmilifene) is a novel agent that augments chemotherapy cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. A phase II trial combining DPPE and doxorubicin (DOX) in metastatic breast carcinoma showed increased response over that expected with DOX. We report a phase III trial comparing DOX with DPPE plus DOX in metastatic or recurrent breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Anthracycline-naive women with measurable metastatic disease were randomly assigned to receive, every 21 days, either DOX 60 mg/m(2) intravenously or DOX during the last 20 minutes of an 80-minute infusion of DPPE (5.3 mg/kg), in both cases to cumulative DOX doses of 450 mg/m(2). Patients receiving DPPE were aggressively premedicated to ameliorate toxicity. End points included progression-free survival (PFS), response rate (RR), and response duration (RD), quality of life (QOL), toxicity, and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: A planned interim analysis failed to detect an RR difference more than 5%. The study was closed to additional accrual and all DPPE was discontinued. The final analysis was conducted as planned after 256 progression events (median follow-up, 20.5 months). There was no significant difference in RR, RD, or PFS between arms. DPPE plus DOX was statistically superior to DOX in OS (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.91; P =.021). DPPE plus DOX was associated with more gastrointestinal and CNS toxicity. No consistent influence on QOL was detected. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated no advantage in RR, RD, or PFS but significantly superior OS for DPPE plus DOX. Additional studies of DPPE are warranted.",1
"A randomized, prospective, comparative, multicentre trial of a single combination versus alternating combinations of antitumour drugs in advanced breast cancer.","A prospective, multicentre trial was conducted in 262 patients with advanced breast cancer randomized to receive every 3 weeks either: (i) a single five-drug combination of adriamycin (50 mg), vincristine (1.5 mg) and 5-fluorouracil (750 mg) given intravenously; with methotrexate (50 mg) intramuscularly and chlorambucil (10 mg) orally all at time zero, followed by three further doses of chlorambucil (10 mg) at 6-h intervals, or (ii) one course of two alternating three-drug combinations consisting of regimen A--vincristine (1.5 mg), adriamycin (70 mg) and methotrexate (50 mg) and regimen B--5-fluorouracil (750 mg) and vindesine (5 mg) intravenously with cyclophosphamide (50 mg) orally at time zero, followed by three further doses of cyclophosphamide (50 mg) at 6-h intervals. Results show that overall response rates to chemotherapy were comparable in the two arms of this study being 63% (83 of 131 patients) for the single combination and 64% (84 of 131 patients) for the alternating combinations. Response rates according to menopausal status indicate no significant difference for the two arms of this study. However overall, combining all patients treated with either the single or the alternating combinations, post-menopausal patients had a significantly lower response rate (57%) compared with pre-menopausal patients (76%), P less than 0.05. Overall serious side-effects were minimal and were similar in both treatment groups. Response durations and overall survival data, which are essentially similar for the two treatment groups, proved disappointing with a median response duration of only approx. 6 months and overall median survival only slightly in excess of 1 year. Alternative treatment approaches are needed to maintain the remissions initially achieved in metastatic breast cancer.",1
Fadrozole hydrochloride in postmenopausal patients with metastatic breast carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: Fadrozole hydrochloride (CGS-16949A) belongs to the class of aromatase inhibitors that lowers circulating estrogen levels by inhibiting the conversion of androgens to estrogens, thereby causing tumor regression in patients with breast carcinoma. METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, Phase II study of fadrozole hydrochloride in postmenopausal patients with metastatic breast carcinoma. The three treatment groups received, respectively, fadrozole hydrochloride 0.6 mg three times daily, 1 mg twice daily, and 2 mg twice daily orally. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients were entered on protocol and 54 were eligible (2 patients were perimenopausal). Eight patients had received no prior therapy, 15 patients had received prior hormonal therapy, 5 patients had received prior chemotherapy, and 28 patients had received both. After 12 weeks of treatment, 2 complete and 3 partial responses were observed. Forty patients continued treatment beyond 12 weeks, and 3 additional responses were achieved. Thus, 8 of 56 patients responded (14% overall response rate). Responses did not appear to be dose-related. The median duration of response was 36 months (range, 8-45 months). Subjective toxicity was mild to moderate and appeared more frequent on the 2 mg twice daily dosing schedule. No objective toxicity in laboratory parameters was observed. No patient had severe or life-threatening toxicity. Fadrozole hydrochloride plasma concentrations (obtained every 2 weeks for 12 weeks) appeared to be dose-dependent and noncumulative. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms modest activity of fadrozole hydrochloride in a heterogeneous group of patients with breast carcinoma treated at three different dose levels.",1
Phase III randomized trial of droloxifene and tamoxifen as first-line endocrine treatment of ER/PgR-positive advanced breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: This trial was designed to demonstrate equivalence between droloxifene 40 mg/d and tamoxifen 20 mg/d as first-line treatment in pre- and post-menopausal women with ER+ and/or PgR+ advanced breast cancer based on time to disease progression and tumor response. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One thousand three hundred fifty four women with measurable disease, previously untreated by hormonal or chemotherapy for advanced or recurrent breast cancer, were enrolled by 179 institutions in 35 countries. Patients were stratified at baseline for menopausal status. Patients receiving adjuvant hormonal therapy within I year were excluded. All patients gave written informed consent, were randomized to 40mg droloxifene or 20 mg tamoxifen daily as single-agent therapy and underwent tumor assessment every 3 months. A central committee reviewed digitized images for all cases of tumor progression or objective response. RESULTS: The hazard ratio (droloxifene/tamoxifen) for the primary endpoint, time to disease progression, was 1.287 favoring tamoxifen (95% C.I.: 1.114-1.487; p <.001). The objective response rate (CR+PR) was 22.4% for droloxifene and 28.6% for tamoxifen (p = .02). Tamoxifen was superior to droloxifene overall, among both pre- and postmenopausal patients and among patients < or =65 years; there was no difference among women >65 years. The hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 0.871 (95% C.I.: 0.672-1.129; p = .29), favoring droloxifene but not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Droloxifene was significantly less effective than tamoxifen overall and particularly among women under 65 years. Tamoxifen and droloxifene were both less effective in pre-menopausal women with receptor-positive disease compared to post-menopausal women. Further clinical development of droloxifene was stopped.",1
Prospective randomized trial of docetaxel versus mitomycin plus vinblastine in patients with metastatic breast cancer progressing despite previous anthracycline-containing chemotherapy. 304 Study Group.,"PURPOSE: This phase III study compared docetaxel with mitomycin plus vinblastine (MV) in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) progressing despite previous anthracycline-containing chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (n=392) were randomized to receive either docetaxel 100 mg/m2 intravenously (i.v.) every 3 weeks (n=203) or mitomycin 12 mg/m2 i.v. every 6 weeks plus vinblastine 6 mg/m2 i.v. every 3 weeks (n=189), for a maximum of 10 3-week cycles. RESULTS: In an intention-to-treat analysis, docetaxel produced significantly higher response rates than MV overall (30.0% v 11.6%; P < .0001), as well as in patients with visceral involvement (30% v 11%), liver metastases (33% v 7%), or resistance to previous anthracycline agents (30% v 7%). Median time to progression (TTP) and overall survival were significantly longer with docetaxel than MV (19 v 1 weeks, P=.001, and 1 1.4 v 8.7 months, P=.0097, respectively). Neutropenia grade 3/4 was more frequent with docetaxel (93.1 % v62.5%; P < .05); thrombocytopenia grade 3/4 was more frequent with MV (12.0% v 4.1%; P < .05). Severe acute or chronic nonhematologic adverse events were infrequent in both groups. Withdrawal rates because of adverse events (MV, 10.1%; docetaxel, 13.8%) or toxic death (MV, 1.6%; docetaxel, 2.0%) were similar in both groups. Quality-of-life analysis was limited by a number of factors, but results were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: Docetaxel is significantly superior to MV in terms of response, TTP, and survival. The safety profiles of both therapies are manageable and tolerable. Docetaxel represents a clear treatment option for patients with MBC progressing despite previous anthracycline-containing chemotherapy.",1
"Phase III, double-blind, randomized study comparing lapatinib plus paclitaxel with placebo plus paclitaxel as first-line treatment for metastatic breast cancer.","PURPOSE: Lapatinib, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ErbB1) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2/ErbB2), is effective against HER-2-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC). This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy of lapatinib in HER-2-negative and HER-2-uncharacterized MBC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women with MBC were randomly assigned to first-line therapy with paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks plus lapatinib 1,500 mg/d or placebo. A preplanned retrospective evaluation of HER-2 status was performed using fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP); secondary end points were objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: In the intent-to-treat population (n = 579), there were no significant differences in TTP, EFS, or OS between treatment arms, although differences in ORR and CBR were noted. In 86 HER-2-positive patients (15%), treatment with paclitaxel-lapatinib resulted in statistically significant improvements in TTP, EFS, ORR, and CBR compared with paclitaxel-placebo. No differences between treatment groups were observed for any end point in HER-2-negative patients. The most common adverse events were alopecia, rash, and diarrhea. The incidence of diarrhea and rash was significantly higher in the paclitaxel-lapatinib arm. The rate of cardiac events was low, and no difference was observed between treatment arms.CONCLUSION: Patients with HER-2-negative or HER-2-untested MBC did not benefit from the addition of lapatinib to paclitaxel. However, first-line therapy with paclitaxel-lapatinib significantly improved clinical outcomes in HER-2-positive patients. Prospective evaluation of the efficacy and safety of this combination is ongoing in early and metastatic HER-2-positive breast cancer patients.",1
Combination chemotherapy compared to tamoxifen as initial therapy for stage IV breast cancer in elderly women.,"In a randomized crossover study, 181 patients over the age of 65 with recurrent breast cancer received either tamoxifen or cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF). After progression on tamoxifen, a hormone withdrawal period was required. Because of altered pharmacokinetics with aging, creatinine clearance was used in calculating the dose of CMF. Response rates were 45% on tamoxifen and 38% on CMF, with median durations of 10.4 and 7.9 months, respectively. Survival rates tended to favor tamoxifen as the initial treatment even in estrogen-receptor-negative patients. Additional disease control with hormone withdrawal occurred in 23% of patients, and this benefit was highly correlated with prior hormone response. We conclude that initiation of hormone therapy rather than CMF chemotherapy is justified in almost all situations in elderly patients, and combination chemotherapy, is safe and useful after hormone failure if modified on the basis of renal dysfunction.",1
"Influence of treatment schedule on toxicity and efficacy of cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and fluorouracil in metastatic breast cancer: a randomized trial comparing weekly and every-4-week administration.","PURPOSE: To compare the effect on toxicity and efficacy of the fluorouracil 500 mg/m2, epirubicin 60 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (FEC) regimen divided into 4 weekly doses with conventional every-4-week administration in metastatic breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The inclusion criteria demanded measurable or assessable metastases from breast cancer and a World Health Organization (WHO) performance index of 2 or less. One hundred seventy-three patients with metastatic breast cancer who had not been treated with anthracyclines were randomized to receive FEC once every 4 weeks or once a week. The scheduled monthly doses of the cytotoxic agents were identical in both groups. Three patients were excluded from analysis. RESULTS: Hematologic toxicity, alopecia, nausea, and vomiting were significantly more severe in the group that received treatment every 4 weeks. The response rate was higher in the group that received FEC every 4 weeks than in the group treated weekly (47% v 30%, P = .02). Time to progression was significantly (P = .005) longer with every-4-week FEC treatment (median, 9.2 months v 5.4 months for weekly treatment). Patients in the group treated every 4 weeks lived significantly (P = .01) longer than patients treated weekly (median survival times, 21.2 months v 11.8 months, respectively). The actually delivered monthly dose levels and treatment duration were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSION: Both efficacy and toxicity of FEC were greater when treatment was administered every 4 weeks rather than once a week, despite identical dose intensity.",1
Doubling epirubicin dose intensity (100 mg/m2 versus 50 mg/m2) in the FEC regimen significantly increases response rates. An international randomised phase III study in metastatic breast cancer. The Epirubicin High Dose (HEPI 010) Study Group.,"PURPOSE: A phase III study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) to evaluate the effect on response rate and survival of a doubling of the epirubicin dose intensity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred fifty-six patients were randomised to receive either epirubicin 100 mg/m2 or 50 mg/m2 in combination with 5-FU (500 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) (FEC 100 vs. FEC 50) i.v., every 21 days for a maximum of six cycles (eight in case of CR). RESULTS: Of 456 patients, 390 were evaluable for efficacy. Objective response (CR + PR) was seen in 57% (FEC 100) vs. 41% (FEC 50) of the evaluable patients (P = 0.003). The CR rate was higher in the FEC 100 arm (12% vs. 7%, P = 0.07). FEC 100 produced significantly higher response rates in patients with visceral localisation (50% vs. 34%, P = 0.011) and in patients with more than two metastatic organ sites (64% vs. 37%, P = 0.001). Median time to progression (7.6 vs. 7 months) and overall survival (18 months vs. 17 months) were similar. Myelosuppression was the principal toxic effect, with grade IV neutropenia observed in 57% of the patients treated with FEC 100 vs. 9% of those on FEC 50. Grade IV infection or febrile neutropenia were observed in 8% (FEC 100) vs. 0.4% (FEC 50), but the incidence of septic death was the same in the two arms (two patients each). Cardiac toxicity was similar in the two treatment groups, with 5% vs. 3% of the patients taken off study due to cardiac events, primarily due to a decline in LVEF. Only three patients (two in FEC 100) experienced congestive heart failure. CONCLUSION: This trial shows that FEC with epirubicin at 100 mg/m2 can be administered for repeated cycles without bone marrow support with increased, though acceptable, toxicity and with a significant increase of antitumor effect (especially in visceral and/or high-burden disease), but no increased survival.",1
Phase III randomized trial of toremifene vs tamoxifen in hormonodependant advanced breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: Efficacy and safety of toremifene (TOR) 60 mgs/dayly/o.r. was compared with tamoxifen (TAM) 40 mgs/dayly/o.r. in a group of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer, without previous systemic therapy for advanced breast cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was a prospective double-blind randomized trial. All treated patients presented with positive estrogen receptors. Main end points were response rates, toxicity profile analysis, time to progression and survival. WHO and ECOG criteria were employed for response evaluation while toxicity was assesed according to WHO guidelines. Curves were constructed by means of Kaplan-Meier methodology and were compared by means of log-rank test. RESULTS: From January 1996 to January 1999 a total of 217 patients were included in the study (106 in the TOR branch and 111 in the TAM arm). Both groups of patients were homogeneous regarding the main prognostic factors. A response rate of 64% (68/106) was observed in the TOR group as compared with a 52% (58/111) in the TAM group. Median times to progression and overall survival were not significantly different. A lower incidence of undesirable effects was apreciated in the TOR arm. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that TOR is an efficient and well-tolerated agent for the therapy of postmenopausal women with hormonal positive receptors advanced breast cancer, and must be considered an alternative to TAM as first line therapy for ER+ advanced breast cancer patients and as well as an adjuvant treatment.",1
A randomised phase III cross-over study of tamoxifen versus megestrol acetate in advanced and recurrent breast cancer.,"139 peri- and postmenopausal women with advanced or recurrent breast cancer who had not received prior hormonal therapy were randomised in an open, cross-over study comparing the synthetic progestogen megestrol acetate with tamoxifen. The response rate (CR/PR) to megestrol acetate (25%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 15-35%) was not significantly different from that produced by tamoxifen (33%, CI 22-44%). Time-to-treatment failure was also similar in the two groups. Cross-over treatment was given on progression in 76 cases. Cross-over response (CR/PR) was seen in 3 of 35 patients (9%) receiving megestrol acetate as second-line therapy and in 6 of 41 patients (15%) receiving tamoxifen second-line. There was no significant difference in survival between the groups (P = 0.17) with median survival times of 24 and 32 months for the megestrol acetate and tamoxifen groups, respectively. The toxicity profile of the two drugs was different, although significant toxicity was rare with either agent. Megestrol acetate is an effective treatment for advanced breast cancer in older women when used either as first- or second-line treatment. Cross-over response is seen following both treatments. Given that most patients now receive tamoxifen as adjuvant treatment, megestrol acetate would appear to be one of the logical choices for patients who find the side-effects of tamoxifen unacceptable and for those who relapse on tamoxifen with further hormone therapy being clinically indicated.",1
Randomized phase III trial of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin versus vinorelbine or mitomycin C plus vinblastine in women with taxane-refractory advanced breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) with that of a common salvage regimen (comparator) in patients with taxane-refractory advanced breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Following failure of a first- or second-line taxane-containing regimen for metastatic disease, 301 women were randomly assigned to receive PLD (50 mg/m(2) every 28 days); or comparator-vinorelbine (30 mg/m(2) weekly) or mitomycin C (10 mg/m(2) day 1 and every 28 days) plus vinblastine (5 mg/m(2) day 1, day 14, day 28, and day 42) every 6 to 8 weeks. Patients were stratified before random assignment based on number of previous chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease and presence of bone metastases only. RESULTS: Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were similar for PLD and comparator (PFS: hazard ratio [HR], 1.26; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.62; P =.11; median, 2.9 months [PLD] and 2.5 months [comparator]; OS: HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.33; P =.71; median, 11.0 months [PLD] and 9.0 months [comparator]). In anthracycline-naïve patients, PFS was somewhat longer with PLD, relative to the comparator (n = 44; median PFS, 5.8 v 2.1 months; HR, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.16 to 4.95; P =.01). Most frequently reported adverse events were nausea (23% to 31%), vomiting (17% to 20%), and fatigue (9% to 20%) and were similar among treatment groups. PLD-treated patients experienced more palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (37%; 18% grade 3, 1 patient grade 4) and stomatitis (22%; 5% grades 3/4). Neuropathy (11%), constipation (16%), and neutropenia (14%) were more common with vinorelbine. Alopecia was low in both the PLD and vinorelbine groups (3% and 5%). CONCLUSION: PLD has efficacy comparable to that of common salvage regimens in patients with taxane-refractory metastatic breast cancer, thereby representing a useful therapeutic option.",1
Efficacy of first-line letrozole versus tamoxifen as a function of age in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy, in regard to time to progression (TTP) and objective response rate (ORR), of letrozole (Femara; Novartis Pharma AG; Basel Switzerland), an oral aromatase inhibitor, with that of tamoxifen (Tamofen; Leiras OY; Turku, Finland) as first-line therapy in younger (<70 years) and older (>/=70 years) postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine hundred seven patients with advanced breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive 2.5 mg letrozole (n = 453) or 20 mg tamoxifen (n = 454) once daily in a double-blind, multicenter, international trial. Among the prospectively planned analyses were analyses of TTP and ORR by age (<70 and >/=70 years). The results of these prospectively planned analyses are reported here. RESULTS: Letrozole was as effective in older postmenopausal women (>/=70 years of age) as it was in younger postmenopausal women (<70 years of age). The overall ORR in the older subgroup was significantly higher in patients treated with letrozole (38%) than in patients treated with tamoxifen (18%). In the younger subgroup of postmenopausal patients, the ORRs were not significantly different (letrozole, 26%; tamoxifen, 22%). TTP was significantly longer for letrozole than for tamoxifen in both age groups (younger: letrozole median TTP, 8.8 months; tamoxifen, 6.0 months; older: letrozole median TTP, 12.2 months; tamoxifen, 5.8 months). Although age was independently prognostic of TTP, there was no significant effect of age on ORR in the presence of other factors. CONCLUSION: The data show that letrozole, 2.5 mg once daily, is as effective in older, postmenopausal women as it is in younger postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer. In addition, letrozole was more effective than tamoxifen in both younger and older patients.",1
A Southwest Oncology Group Randomized Phase II Study of doxorubicin and paclitaxel as frontline chemotherapy for women with metastatic breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate whether the high complete response (CR) rates for the combination of doxorubicin and paclitaxel in metastatic breast cancer observed in two European studies could be replicated in a multi-institutional cooperative group trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a phase II study with 91 patients randomized between either doxorubicin (60 mg/m(2)) followed immediately by paclitaxel (200 mg/m(2) over 3 h) (AT), or with doxorubicin (60 mg/m(2)) followed immediately by cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m(2)) (AC). Treatment was limited to six cycles of therapy for the doxorubicin and paclitaxel combination. Left ventricular ejection fraction was evaluated at on study and after four and six cycles of treatment on AT. RESULTS: Estimates of overall objective response were 31% (with 9% CR) and 39% (with 11% CR) for patients on the AT and AC regimens, respectively. Response was lower than anticipated on the standard AC arm. On average the reduction of LVEF was similar in the two groups, with no patients developing congestive heart failure during the six cycles of therapy, although one patient in the AT group died of delayed congestive heart failure. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this multi-institutional study in patients with metastatic breast cancer suggest that the combination of doxorubicin and paclitaxel is well tolerated with relatively low rates of cardiac toxicity if the total dose of doxorubicin is held to <or=360 mg/m(2). However, the CR rates achieved with this combination are probably more modest than initial single institution studies might suggest.",1
Multicenter phase II randomized trial evaluating antiangiogenic therapy with sunitinib as consolidation after objective response to taxane chemotherapy in women with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer.,"The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that antiangiogenic treatment with sunitinib consolidation can prolong remissions induced by taxane-based chemotherapy in women with metastatic breast cancer. The method involves a two-arm open-label (2:1 randomization) multicenter, randomized phase II trial evaluating the efficacy of sunitinib (arm A) versus no therapy (arm B) in patients with HER-2-negative metastatic breast cancer who achieved an objective response to taxane-based chemotherapy. The results of this study indicates that the primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) > or =5 months was achieved in 10 of 36 patients (28%) in arm A and 4 of 19 patients (21%) in arm B. The median PFS was 2.8 and 3.1 months, respectively. A protocol amendment to the sunitinib dosing schedule was made because 53% (17/32) of patients treated at a starting dose of 50 mg (4 weeks on/2 weeks off) required dose reduction. Changing the starting dose to sunitinib 37.5 mg continuously resulted in dose reductions in 44% (7/16) of patients. Grades III-IV toxicity occurred in 69% of patients in arm A (fatigue 31%, musculoskeletal pain 11%, neutropenia and thrombopenia 8%) and 11% in arm B. The proof-of-principle study does not confirm the hypothesis that sunitinib consolidation therapy can lead to a predefined clinically relevant proportion of patients with PFS of > or =5 months after an objective response to taxanes. Furthermore, toxicity was significant.",1
Phase II multicentre randomised study of docetaxel plus epirubicin vs 5-fluorouracil plus epirubicin and cyclophosphamide in metastatic breast cancer.,"The purpose of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of docetaxel plus epirubicin (ET) and of 5-fluorouracil plus epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (FEC) as first-line chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer. A total of 142 patients (intent-to-treat (ITT)) with at least one measurable lesion were randomised to receive docetaxel 75 mg m(-2) plus epirubicin 75 mg m(-2) or 5-fluorouracil 500 mg m(-2) plus epirubicin 75 mg m(-2) and cyclophosphamide 500 mg m(-2) intravenously once every 3 weeks for up to eight cycles. Prophylactic granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor was only permitted after the first cycle, if required. Per-protocol analysis (n=132) gave an overall response rate for ET of 63.1% (95% confidence interval (CI), 50-78%) and for FEC 34.3% (95% CI, 23-47%) after a median seven and six cycles, respectively. Intent-to-treat population (n=142) gave an overall response rate for ET of 59% (95% CI, 47-70%) and for FEC 32% (95% CI, 21-43%) after a median seven and six cycles, respectively. The median response duration for ET was 8.6 months (95% CI, 7.2-9.6 months) and for FEC 7.8 months (95% CI, 6.5-10.4 months). The median time to progression (ITT) for ET was 7.8 months (95% CI, 5.8-9.6 months) and for FEC 5.9 months (95% CI, 4.6-7.8 months). After a median follow-up of 23.8 months, median survival (ITT) for ET and FEC were 34 and 28 months, respectively. Nonhaematologic grade 3-4 toxicities were infrequent in both arms. Haematologic toxicity was more common with ET and febrile neutropenia was reported in 13 patients (18.6%) in the ET group. Two deaths in the ET group were possibly related to study treatment. In conclusion, both ET and FEC were associated with acceptable toxicity. ET is a highly active first-line therapy for metastatic breast cancer.",1
"5-Fluorouracil, adriamycin and cyclophosphamide combined with high-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate in advanced breast cancer.","Seventy-six patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with fluorouracil, adriamycin (doxorubicin) and cyclophosphamide (FAC) plus high-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate (HD-MPA). MPA was given for 21 days at the dose of 500 mg/day i.m., then on a randomized basis, either 500 mg/week i.m. (FAC+HD-MPA i.m.) or 300 mg/day p.o. (FAC+HD-MPA p.o.). Objective response rates were 79% in 39 patients on FAC+HD-MPA i.m. and 73% in the 37 patients on FAC+HD-MPA p.o. There was no significant difference in the median duration of response and median survival for the 2 regimens (respectively, 17 months and 22 months, and 15 months and 21 months for FAC+HD-MPA i.m. and FAC+HD-MPA p.o.). Toxicity was mild and similar in both groups. Although FAC+HD-MPA was highly effective, at present it is difficult to select which regimen provides the best initial treatment for metastatic breast cancer.",1
Randomized phase III trial of trastuzumab monotherapy followed by trastuzumab plus docetaxel versus trastuzumab plus docetaxel as first-line therapy in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer: the JO17360 Trial Group.,"We evaluated the efficacy and safety of sequential therapy with trastuzumab monotherapy (H-mono) followed by H plus docetaxel (D) after disease progression (H --> H + D) versus combination therapy with H + D as first-line therapy. Patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and left ventricular ejection fraction >50% were randomly assigned to either (a) H --> H + D [H, once weekly 2 mg/kg (loading dose, 4 mg/kg); D, once every 3 weeks 60 mg/m(2)] or (b) H + D. Primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) for the H-mono stage of the H --> H + D group and H + D group and overall survival (OS) for both groups. Secondary endpoints were overall response rate, time to treatment failure, second PFS and safety. The planned number of patients was 160 patients in total. Of 112 patients enrolled, 107 were eligible. After 112 patients were enrolled, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended stopping enrollment because PFS and OS were greater in the H + D group than the H --> H + D group. Median PFS was 445 days in the H + D group versus 114 days for H-mono in the H --> H + D group [hazard ratio (HR), 4.24; P < 0.01]. OS was significantly longer in the H + D group (HR, 2.72; P = 0.04). H + D therapy is significantly superior to H --> H + D therapy as first-line therapy in patients with HER2-positive MBC, especially in terms of OS.",1
Adriamycin versus methotrexate in five-drug combination chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer: a randomized trial.,"Adriamycin is of noteworthy efficacy in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Its role in combination regimens is under investigation. One hundred seventy-five women with advanced breast cancer were entered into a prospectively randomized trial comparing two five-drug regimens. Regimen CMFVP consisted of cyclophosphamide (C), methotrexate (M), 5-fluorouracil (F), vincristine (V), and prednisone (P). Regimen CAFVP was identical but substituted Adriamycin (A) for methotrexate. Twenty-seven patients were disqualified; 148 were evaluable. With CMFVP the complete response rate (CR) was 11%, and the partial response rate (PR) was 46%; with CAFVP, CR was 13% and PR was 45%. Duration of response tended to be slightly longer for patients on the Adriamycin arm. The median survival for CR and PR patients with CMFVP was 20.2 months, which was shorter (p = .07) than the 33 month median survival with CAFVP. Although statistical significance was not reached at the 5% level, the increased survival of responders on the Adriamycin regimen supports the data of other studies which suggest that first line combination chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer should include Adriamycin.",1
Superior survival with capecitabine plus docetaxel combination therapy in anthracycline-pretreated patients with advanced breast cancer: phase III trial results.,"PURPOSE: Docetaxel and capecitabine, a tumor-activated oral fluoropyrimidine, show high single-agent efficacy in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and synergy in preclinical studies. This international phase III trial compared efficacy and tolerability of capecitabine/docetaxel therapy with single-agent docetaxel in anthracycline-pretreated patients with MBC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized to 21-day cycles of oral capecitabine 1,250 mg/m(2) twice daily on days 1 to 14 plus docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) on day 1 (n = 255) or to docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) on day 1 (n = 256). RESULTS: Capecitabine/docetaxel resulted in significantly superior efficacy in time to disease progression (TTP) (hazard ratio, 0.652; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.545 to 0.780; P =.0001; median, 6.1 v 4.2 months), overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.775; 95% CI, 0.634 to 0.947; P =.0126; median, 14.5 v 11.5 months), and objective tumor response rate (42% v 30%, P =.006) compared with docetaxel. Gastrointestinal side effects and hand-foot syndrome were more common with combination therapy, whereas myalgia, arthralgia, and neutropenic fever/sepsis were more common with single-agent docetaxel. More grade 3 adverse events occurred with combination therapy (71% v 49%, respectively), whereas grade 4 events were slightly more common with docetaxel (31% v 25% with combination). CONCLUSION: The significantly superior TTP and survival achieved with the addition of capecitabine to docetaxel 75 mg/m(2), with the manageable toxicity profile, indicate that this combination provides clear benefits over single-agent docetaxel 100 mg/m(2). Docetaxel/capecitabine therapy is an important treatment option for women with anthracycline-pretreated MBC.",1
Tamoxifen and fluoxymesterone versus tamoxifen and danazol in metastatic breast cancer--a randomized study.,"A prospective randomized trial of tamoxifen and fluoxymesterone versus tamoxifen and danazol in metastatic breast cancer was conducted from December 1980 to September 1985. Patients were eligible regardless of site of disease, estrogen receptor status, or age. Sixty-two of sixty-three randomized patients were evaluable for response. Overall response for tamoxifen and fluoxymesterone was 11% with 61% stabilization of disease, versus 12% response rate for tamoxifen and danazol with 59% stabilization. Toxicities with tamoxifen and fluoxymesterone were greater with an increase in masculinization. We conclude that the response rates to the combinations of tamoxifen and fluoxymesterone or tamoxifen and danazol reported are equivalent in this study but that the increased toxicity with tamoxifen and fluoxymesterone would make tamoxifen and danazol the treatment of choice if a combination were to be used.",1
Randomized phase II study of FEC day 1 + 8 and FEC day 1 in patients with advanced breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Dose-intensive chemotherapy regimens without stem cell support have not resulted in an improved survival compared to standard dose regimens in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Combinations of an anthracycline, cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouracil are still standard in such patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the two different schedules of epirubicin in a standard dose FEC regimen with respect to response and toxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive a day 1 + 8 schedule (5FU and CTX 500mg/m2 day 1, epirubicin 40 mg/m2 day 1 and 8) or a day 1 schedule (5FU, CTX 500 mg/m2 and epirubicin 80 mg/m2 day 1), q day 21, both given without hematopoietic growth factors. A total of 104 eligible patients were analyzed, 52 in each arm. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A significantly higher relative dose-intensity was found for the day 1 schedule compared to the day 1 + 8 schedule. Although the trial was not set up to reliably detect a difference in response rate, this difference in relative dose-intensity in favour of the day 1 schedule does not suggest any improvement in response rate or duration of response for the day 1 schedule. Myelosuppression was severe in the day 1 + 8 schedule. We conclude that a day 1 + 8 FEC schedule has no advantage over a day 1 FEC schedule without hematopoietic growth factors in patients with metastatic breast cancer.",1
"Randomized phase II trial of infusional fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide versus infusional fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cisplatin in patients with advanced breast cancer.","PURPOSE: We previously developed an inpatient regimen that consisted of infusional fluorouracil (5-FU), epirubicin, and cisplatin (ECisF), with a response rate of 86% in advanced breast cancer. The current phase II 2:1 randomized study investigated whether cyclophosphamide can be substituted for cisplatin (ECycloF) to reduce toxicity and allow the regimen to be administered on an outpatient basis without loss of efficacy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-six women (median age, 49 years; range, 28 to 73) with breast cancer (59 metastatic, 37 locally advanced) received continuous infusional 5-FU (200 mg/m2/d via Hickman line) and six cycles of epirubicin (60 mg/m2 every 21 days) with either cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 every 21 days (38 metastatic, 24 locally advanced) or cisplatin 60 mg/m2 every 21 days (21 metastatic, 13 locally advanced). There were no significant differences in patient characteristics between these groups. RESULTS: ECycloF was better tolerated than ECisF in terms of lethargy (P = .005), stomatitis (P = .008), plantar palmar erythema (P = .02), constipation (P < .001), thrombosis (P = .0014), and nausea and vomiting (P = .05). Although there was a trend toward more anemia and leukopenia with ECisF (P =. 1), there was no significant difference in the rates of infection. Efficacy was comparable in terms of overall response (69% v 68%), complete response (CR; 13% v 15%), and median progression-free survival (9 v 8 months). CONCLUSION: ECycloF is an outpatient regimen with a lower incidence of severe nonhematologic toxicity than inpatient ECisF; it has comparable efficacy and is considerably more economical.",1
Tamoxifen plus sequential CMF chemotherapy versus tamoxifen alone in postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer: a randomized trial.,"Eighty-nine postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer, in whom estrogen receptors (ER) were positive or unknown, were treated on a controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of tamoxifen and to assess the therapeutic advantage of sequentially adding low-dose cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-5-fluorouracil (CMF) chemotherapy in tamoxifen responders. Patients with known ER negative status were not studied. After the initial 12 week treatment with tamoxifen alone, 59% of ER positive patients achieved complete or partial response as did 35% in whom ER were unknown. Response status further improved in 18% randomized to continue tamoxifen alone vs. 28% in whom CMF was added to tamoxifen. There were no statistically significant differences in time to the development of progressive disease or survival between the ER positive and ER unknown patients or between the tamoxifen and tamoxifen plus CMF groups. We conclude that inability to determine ER status should not prejudice against the use of tamoxifen in postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer. As yet, no benefit has been demonstrated from the addition of CMF chemotherapy in tamoxifen responders.",1
"CCNU, melphalan, methotrexate, and prednisone (CAMP) versus cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women.","Sixty-nine postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer were randomized to receive treatment with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) or CCNU, melphalan, methotrexate, and prednisone (CAMP). Response rate (partial and complete remission) was significantly higher with CMF (50%) than with CAMP (20%). Hematologic toxic effects were equally pronounced with the two combinations as were the other side effects with the exception of alopecia, which occurred most frequently with CMF.",1
"Low dose chemotherapy of metastatic breast cancer with cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil (CAMF) versus sequential cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil (CMF) and adriamycin.","Seventy-eight advanced breast cancer patients with hormone-resistant disease or visceral metastases were randomized to receive either of two low dose regimens consisting of cyclophosphamide (C), methotrexate (M), 5-fluorouracil (F), and Adriamycin (A) as their initial chemotherapy. One group was treated with CAMF, and the other with CMF until progression, followed by A (CMF leads to A). C was given at 50 mg/m2, po, days 1-14; M at 20 mg/m2, F at 300 mg/m2, and A at 20 mg/m2, iv, days 1 and 8 of each 28-day cycle. The response rates for CAMF vs. CMF did not differ significantly (complete and partial responses-62% vs. 49%; stabilizations-23% vs. 31%). Responses by site of metasis, median times to progression and median survivals were similar for both groups. Poor and good risk partial responders had similar survivals. Twelve percent of CMF patients treated with Adriamycin at the time of progression had partial responses with an associated improved survival. Since CMF is as effective as CAMF, but has less toxicity, low dose therapy with CMF is more acceptable than CAMF as an initial chemotherapy regimen for metastatic breast cancer. Adriamycin may be reserved for subsequent regression induction.",1
A phase III comparison of two toremifene doses to tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer. Eastern European Study Group.,"Efficacy and safety of toremifene 60 and 240 mg daily (TOR60 and TOR240) are compared to 40 mg tamoxifen daily (TAM40) in postmenopausal women with advanced estrogen receptor (ER) positive or ER unknown breast cancer. The study is randomized and open label in three parallel groups. Primary efficacy variables are response rate and time to progression. WHO and ECOG criteria were used for measurable and nonmeasurable disease assessment, respectively. Safety was reported according to WHO criteria. Altogether 463 patients were randomized (157 to TOR60, 157 to TOR240, and 149 to TAM40). By data cut-off, after 20.5 months median follow-up time, over 70% of the patients had experienced disease progression. Response rates are 20.4%, 28.7%, and 20.8% in TOR60. TOR240, and TAM40, respectively. TOR60 and TAM40 show statistically equivalent efficacy and the difference between TOR240 and TAM40 is not significant (P = 0.112). Median times to progression are 4.9 (TOR60), 6.1 (TOR240), and 5.0 (TAM40) months and the corresponding hazard ratios (TAM:TOR) 1.015 and 1.124. Again, TOR60 and TAM40 are statistically equivalent and the difference between TOR240 and TAM40 is not significant (P = 0.374). All treatments were well tolerated. As a conclusion, TOR60 and TAM40 show equivalent clinical efficacy and tolerability. The higher dose of toremifene slightly but not statistically significantly improves response rate and time to progression. In postmenopausal women, toremifene 60 mg daily is an effective and safe treatment of advanced ER-positive or ER-unknown breast cancer.",1
Phase III trial of gemcitabine plus docetaxel versus capecitabine plus docetaxel with planned crossover to the alternate single agent in metastatic breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Safety and efficacy of gemcitabine plus docetaxel (GD) and capecitabine plus docetaxel (CD) were compared in patients with metastatic breast cancer, where the alternate crossover monotherapy (GD→C or CD→G) was predetermined.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to 3-week cycles of either gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8 plus docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) on day 1 or capecitabine 1000 mg/m(2) twice daily on days 1-14 plus docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) day 1. Upon progression, patients received crossover monotherapy. Primary end point was time to progression (TtP). Secondary end points evaluated overall response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and adverse events (AEs).RESULTS: Despite over-accrual of 475 patients, the trial matured with only 324 of 385 planned TtP events due to patient discontinuations. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status was not captured in this study. More CD patients (28%) discontinued due to AEs than GD patients (18.0%, P = 0.009). TtP [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.101, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.885-1.370, P = 0.387] and OS (HR = 1.031, 95% CI 0.830-1.280, P = 0.785) were not significantly different comparing GD and CD. ORR was not statistically different (P = 0.239) comparing GD (72 of 207, 34.8%) and CD (78 of 191, 40.8%). TtP, OS, and ORR were not significantly different comparing crossover groups. GD caused greater fatigue, hepatotoxicity, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia but not febrile neutropenia; CD caused more hand-foot syndrome, gastrointestinal toxicity, and mucositis.CONCLUSIONS: GD and CD produced similar efficacy and toxicity profiles consistent with prior clinical experience.",1
Prospective randomized trial of docetaxel versus doxorubicin in patients with metastatic breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: This phase III study compared docetaxel and doxorubicin in patients with metastatic breast cancer who had received previous alkylating agent-containing chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive an intravenous infusion of docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) or doxorubicin 75 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks for a maximum of seven treatment cycles. RESULTS: A total of 326 patients were randomized, 165 to receive doxorubicin and 161 to receive docetaxel. Overall, docetaxel produced a significantly higher rate of objective response than did doxorubicin (47.8% v 33.3%; P =.008). Docetaxel was also significantly more active than doxorubicin in patients with negative prognostic factors, such as visceral metastases (objective response, 46% v 29%) and resistance to prior chemotherapy (47% v 25%). Median time to progression was longer in the docetaxel group (26 weeks v 21 weeks; difference not significant). Median overall survival was similar in the two groups (docetaxel, 15 months; doxorubicin, 14 months). There was one death due to infection in each group, and an additional four deaths due to cardiotoxicity in the doxorubicin group. Although neutropenia was similar in both groups, febrile neutropenia and severe infection occurred more frequently in the doxorubicin group. For severe nonhematologic toxicity, the incidences of cardiac toxicity, nausea, vomiting, and stomatitis were higher among patients receiving doxorubicin, whereas diarrhea, neuropathy, fluid retention, and skin and nail changes were higher among patients receiving docetaxel. CONCLUSION: The observed differences in activity and toxicity profiles provide a basis for therapy choice and confirms the rationale for combination studies in early breast cancer.",1
Randomized trial comparing conventional intravenous bolus FEC and FEC with high-dose infusional 5-fluorouracil as first-line treatment of advanced breast cancer.,"FEC (5-FU 500 mg/m2, epirubicin 50 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2) administered as a conventional bolus schedule is widely used in treatment of advanced breast cancer. 5-FU is thought to be more efficient when administered at high doses as a continuous infusion. The aim of this study was to compare the response rate, time to treatment failure, and overall survival obtained with standard FEC regimen (group A) and FEC with high-dose infusional 5-FU (750 mg/m2 per day/days 1 to 5) (group B). One hundred and seventy-eight patients entered this study, 89 in each arm; 10 were noneligible. Both groups were comparable for age, performance status, menopausal status, hormonal receptor status and prior treatment of the initial tumor, duration of relapse free interval, and type and number of disease sites. One hundred and forth patients were evaluable for efficacy. The response rate was 33.3% in group A (1.4% complete response-CR), and 39.4% in group B (9.8% CR) (ns). In an intent to treat basis (n = 168) the response rates were 26.8% and 34.1%, respectively, in groups A and B (ns). The response rate in liver metastasis was significantly higher in group B (57.1%) than in group A (20.0%) (P = 0.03). The time to treatment failure and overall survival were not different between the two groups. One hundred and fifty-three patients were evaluable for toxicity. 10.7% of the patients in group A and 16.0% in group B stopped treatment due to toxicity. Stomatitis was more frequently observed in group B than in group A (46.7% versus 2.6%, respectively, p < 10(-9)). The rates of other side effects were similar in the two groups. In conclusion, the two regimens gave similar overall response rates, time to treatment failure and survival, but infusional 5-FU yielded a better response rate in the liver metastasis.",1
"Effect of adjuvant chemotherapy with or without anthracyclines on the activity and efficacy of first-line cyclophosphamide, epidoxorubicin, and fluorouracil in patients with metastatic breast cancer.","PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of previous adjuvant chemotherapy with or without anthracyclines on overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and objective response (OR) rates of metastatic breast cancer patients treated with cyclophosphamide, epidoxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CEF) as first-line chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three-hundred twenty-six assessable metastatic breast cancer patients entered onto four consecutive randomized trials performed in our Institution and North-West Oncology Group (GONO) cooperative centers from 1983 to 1994. Patients received CEF-based chemotherapy as first-line therapy and were then evaluated. One hundred forty-four patients (44%) did not receive previous adjuvant chemotherapy, and 143 (44%) and 39 (12%) patients received cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF)-based and anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy, respectively. RESULTS: ORs to CEF chemotherapy were observed in 161 patients (49.4%). On univariate analysis, patients who had received prior adjuvant chemotherapy had a significantly lower probability of response than patients who did not: 43% versus 58% (P=.02). No difference between CMF-based (OR rate, 43%) and anthracycline-based (OR rate, 44%) adjuvant chemotherapy was observed. Stepwise logistic regression analysis indicated that adjuvant chemotherapy (P=.005), bone as dominant metastatic site (P=.02), and previous hormonotherapy for metastatic disease (P=.005) were the most important factors in predicting a poor OR rate. The median PFS and OS times of the whole group were 9.8 and 17.9 months, respectively. Patients who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy had a longer survival time (21.1 months) compared with patients previously treated with CMF-based (15.3 months) or anthracycline-based (15.8 months) adjuvant chemotherapy. Multivariate analysis confirmed adjuvant chemotherapy to be among the strongest prognostic factors associated with both a poor PFS and OS. CONCLUSION: Previous adjuvant chemotherapy adversely affects OR, PFS, and OS in metastatic breast cancer patients treated with the CEF regimen as first-line chemotherapy. No difference was observed between patients previously treated with CMF-based or anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy.",1
Toremifene and tamoxifen in advanced breast cancer--a double-blind cross-over trial.,"Toremifene (TOR) is a triphenylethylene derivative related to tamoxifen (TAM). TOR has antitumor activity, not dependent on estrogen receptors, and responses with TOR have been observed in patients with progressive disease during TAM-treatment. To elucidate possible cross-resistance between these two antiestrogens, we compared their anti-tumor activity in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. 66 postmenopausal women with advanced estrogen receptor positive or unknown breast cancer and a median age of 63 years (range 38-82) were included. Patients were randomized to TAM 40 mg/day or TOR 240 mg/day. Treatment continued until progressive disease, when cross-over to the alternative treatment was done. The response rate with first line TOR was 29% (95% confidence limits 10-41%) and with TAM 42% (95% confidence limits 25-61%). Response rates and response durations, survival and toxicity were not significantly different between the two treatments. 44 patients progressing on first line TAM or TOR were evaluable for second line TOR or TAM treatment. As no responses were observed, the possibility of over-looking a response rate of 20% or more is less than 1%. In conclusion, this study strongly indicates that TOR and TAM are clinically cross-resistant in patients with advanced breast cancer.",1
Epirubicin or epirubicin and cisplatin as first-line therapy in advanced breast cancer. A phase III study.,"PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy and toxicity of epirubicin to that of the combination of epirubicin and cisplatin in patients with advanced breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 155 patients were randomized to receive either epirubicin (70 mg/m2) days 1 and 8 every 4 weeks or epirubicin (60 mg/m2) days 1 and 8 plus cisplatin (100 mg/m2) day 1 every 4 weeks. Epirubicin was continued until disease progression or to a cumulative dose of 1000 mg/m2. Cisplatin was discontinued after six cycles. In 45 premenopausal women an oophorectomy was performed. None of the evaluable patients had received chemotherapy for metastatic disease. RESULTS: Among evaluable patients (74 in the epirubicin group and 65 in the epirubicin plus cisplatin group) there were 19% vs 29% complete responses, and 42% vs 37% partial responses, with no significant difference. In the epirubicin plus cisplatin group the response rate was significantly higher in previously untreated patients as compared with patients who had received adjuvant chemotherapy (74% vs 55%, P = 0.002). Median times to disease progression were 8.4 months in the epirubicin group and 15.3 months in the epirubicin plus cisplatin group (P = 0.045). Median survival times were 15.1 and 21.5 months, respectively (P = 0.41). In the epirubicin plus cisplatin group leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were significantly more frequent, 29% of the patients developed mild to moderate peripheral neurotoxicity, 34% reported tinnitus and hearing changes, 6 patients developed nephrotoxicity (one died due to nephrotic syndrome), and 3 patients developed leukaemia (two died of this cause). Congestive heart failure occurred in six patients in the epirubicin group and three patients in the epirubicin plus cisplatin group. CONCLUSION: Cisplatin plus epirubicin is an active, although highly toxic regimen when used as first-line therapy in advanced breast cancer. The time to disease progression was significantly longer in the cisplatin plus epirubicin group (increased by 82%). Due to toxicity, the combination regimen cannot be recommended. However, the study indicated a very high activity of cisplatin in advanced breast cancer. Studies of first-line therapy in advanced breast cancer including cisplatin or other platin derivatives in combination with, for example, the taxanes are suggested.",1
Randomized clinical trial of tamoxifen plus sequential CMF chemotherapy versus tamoxifen alone in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer.,"Eighty-eight postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer, in whom estrogen receptors (ER) were positive or unknown, were treated on a controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of tamoxifen and to assess the therapeutic advantage of sequentially adding low-dose cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-5-fluorouracil (CMF) chemotherapy in tamoxifen responders. Patients with known ER negative status were not studied. After the initial 12-week treatment with tamoxifen alone, 60% of ER positive patients achieved complete or partial response as did 35% in whom ER were unknown. Response status further improved in 18% randomized to continue tamoxifen alone vs 31% in whom CMF was added to tamoxifen. There were no statistically significant differences in time to the development of progressive disease or survival between the ER positive and ER unknown patients or between the tamoxifen and tamoxifen plus CMF groups. We conclude that inability to determine ER status should not prejudice against the use of tamoxifen in postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer. No benefit has been demonstrated from the addition of CMF chemotherapy in tamoxifen responders.",1
Randomized phase III trial comparing the new potent and selective third-generation aromatase inhibitor vorozole with megestrol acetate in postmenopausal advanced breast cancer patients. North American Vorozole Study Group.,"PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy and safety of vorozole (VOR) 2.5 mg once daily with that of megestrol acetate (MA) 40 mg four times per day as second-line therapy in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer whose disease progressed after tamoxifen treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 452 patients were enrolled onto an open, multicenter, randomized phase III trial comparing VOR to MA for tumor response, safety, and quality of life (as indicated by the Functional Living Index-Cancer score). RESULTS: Vorozole produced a response rate of 9.7%, compared with 6.8% for MA (P = .24). Clinical benefit (complete response + partial response + no change in > 6 months) was demonstrated in 23.5% and 27.2% of patients treated with VOR and MA, respectively (P = .42). Median duration of response was 18.2 months for VOR versus 12.5 months for MA (P = .074). There was no significant difference in time to progression or survival between the treatment groups. Discontinuation of treatment because of adverse events occurred less frequently in the VOR-treated group (3.1% v 6.2%; P = .18). Patients on the VOR arm reported significantly more nausea, hot flushes, arthralgia, upper respiratory tract infection, anorexia, and paresthesia, whereas those treated with MA had significantly more dyspnea, increased appetite, and weight increase. There was no difference between the two treatment groups in Functional Living Index-Cancer scores (total or subscales). However, when analyzed by objective response, patients with complete or partial responses (P = .032) or no change (P = .033) who were receiving VOR had significant improvement in the psychologic well-being subscale, compared with patients given MA. CONCLUSION: Vorozole is well tolerated and as effective as MA in the treatment of postmenopausal advanced breast cancer patients with disease progression after tamoxifen treatment.",1
"Droloxifene, a new antiestrogen, in advanced breast cancer. A double-blind dose-finding study. The Droloxifene 002 International Study Group.","To determine the optimal daily dose of the new antiestrogen droloxifene for the treatment of breast cancer, a multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, phase II trial was initiated. Postmenopausal women with progressive advanced breast cancer (distant metastatic cancer, inoperable recurrent or primary tumor) with positive or unknown hormone receptor status (estrogen or progesterone) were entered in the study. Droloxifene was administered in a double-blind randomized design with daily doses of either 20, 40, or 100 mg once daily as first-line systemic therapy. None of the patients had received previous systemic antitumor therapy with the exception of adjuvant chemotherapy terminated at least one year before the patient's recruitment. Response was determined according to Union Internationale Contre le Cancer/World Health Organization criteria. Only patients with at least one measurable lesion were entered into the trial. The highest quality of data was achieved in two ways: source verification in the hospitals through monitors and peer review with subgroups of investigators determining the tumor response of each patient at adjudication meetings (evaluating parameters obtained from physical examination and reviewing X-rays and computer tomography scans). To date, 254 patients have been enrolled. Results from all these groups, without breaking the randomization code, based on 131 patients whose data have been verified are as follows: 10 complete responses (CR), 37 partial responses (PR), 47 no change, 29 progressive disease, 8 patients too early to evaluate. Thus, the overall response rate (CR + PR) was 38%. Droloxifene was well tolerated.",1
Phase II study of hexamethylmelamine alone and in combination with mitomycin C and vincristine in advanced breast carcinoma.,"Fifty-three patients with metastatic breast carcinoma were randomized to treatment with hexamethylmelamine (HMM) as a single agent versus a three-drug reimen of HMM, vincristine, and mitomycin C (HOM). All patients had received prior treatment with 5-fluorouracil, Adriamycin, and cyclophosphamide with or without methotrexate. HMM alone was used in a dose of 300 mg/m2/day x 14 days every 21 days. In the HOM regimen, the HMM dose was 200 mg/m2/day x 21 days, the vincristine dose was 1.5 mg on Days 1, 8, and 15, and the mitomycin C dose was 12 mg/m2 once every 6 weeks. No objective responses were observed with HMM in 15 evaluable patients. The HOM regimen resulted in five partial responses among the 27 evaluable patients. Gastrointestinal toxicity was the limiting toxicity of HMM, and thrombocytopenia was the major toxicity of the HOM regimen.",1
Weekly docetaxel with or without gemcitabine as second-line chemotherapy in paclitaxel-pretreated patients with metastatic breast cancer: a randomized phase II study conducted by the Hellenic Co-Operative Oncology Group.,"OBJECTIVE: A randomized phase II trial was conducted to test whether the addition of gemcitabine to weekly docetaxel could improve the objective response rate and survival outcomes as second-line chemotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer who have failed a paclitaxel-containing regimen. METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive either weekly docetaxel 40 mg/m(2) (group A, n = 34) or the combination of weekly docetaxel 35 mg/m(2) with gemcitabine 600 mg/m(2) (group B, n = 41). Three consecutive weekly infusions followed by a 1-week rest period represented 1 chemotherapy cycle. RESULTS: The objective response rate was 18% and 27.5% in group A and B, respectively (p = 0.413). No statistically significant differences were demonstrated in terms of median overall survival and time to disease progression. The rate and grade 3 and 4 neutropenia were higher in group B (23 vs. 3%). CONCLUSIONS: The weekly administration of docetaxel and gemcitabine did not result in superior clinical outcomes over weekly docetaxel.",1
Cyclophosphamide and nandrolone decanoate in the treatment of advanced carcinoma of the breast--results of a comparative controlled trial of the agents used singly and in combination.,"A random trial in which cyclophosphamide, nandrolone decanoate and the two drugs in combination were used in the treatment of advanced breast carcinoma is described. The results suggest that it is preferable to use cyclophosphamide on its own.",1
Ifosfamide versus cyclophosphamide in combination drug therapy for metastatic breast cancer.,"A combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), adriamycin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) was compared to a combination of 5-FU, adriamycin, and ifosfamide (FAI) in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. All patients in the FAC and FAI groups also received nonspecific immunotherapy with bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and levamisole. Of 117 evaluable FAC patients, 19 (16%) achieved complete remission and 66 (56%) achieved partial remission. In the FAI group, eight of 49 (16%) evaluable patients achieved complete remission and 24 (50%) achieved partial remission. The response rates, durations of remission, and survival were similar in both groups. The combination of two immunotherapeutic agents (BCG and levamisole) did not have an additive effect since their results were similar to our previous experience with FAC-BCG and FAC-levamisole. In the FAI group, 25% of the patients had hematuria, while none of the patients in the FAC group had urinary complications. Nausea and vomiting were more severe in FAI-treated patients and some patients required iv fluids to correct dehydration. Ifosfamide in combination with 5-FU and adriamycin was more toxic than and not superior to cyclophosphamide.",1
Cyclic combination chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer: comparison of two CMF schedules.,"104 nonrandomized patients suffering from metastatic breast cancer were treated with monthly cycles of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF). One group (group A, 44 patients) received low-dose CMF and another one (group B, 60 patients) received standard doses. In both cases, therapy was cycled every 29 days. Group A patients had a response rate of 50.7%, including 5 complete remissions. The median duration of response was 8.2 months. For group B patients, the response rate was of 68.1%, including 10 complete remissions. The median duration of response was 10.6 months. Toxicity was greater in group B patients, the main side effects being nausea, vomiting, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, alopecia and stomatitis.",1
FEC (5-fluorouracil-epirubicin-cyclophosphamide) monthly versus FEC weekly in metastatic breast cancer. First results of a randomized trial.,"Patients (n = 174) with metastatic breast cancer previously untreated with anthracycline cytotoxic agents were randomized into two groups: Group 1 received FEC (5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m2, epirubicin 60 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2) once every fourth week and group 2 received the treatment once weekly in the same monthly dosage. Treatment was recommended to continue until disease progression or to a cumulative epirubicin dose of 1,000 mg/m2, but could be discontinued at any time at the patient's request or at the treating physician's judgement. An interim analysis was made when 131 patients were evaluable for response, and 128 patients for toxicity. Hematological toxicity was significantly more severe in the monthly group, as was nausea and vomiting. Of the monthly treated patients 76% had total alopecia compared to 14% in the weekly group. There were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of mucositis. Monthly FEC gave significantly higher response rate than weekly treatment (52 vs 34%, p = 0.01). Time to progression was significantly (p = 0.004) longer with monthly FEC. Patients in the monthly treated group lived significantly (p = 0.02) longer than patients in the weekly group. These results indicate that both toxicity and efficacy of epirubicin-containing combination therapy in breast cancer is dependent on the treatment schedule, not merely on dosage. Both efficacy and toxicity increased when the treatment was given once monthly compared to the weekly schedule.",1
Randomised phase II trial of gemcitabine plus vinorelbine vs gemcitabine plus cisplatin vs gemcitabine plus capecitabine in patients with pretreated metastatic breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: An increasing proportion of patients are exposed to anthracyclines and/or taxanes in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting. Re-exposure in the metastatic stage is limited by drug resistance, thus evaluation of non-cross-resistant regimens is mandatory.METHODS: Anthracycline-pretreated patients were randomly assigned to three gemcitabine-based regimens. Chemotherapy consisted of gemcitabine 1.000 mg m(-2) plus vinorelbin 25 mg m(-2) on days 1+8 (GemVin), or plus cisplatin 30 mg m(-2) on days 1+8 (GemCis), or plus capecitabine 650 mg m(-2) b.i.d. orally days 1-14 (GemCap), q3w. The primary end point was response rate.RESULTS: A total of 141 patients were recruited on the trial. The overall response rates were 39.0% (GemVin), 47.7% (GemCis) and 34.7% (GemCap). Median progression-free survival was estimated with 5.7, 6.9 and 8.3 months, respectively. Corresponding median survival times were 17.5 (GemVin), 13.0 (GemCis) and 19.4 months (GemCap). Neutropenia ≥grade 3 occurred in 16.7% (Gem/Vin), 4.4% (GemCis) and 0% (Gem/Cap), whereas non-haematological toxicities were rarely severe except grade 3 hand-foot syndrome in 2.0% of the GemCap patients (per patient analysis).CONCLUSIONS: This randomised phase II trial has revealed comparable results for three gemcitabine-based regimens regarding treatment efficacy and toxicity. Gemcitabine-based chemotherapy appears to be a worthwhile treatment option for pretreated patients with metastatic breast cancer.",1
"Combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, fluorouracil, and either epirubicin or mitoxantrone: a comparative randomized multicenter study in metastatic breast carcinoma.","From February 1987 to January 1989, 60 patients with advanced breast cancer and no prior chemotherapy for advanced disease were randomized and studied, with 31 treated with fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC) and 29 patients with fluorouracil, mitoxantrone, and cyclophosphamide (FNC). Doses were 500 mg/m2 fluorouracil, 500 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide, and 50 mg/m2 epirubicin2 or 10 mg/m mitoxantrone, i.v. Day 1 every 3 weeks. There were no statistically significant differences in pretreatment patient characteristics between the groups. Fifty-six patients were evaluable for response (29 in the FEC arm and 27 in the FNC arm). The response rates were 48.2% for the FEC group (complete response (CR) 10.3% and partial response (PR) 37.9%) and 40.7% for the FNC group (CR 3.7% and PR 37%) (not significantly different, NS). The median response duration was 247 and 267 days, respectively (NS), the median time to progression and time to treatment failure was 244 and 155.5 days for the FEC group and 86 and 98 days for the FNC group, respectively (NS). The incidence of nausea/vomiting was 87.1% in the FEC group and 79.3% in the FNC group, with comparable severity. Alopecia occurred in 80.6% of FEC patients and 44.8% of FNC patients (p less than 0.05). The incidences and degrees of severity of leukopenia, anemia, and cardiotoxicity were comparable in the two treatment groups. Efficacy and toxicity of the two regimens were quite similar. FNC can improve the quality of life of patients by providing significantly less alopecia.",1
Gemcitabine plus Paclitaxel versus Paclitaxel monotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer and prior anthracycline treatment.,"PURPOSE: The objective of this phase III global study was to compare the efficacy of gemcitabine plus paclitaxel (GT) versus paclitaxel in patients with advanced breast cancer. It was designed as a pivotal study for the approval of G for a breast cancer treatment indication. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients who relapsed after adjuvant anthracyclines were randomly assigned to gemcitabine,1,250 mg/m(2) days 1 and 8 plus paclitaxel, 175 mg/m(2) on day 1; or, to paclitaxel at same dose on day 1 (both arms administered every 21 days, unblinded). The primary end point was overall survival (OS) and secondary end points were time to progression (TTP), response rate (RR), progression-free survival, response duration, and toxicity. This final OS analysis was planned at 380 deaths. RESULTS: A total of 266 patients were randomly assigned to GT and 263 to paclitaxel. Median survival on GT was 18.6 months versus 15.8 months on paclitaxel (log-rank P = . 0489), with an adjusted Cox hazard ratio of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.64 to 0.96; P = .0187). The TTP was longer (6.14 v 3.98 months; log-rank P = .0002) and the RR was better (41.4% v 26.2%; P = .0002) on GT. There was more grade 3 to 4 neutropenia on GT and grade 2 to 4 fatigue and neuropathy were slightly more prevalent on GT. CONCLUSION: This phase III study documents a role for gemcitabine in advanced breast cancer after anthracycline-based adjuvant therapy. The results establish GT as a reasonable choice for women who require cytoreduction with manageable toxicities and validate ongoing testing of GT in the adjuvant setting.",1
A randomized phase 2 trial comparing 3-hour versus 96-hour infusion schedules of paclitaxel for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: This study was performed to compare efficacy and toxicity profiles of paclitaxel using 3-hour versus 96-hour infusion schedules. METHODS: Patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) were randomly assigned to receive paclitaxel starting at a dose of 250 mg/m(2) intravenously (iv) over 3 hours every 21 days or paclitaxel starting at a dose of 140 mg/m(2) iv over 96 hours every 21 days. Stratification variables included number of prior chemotherapy regimens and previous response to anthracyclines. Response was assessed every 2 cycles using bidimensional measurements. Patients were allowed to cross over at disease progression or therapy intolerance. RESULTS: A total of 214 patients received therapy (107 patients per arm). Response rates were similar: 23.4% in the 3-hour arm and 29.9% in the 96-hour arm (P = .28). The median duration of response (8.9 months vs 5.7 months; P = .75) and progression-free survival (5.0 months vs 3.8 months; P = .17) slightly favored the 96-hour arm. Overall survival was slightly longer in the 3-hour arm (14.2 months vs 12.7 months; P = .57). One patient who crossed over to the 96-hour arm (N = 18) developed a partial response; no response was noted with crossover to the 3-hour arm (N = 10). Myalgia/arthralgia and neuropathy were more frequent in the 3-hour arm, whereas mucositis, neutropenic fever/infection, and diarrhea were more common in the 96-hour arm. CONCLUSIONS: Paclitaxel given by 3-hour or 96-hour infusion was active in MBC. The 96-hour paclitaxel regimen did not significantly improve response or time to disease progression, was more cumbersome to administer, and was associated with greater myelosuppression (but less neuropathy and myalgia) compared with the 3-hour schedule.",1
Phase III study of gemcitabine plus docetaxel compared with capecitabine plus docetaxel for anthracycline-pretreated patients with metastatic breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: Patients with metastatic breast cancer who are pretreated with anthracyclines frequently receive taxane-based combinations. This phase III study compared the efficacy and safety of gemcitabine-docetaxel (GD) with capecitabine-docetaxel (CD) in advanced breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to GD (G 1,000 mg/m(2) days 1 and 8; D 75 mg/m(2) day 1) or CD (C 1,250 mg/m(2) twice daily days 1 through 14; D 75 mg/m(2) day 1) every 21 days. Comparison of progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary objective. RESULTS: Patient characteristics were balanced between arms (N = 305). Median PFS was 8.05 months (95% CI, 6.60 to 8.71) for GD and 7.98 (95% CI, 6.93 to 8.77) for CD (log-rank P = .121). Overall response rate (ORR) was 32% in both arms, and overall survival (OS) was not different between arms (P = .983). Time to treatment failure (TTF; defined as discontinuation, progressive disease, death as a result of any cause, or the start of a new anticancer therapy) was superior in the GD arm (P = .059). Hematologic toxicity was similar in both arms, except for grades 3 to 4 leukopenia (GD, 78%; CD, 66%; P = .025) and transfusions (GD, 17%; CD, 7%; P = .0051). Grades 3 to 4 diarrhea, mucositis, and hand-and-foot syndrome were significantly higher in the CD arm. Fewer patients in the GD arm discontinued because of drug-related adverse events (13% v 27% in CD; P = .002). CONCLUSION: No difference was observed between GD and CD arms in PFS, ORR, and OS. TTF was longer in the GD arm. These findings, combined with a nonhematologic toxicity profile that favors GD over approved doses of CD, suggest that gemcitabine may be a better option than capecitabine in combination with docetaxel in this clinical setting.",1
Chemoimmunotherapy of advanced breast cancer: prolongation of remission and survival with BCG.,"Forty-five patients with disseminated breast cancer were given a trial of combination chemotherapy consisting of fluorouracil, adriamycin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) and immunotherapy with BCG given by scarification. The results were compared with those in a comparable group of 44 patients treated with FAC alone immediately before the chemoimmunotherapy study. The remission rates (73% and 76% for FAC and FAC-BCG respectively) were similar in both studies. The durations of remission for patients on FAC-BCG (medium 12 months) were longer than remissions achieved for patients given FAC alone (median 8 months) (P = 0.068). The most notable effect of BCG was on survival. Thus 21 out of 34 patients achieving remission on FAC-BCG were alive at the time of the last follow-up examination (median over 22 months) compared with 11 out of 32 patients achieving remission on FAC (median 15 months) (P = 0.01). Twenty-six of the 45 patients given FAC-BCG were alive at the time of the last follow-up examination (median over 22 months) compared with 12 of the 44 patients given FAC (median 15 months) (P = 0.005). Although the apparent benefit of BCG could be explained by a maldistribution of some prognostic factors, the data suggest that further trial of chemoimmunotherapy of breast cancer should be carried out.",1
Randomised study of anastrozole versus tamoxifen as first-line therapy for advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women.,"A total of 668 patients (340 anastrozole and 328 tamoxifen) were randomised in a double-blind, double-dummy multicentre study. Anastrozole was given in a dose of 1 mg once daily and compared with tamoxifen 20 mg daily in postmenopausal patients with tumours that were hormone-receptor positive or of unknown receptor status. The efficacy and tolerability of anastrozole was compared with that of tamoxifen as first-line therapy for advanced breast cancer. The median time to progression was similar for both treatments (8.2 months in anastrozole patients and 8.3 months in tamoxifen patients). Anastrozole was also as effective as tamoxifen in terms of objective response-rate with 33% in the anastrozole group and 32.6% in the tamoxifen group achieving a complete or partial response. Both treatments were well tolerated. However, incidences of thromboembolic events and vaginal bleeding were reported in fewer patients treated with anastrozole than with tamoxifen. In conclusion, these findings indicate that anastrozole can be considered as first-line therapy for postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer.",1
The addition of paclitaxel to continuous infusion 5-fluorouracil is an active regimen for metastatic breast cancer.,"Metastatic breast cancer is commonly thought to be incurable. Treatment advances have resulted in increased response rates, although such responses are often more palliative than curative. A regimen of continuous infusion 5-fluorouracil (5FU) or continuous infusion 5-fluorouracil with paclitaxel was studied in patients with metastatic breast cancer and measurable disease. The induction therapy preceded high-dose ifosfamide, carboplatin, and melphalan in a phase I-II trial. Eighty-seven patients were enrolled in the trial. Forty-five received continuous infusion 5-fluorouracil as induction and 42 received 5-fluorouracil and paclitaxel. The single-agent, continuous infusion 5-fluorouracil cohort had one complete response (2%) and eight partial responses (18%). The combination continuous infusion 5-fluorouracil and 3-hour paclitaxel regimen produced four complete responses (10%) and 17 partial responses (40%). The combination regimen of continuous infusion 5-fluorouracil with bolus paclitaxel was well tolerated and with a 50% response rate, is an active regimen for women with metastatic breast cancer.",1
"Doxorubicin vs epirubicin, report of a second-line randomized phase II/III study in advanced breast cancer. EORTC Breast Cancer Cooperative Group.","The EORTC Breast Cancer Cooperative Group carried out a randomized trial to compare doxorubicin with epirubicin as second-line chemotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Two hundred and fifty-nine patients with at least one site of metastatic disease entered this trial, of whom 232 patients were eligible. Treatment consisted of doxorubicin 75 mg m(-2) or epirubicin 90 mg m(-2) i.v. every 3 weeks. The overall response rates for doxorubicin and epirubicin were 36% and 28% respectively (P = 0.173). The median time to progression was 23 weeks for doxorubicin and 19 weeks for epirubicin (P = 0.063) and the median duration of response was 40 weeks for doxorubicin and 32 weeks for epirubicin (P = 0.059). The median survival was 47 weeks for doxorubicin and 44 weeks for epirubicin (P = 0.196). Leucocyte count on retreatment day (P = 0.011) and platelet nadir (P = 0.031) were significantly lower in the doxorubicin-treated group. Also mucositis (P < 0.001), diarrhoea (P = 0.005) and haemorrhage (P = 0.048) were significantly worse in the doxorubicin arm. Nine patients on doxorubicin and two patients on epirubicin experienced congestive heart failure (CHF). At the dose levels used in this study, no statistical differences in response rate and survival were found between the two treatment arms. Treatment with doxorubicin tended to result in a slightly longer duration of response and time to progression but doxorubicin was more toxic than epirubicin.",1
"Droloxifene, a new anti-oestrogen in postmenopausal advanced breast cancer: preliminary results of a double-blind dose-finding phase II trial.","Droloxifene (3-OH-tamoxifen citrate) is a novel anti-oestrogen with a higher affinity for oestrogen receptors (ER), a lower oestrogenic to anti-oestrogenic activity ratio and faster pharmacokinetics compared with tamoxifen. From May 1988 to April 1991, 369 postmenopausal women with metastatic or locally unresectable breast cancer of which the ER or progesterone receptor status was positive or unknown, were randomised to receive an oral dose of 20, 40 or 100 mg droloxifene once daily. 43 Brazilian, Canadian and European centres took part in this double-blind phase II trial. 60 women were ineligible for violation of entry criteria; 20 were inevaluable and 15 still await definitive response evaluation. 234 patients have been evaluated for response. The over-all objective response rate (complete plus partial) was 92/234 (39.3%): 23/74 (31.1%) for 20 mg, 33/74 (44.6%) for 40 mg and 36/86 (41.9%) for 100 mg (not significantly different within this dose range). There was no significant difference in time to tumour progression between the three doses. Toxicity was minimal at all doses. These preliminary results show that droloxifene is active against advanced breast cancer. Because of its outstanding preclinical characteristics, the drug warrants large-scale clinical investigation.",1
Appraising cardiotoxicity associated with liposomal doxorubicin by means of tissue Doppler echocardiography end-points: rationale and design of the LITE (Liposomal doxorubicin-Investigational chemotherapy-Tissue Doppler imaging Evaluation) randomized pilot study.,"BACKGROUND: Cardiomyopathy following anthracycline chemotherapy may have ominous clinical implications in cancer patients treated with this effective yet potentially toxic therapy. Early detection at subclinical stage is pivotal to minimize the risk of overt cardiotoxicity. Liposomal anthracyclines have the potential for more selective uptake by cancer cells and reduced cardiac toxicity. OBJECTIVE: We designed a single-center randomized clinical trial, the Liposomal doxorubicin-Investigational chemotherapy-Tissue Doppler imaging Evaluation (LITE) pilot study to compare the safety of liposomal doxorubicin vs standard epirubicin in terms of clinical and subclinical cardiotoxicity. METHODS: Whereas diagnostic and prognostic instruments effective at early recognition of cardiomyopathy are lacking, promising data have been reported for tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) echocardiography. The study will enroll 80 patients with breast cancer and indication to anthracycline chemotherapy, randomizing them in a 1:1 ratio to liposomal doxorubicin or standard epirubicin. The primary end-point will be the comparison of changes from baseline to 12-month follow-up of left ventricular TDI systolic function parameters, and the co-primary end-point will be based instead on changes in TDI diastolic function parameters. Among secondary end-points, we will adjudicate changes in standard 2-dimensional echocardiography parameters, including ejection fraction, peak values of biochemical markers of cardiac damage and heart failure, ie cardiac troponin T and BNP, overall survival, functional class, freedom from cancer recurrence, and adverse effects of chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the LITE pilot study should provide important clinical and mechanistic insights on the promising role of liposomal anthracyclines in patients with breast cancer and indication to anthracycline chemotherapy (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00531973).",0

Megestrol acetate v tamoxifen in advanced breast cancer: a phase III trial of the Piedmont Oncology Association (POA).,"One hundred twenty-four patients with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive megestrol acetate 40 mg orally, four times daily, or tamoxifen 10 mg orally twice daily. If therapy failed patients were crossed over to the alternate treatment. Eligibility required that either the estrogen or progesterone receptor be positive or that both values be unknown, and that patients be at least 2 years postspontaneous menopause or over 50 years of age. Pretreatment characteristics were similar for both groups. Three patients had had previous hormonal therapy while one third had had chemotherapy. Objective response for evaluable patients based on strict UICC criteria was 29% with megestrol acetate and 31% with tamoxifen. Responses in patients with bone and soft tissue disease were similar for both regimens; however, 7 of 19 (37%) patients with visceral disease responded to tamoxifen but none of 18 (0%) responded to megestrol acetate. Response did not correlate with amount of estrogen or progesterone receptor. Unadjusted analysis of time to progression and survival showed no significant differences between regimens. With adjustment for pretreatment characteristics, patients on tamoxifen had a statistically significant prolongation of both of these parameters. Crossover data show 3 of 24 patients responding to tamoxifen after failure on megestrol acetate and 1 of 24 responding to megestrol acetate after failure on tamoxifen. However, crossover data should be viewed cautiously, as patients who are currently responding to initial treatment are those who would be most likely to respond to crossover therapy.",1
Sequential versus alternating regimens in the treatment of advanced breast cancer. Argentine Breast Cancer Cooperative Group.,"With the object of proving whether sequential or alternate forms of chemotherapy would be advantageous one over the other in treating advanced breast cancer and with the purpose of evaluating two different anthracyclines at equimolecular doses in the above-mentioned alternating regimens, 250 patients who had received no prior chemo- or hormonotherapy were entered in a prospective randomized trial. Group A was administered 4-epiadriamycin and cyclophosphamide for 8 courses, followed by 6 cycles of CMF, and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) from the beginning of therapy until progression. In group B, adriamycin + cyclophosphamide were alternated with CMF every two courses until 14 cycles were completed. Group C received 4'-epiadriamycin + cyclophosphamide alternated with CMF for 14 courses. In groups B and C, MPA was administered as in group A. Two hundred and twenty-four patients were evaluated. CR + PR were observed in 55.8% of group A, 43.4% of group B, and 46.4% of group C. Median duration of responses was 16 months (m) in group A, 13 m in group B and 20 m in group C, and median survival (CR + PR) was 16.5 m in group A, 16 m in group B and 24 m in group C. There were no statistically significant differences among the three groups in terms of response rate, duration of response and survival; furthermore, toxicity was moderate in all groups. At equimolecular doses there were no differences between adriamycin and epirubicin in the alternating schedules.",1
Treatment and survival on advanced breast cancer.,"The final results of a clinical trial comparing endocrine with cytotoxic drug treatment for advanced breast cancer were analysed. Although cytotoxic treatment gave a significantly higher response rate with a remission duration comparable to that obtained with endocrine treatment, the sequence in which the two treatments were given did not appear to influence survival--except possibly in women with rapidly progressing disease, when cytotoxic treatment is preferred.",0
Phase III randomized trial of sunitinib versus capecitabine in patients with previously treated HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.,"This multicenter, randomized, open-label phase III trial (planned enrollment: 700 patients) was conducted to test the hypothesis that single-agent sunitinib improves progression-free survival (PFS) compared with capecitabine as treatment for advanced breast cancer (ABC). Patients with HER2-negative ABC that recurred after anthracycline and taxane therapy were randomized (1:1) to sunitinib 37.5 mg/day or capecitabine 1,250 mg/m(2) (1,000 mg/m(2) in patients >65 years) BID on days 1-14 q3w. The independent data-monitoring committee (DMC) determined during the first interim analysis (238 patients randomized to sunitinib, 244 to capecitabine) that the trial be terminated due to futility in reaching the primary endpoint. No statistical evidence supported the hypothesis that sunitinib improved PFS compared with capecitabine (one-sided P = 0.999). The data indicated that PFS was shorter with sunitinib than capecitabine (median 2.8 vs. 4.2 months, respectively; HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.16-1.87; two-sided P = 0.002). Median overall survival (15.3 vs. 24.6 months; HR, 1.17; two-sided P = 0.350) and objective response rates (11 vs. 16%; odds ratio, 0.65; P = 0.109) were numerically inferior with sunitinib versus capecitabine. While no new or unexpected safety findings were reported, sunitinib treatment was associated with higher frequencies and greater severities of many common adverse events (AEs) compared with capecitabine, resulting in more temporary discontinuations due to AEs with sunitinib (66 vs. 51%). The relative dose intensity was lower with sunitinib than capecitabine (73 vs. 95%). Based on these efficacy and safety results, sunitinib should not be used as monotherapy for patients with ABC.",1
Tamoxifen alone versus tamoxifen plus 1-(2-tetrahydrofuryl)-5-fluorouracil in the treatment of advanced breast cancer: a sequential trial.,"During the past 4 years, a sequential study was conducted to compare the effect of tamoxifen (TAM) alone and TAM plus 1-(2-tetrahydrofuryl)-5-fluorouracil (FT) in the treatment of advanced breast cancer. The overall response rates were 28.9% in 45 patients treated with TAM, and 43.2% in 37 treated with TAM + FT. In regard to dominant site of lesions, 4 out of 9 patients (44.4%) with visceral involvement responded to TAM + FT, whereas none out of 10 responded to TAM alone. In a crossover study, 4 out of 5 failures to TAM responded favorably to TAM + FT. The median value of survival was 24 months in patients treated with TAM alone and 36 months with TAM + FT. Side effects such as gastrointestinal disorders and bone marrow suppression slightly increased in incidence when cytotoxic chemotherapy was combined with TAM. The present chemo-endocrine regimen with TAM + FT showed some advantages over TAM alone.",1
Adjuvant chemo(immuno-)-therapy of primary breast cancer with adriamycin-cyclophosphamide (and levamisole)--six-year evaluation.,In a phase II-type study 52 patients with no signs of metastases but with a high risk of recurrence were treated with 6 courses of adriamycin-cyclophosphamide as adjuvant systemic therapy following modified radical mastectomy of primary breast cancer. Half of the patients were randomized to receive additional immunotherapy with levamisole for 2 yr. The scheduled dose and time regimen could be achieved in over 90% of patients. A comparison of the actuarial disease-free and overall survival with data reported in the literature indicates a similar positive effect of adjuvant systemic therapy as described in adjuvant studies using polychemotherapy regimens. Immunotherapy with levamisole has no effect on disease-free and overall survival but added to general toxicity. Particular attention was paid to psychological consequences of adjuvant systemic therapy; consistent attention by one specifically trained physician during the whole therapy and follow-up period was effective in coping with the emotional problems. The difficulties in treating recurrences after adjuvant therapy became apparent. A high rate of loco-regional recurrences and of cerebral metastases was noted.,0
A study of the effects of the aromatase inhibitors anastrozole and letrozole on bone metabolism in postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.,"ALIQUOT (Anastrozole vs. Letrozole, an Investigation of Quality Of Life and Tolerability) was a prospective, open-label, randomized pharmacodynamic study designed to assess the effects of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) on bone turnover in healthy postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Ninety-four patients were randomized to receive either 12 weeks of letrozole (2.5 mg; n = 42) followed by 12 weeks of anastrozole (1 mg), or 12 weeks of anastrozole (1 mg; n = 42) followed by 12 weeks of letrozole (2.5 mg). After completion of the study period, patients in the immediate adjuvant group were either switched to tamoxifen (n = 38) or continued on anastrozole or letrozole. In the beginning of the study, 42 patients had taken tamoxifen within 3 months. Patients taking drugs likely to affect bone metabolism, including bisphosphonates, were excluded. Eighty-four patients had complete sample measurements and were included in the analysis. Prior tamoxifen therapy resulted in a significantly lower mean baseline procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (PINP) compared with patients with no prior tamoxifen. There were no significant differences in bone markers between AIs at any time. By 6 months, significant increases were seen in PINP, C-terminal telopeptides (CTX), bone specific alkaline phosphatise (ALP), and urinary N-terminal telopeptides (NTX). Patients with prior tamoxifen had significantly greater increases than patients with no prior tamoxifen. Patients treated with 3 months of tamoxifen following 6 months of an AI showed a significant decrease in markers of bone resorption, serum CTX and urinary NTX. In conclusion, AI-induced bone turnover increases over time. Anastrozole and letrozole produce similar effects on bone metabolism and turnover. Stopping tamoxifen therapy and starting AIs results in a significantly greater increase in bone turnover compared with commencing AIs in tamoxifen-naïve patients. Patients given tamoxifen following AI therapy showed a decrease in markers of bone resorption.",0
Influence of menopausal status on sleep and hot flashes throughout breast cancer adjuvant chemotherapy.,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the patterns and differences among sleep and hot flashes based on menopausal status (pre, peri, or post) in breast cancer adjuvant chemotherapy patients before, during, and after treatment. DESIGN: Secondary analysis from a randomized clinical trial. SETTING: Outpatient clinics and participants' homes. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred nineteen (219) women; mean age of 52 years (29-79); postoperative, Stages I to IIIA breast cancer. METHODS: Participants were randomized to a behavioral sleep intervention or a healthy eating control group. Variables measured were menopausal status (self-report), subjective sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), objective sleep (actigraphy), perceived interruption of sleep by hot flashes (diary), and demographic/medical characteristics. Data reported were collected 48 hours before initial chemotherapy, at treatment 4, and 30 days after the last treatment. Analysis included descriptives and repeated measures mixed model analysis of variance. RESULTS: Objective sleep and the perceived interruption of sleep by hot flashes changed significantly over time. Sleep and hot flashes differed over time by menopausal status. Only hot flashes were significantly different by study group and by menopausal status over time. CONCLUSION: Women's menopausal status when starting chemotherapy was associated with differing patterns of sleep and hot flashes over time.",0

Independent review of E2100: a phase III trial of bevacizumab plus paclitaxel versus paclitaxel in women with metastatic breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: E2100, an open-label, randomized, phase III trial conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), demonstrated a significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR) with paclitaxel plus bevacizumab compared with paclitaxel alone as initial chemotherapy for patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. METHODS: An independent, blinded review of radiologic and clinical data was performed, assessing progression and response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. In addition, ECOG's investigator assessments were reanalyzed using the same methods applied to the independent review. The primary end point was PFS as assessed by an independent review facility (IRF). RESULTS: The addition of bevacizumab to paclitaxel resulted in a statistically significant improvement in PFS using both the IRF and investigator assessments. Hazard ratios for PFS (0.48, 95% CI, 0.385 to 0.607; P < .0001 for the IRF v 0.42, 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.52; P < .0001 for ECOG investigators) and the improvement in median PFS (11.3 v 5.8 months for the IRF v 11.4 v 5.8 months for ECOG investigators) were similar. Among patients with measurable disease at baseline, the IRF-assessed ORR was significantly higher in patients treated with paclitaxel and bevacizumab (48.9% v 22.2%; P < .0001). CONCLUSION: The risk of progression was reduced by more than half and the ORR more than doubled with the addition of bevacizumab to weekly paclitaxel in both analyses, confirming a substantial and robust bevacizumab treatment effect. The consistency between the IRF and ECOG analyses validates the original data previously reported by ECOG in this open-label trial.",0
High-dose etoposide in treatment of metastatic breast cancer.,"High-dose etoposide (1,500-2,500 mg/m2) was used for the treatment of 23 previously treated patients with advanced breast cancer. Six of 23 (26%) showed objective regression with a median duration of response of 5 months. Responses were seen at all sites apart from bone. Response was related to dose level with 11/23 responses of measurable lesions occurring at doses greater than or equal to 2,000 mg/m2 as compared to 2/23 responses at a dose of 1,500 mg/m2. The treatment regimen was able to be given on an outpatient basis with only routine supportive measures. High-dose etoposide may come to play a role in high-dose combination chemotherapy regimens for advanced breast cancer.",1
Clinical recognition and management of depression in node negative breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen.,"Depression is not an uncommon complaint of women with breast cancer and is usually assumed to be related to the cancer diagnosis itself or its treatment. As part of a prospective clinical trial of adjuvant therapy of node negative breast cancer, 301 patients treated and assessed by one oncologist (SEJ) were serially questioned for symptoms of depression in the first 6-12 months after completing initial treatment (surgery, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy). Two hundred and fifty-seven patients were evaluable for assessment of depression; 155 were receiving tamoxifen and 102 were not. Twenty-six patients had symptoms of depression including 23 (15%) treated with tamoxifen compared to 3 (3%) in the group not placed on tamoxifen (p < 0.005). Of the 23 patients with depression in the tamoxifen group, symptoms were temporally related to the initiation of therapy and occurred generally in the first 2 months of treatment. Eight patients had mild symptoms not requiring a dose reduction, 8 had significant depression requiring a dose reduction to relieve symptoms, and 7 required discontinuation of tamoxifen. We conclude that clinical depression as a side effect of tamoxifen therapy may be more common than previously believed and should be further rigorously investigated to confirm or deny our clinical impressions.",0
"Comparison of 5-day, 1-day, and 2-day cyclical combination chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer.","The results of 5-day cyclical combined chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer were compared in two trials with the less demanding 1-day and 2-day regimens. At all stages, except at 3 months, 5-day treatment was significantly more successful in providing regression and remission of tumours than the 1-day regimen. However, although the differences are not statistically significant, data from the second trial indicated that the 2-day regimen tended to be more effective than the 5-day regimen. The lower 95% confidence limit for the success of the 2-day treatment was 56.2% at 3 months.",0
Phase I clinical and pharmacokinetics study of high-dose toremifene in postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer.,"Toremifene is an antiestrogen that binds strongly to estrogen receptors (ER). A total of 19 previously treated postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer whose performance status was good and whose ER status was positive or unknown were studied to determine the maximum tolerated dose of toremifene. Cohorts of patients received 200, 300, or 400 mg/m2 p.o. daily until relapse or unacceptable toxicity had occurred. Nausea, vomiting, and dizziness were dose-related. Three of five patients receiving 400 mg/m2 experienced moderate or severe vomiting and another developed reversible disorientation and hallucinations. Mild sweating, peripheral edema, vaginal discharge, and hot flushes were encountered at all doses. Reversible corneal pigmentation was identified in seven cases but was not of clinical importance. The pharmacokinetics of toremifene was studied weekly and in detail on day 42 using a high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) assay that identified the parent compound and three active metabolites, N-desmethyltoremifene, (deaminohydroxy)toremifene, and didemethyltoremifene. Steady state was achieved at 1-3 weeks. The toremifene area under the curve and the maximal concentration were dose-dependent at high doses. The recommended phase II dose is 300 mg/m2 p.o. daily.",1

Acute cardiac toxicity in patients after doxorubicin treatment and the effect of combined tocopherol and nifedipine pretreatment.,"In two groups of female patients with metastatic breast cancer who had all been pretreated with doxorubicin (350 mg/m2), acute cardiac effects following i.v. doxorubicin bolus injection (60 mg/m2) were recorded on the basis of systolic time intervals (STI). In six patients who received doxorubicin only the ratio between the heart-beat-corrected preejection period and left ventricular ejection time (PEPI:LVETI) as well as the PEP index were found to be significantly increased with a peak at 6 h following drug infusion (P less than 0.001). Another six patients received an identical chemotherapeutic regimen and, in addition, a combination of tocopherol (200 mg i.m. 6 h before treatment) and nifedipine (60 mg p.o. daily from 2 days before doxorubicin infusion). In the pretreatment group, the PEPI:LVETI ration and PEP index remained unchanged during the posttreatment period. Pharmacokinetic analysis of drug concentrations in the plasma revealed a significantly accelerated distribution and elimination of doxorubicin after combined tocopherol and nifedipine pretreatment, although no statistically significant differences could be found in calculated drug levels in the peripheral compartment between both treatment groups. Our results indicate that acute cardiac reactions reflected by changes in STI values can be prevented by combined tocopherol and nifedipine pretreatment.",0
Phase II study of triazinate and pyrazofurin in patients with advanced breast cancer previously exposed to cytotoxic chemotherapy.,"The purpose of this phase II clinical trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of triazinate and pyrazofurin in the treatment of advanced breast cancer. Although an occasional patient experienced stability of disease, neither agent, as employed in this study, was able to produce an objective antitumor effect in this group of patients with previous chemotherapeutic exposure. At the dosages used in this study, neither agent can be recommended for further treatment of advanced breast cancer.",1
Virtual reality intervention for older women with breast cancer.,"This study examined the effects of a virtual reality distraction intervention on chemotherapy-related symptom distress levels in 16 women aged 50 and older. A cross-over design was used to answer the following research questions: (1) Is virtual reality an effective distraction intervention for reducing chemotherapy-related symptom distress levels in older women with breast cancer? (2) Does virtual reality have a lasting effect? Chemotherapy treatments are intensive and difficult to endure. One way to cope with chemotherapy-related symptom distress is through the use of distraction. For this study, a head-mounted display (Sony PC Glasstron PLM - S700) was used to display encompassing images and block competing stimuli during chemotherapy infusions. The Symptom Distress Scale (SDS), Revised Piper Fatigue Scale (PFS), and the State Anxiety Inventory (SAI) were used to measure symptom distress. For two matched chemotherapy treatments, one pre-test and two post-test measures were employed. Participants were randomly assigned to receive the VR distraction intervention during one chemotherapy treatment and received no distraction intervention (control condition) during an alternate chemotherapy treatment. Analysis using paired t-tests demonstrated a significant decrease in the SAI (p = 0.10) scores immediately following chemotherapy treatments when participants used VR. No significant changes were found in SDS or PFS values. There was a consistent trend toward improved symptoms on all measures 48 h following completion of chemotherapy. Evaluation of the intervention indicated that women thought the head mounted device was easy to use, they experienced no cybersickness, and 100% would use VR again.",0
Multicenter randomized phase III study of the cardioprotective effect of dexrazoxane (Cardioxane) in advanced/metastatic breast cancer patients treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy.,"BACKGROUND: Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity has led to the adoption of empirical dose limits that may restrict continued use of anthracyclines among patients who might benefit. Dexrazoxane, a cardioprotective agent, has been shown to reduce the risk of anthracycline-associated cardiotoxicity when given from first dose of anthracycline. This study sought to confirm the benefit of dexrazoxane in patients at high risk of cardiotoxicity due to prior anthracycline use. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 164 female breast cancer patients, previously treated with anthracyclines, received anthracycline-based chemotherapy either with (n = 85) or without (n = 79) dexrazoxane for a maximum of six cycles. RESULTS: Compared with those receiving anthracycline alone, patients treated with dexrazoxane experienced significantly fewer cardiac events (39% versus 13%, P < 0.001) and a lower and less severe incidence of congestive heart failure (11% versus 1%, P < 0.05). Tumor response rate was unaffected by dexrazoxane therapy. The frequency of adverse events was similar between groups and there were no significant between-group differences in the number of dose modifications/interruptions. CONCLUSION: Dexrazoxane significantly reduced the occurrence and severity of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in patients at increased risk of cardiac dysfunction due to previous anthracycline treatment without compromising the antitumor efficacy of the chemotherapeutic regimen.",0

Activity of fulvestrant 500 mg versus anastrozole 1 mg as first-line treatment for advanced breast cancer: results from the FIRST study.,"PURPOSE: To compare the clinical activity of the pure antiestrogen fulvestrant at 500 mg/mo (double the approved dose) with the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole as first-line endocrine therapy for advanced hormone receptor-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women. PATIENTS AND METHODS: FIRST (Fulvestrant First-Line Study Comparing Endocrine Treatments) is a phase II, randomized, open-label, multicenter study of a fulvestrant high-dose (HD) regimen (500 mg/mo plus 500 mg on day 14 of month 1) versus anastrozole (1 mg/d). The primary efficacy end point was clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as the proportion of patients experiencing an objective response (OR) or stable disease for > or = 24 weeks. The primary analysis was performed 6 months after the last patient was randomly assigned. RESULTS: CBR was similar for fulvestrant HD (n = 102) and anastrozole (n = 103), 72.5% v 67.0%, respectively (odds ratio, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.72 to 2.38; P = .386). Objective response rate (ORR) was also similar between treatments: fulvestrant HD, 36.0%; anastrozole, 35.5%. Time to progression (TTP) was significantly longer for fulvestrant versus anastrozole (median TTP not reached for fulvestrant HD v 12.5 months for anastrozole; hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.39 to 1.00; P = .0496). Duration of OR and CB also numerically favored fulvestrant HD. Both treatments were well tolerated, with no significant differences in the incidence of prespecified adverse events. CONCLUSION: First-line fulvestrant HD was at least as effective as anastrozole for CBR and ORR and was associated with significantly longer TTP. Fulvestrant HD was generally well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that of anastrozole.",1
Neutrophil recovery in elderly breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant anthracycline-containing chemotherapy with pegfilgrastim support.,"Shortening duration of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia may reduce risk of infection and aid subsequent chemotherapy delivery. Cycle 1 neutrophil recovery was evaluated in 59 elderly women with breast cancer receiving adjuvant FEC100 (5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 100mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2)) and randomized to pegfilgrastim primary prophylaxis (PP) from cycle 1, or secondary prophylaxis (SP, i.e., subsequent to a neutropenic event [no G-CSF in cycle 1]). In cycle 1, grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 77% (PP; N=30) and 72% (SP; N=29). Duration of grade 3-4 neutropenia was shorter with pegfilgrastim than without. Mean absolute neutrophil count (ANC) recovered above 1.0 x 10(9)/L by day 9 (pegfilgrastim) versus days 16-18 (without). At last observation (> or =day 14+/-2), no PP patient had ANC <1.0 x 10(9)/L versus approximately 25% of those receiving no pegfilgrastim. In conclusion, cycle 1 pegfilgrastim improved recovery from severe neutropenia in elderly breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant FEC100.",0
Combination chemotherapy of metastatic breast cancer: a randomized trial comparing the use of adriamycin to that of Vinblastine.,"Two regimens of chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer were compared in a randomized controlled fashion. Regimen 1 consisted of cyclophosphamide, vinblastine, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CVMF). Regimen 2 consisted of cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CAMF). The patient population consisted of both black and white postmenopausal females who had not received any prior chemotherapy. Objective responses were observed in 25/57 patients treated with CVMF and in 28/51 patients treated with CAMF. Neither race nor choice of chemotherapeutic regimen affected prognosis, although there were differences in the pattern of metastatic involvement between the two racial groups. The median duration of survival of patients who responded to therapy has not yet been reached but will be in excess of 12 months.",1
A comparative study of bisantrene given by two dose schedules in patients with metastatic breast cancer.,"Schedule dependency of bisantrene was evaluated in refractory metastatic breast cancer. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a single (S) bolus injection of 300 mg/m2 (37 patients) or an injection of 80 mg/m2 daily for 5 days (D x 5) (35 patients) every 3-4 weeks after stratification by performance status, dominant disease site, and response to prior doxorubicin therapy. All but one patient had received prior doxorubicin. Partial remission (PR) was achieved by 5 of 35 patients (14%) in the S arm and 7 of 35 patients (20%) in the D X 5 arm (P = NS). There were 4 patients who had primary refractoriness to doxorubicin but responded to bisantrene. The median number of courses was two for both arms. The median time to progression was 5 months for the responders in each arm and 3 and 4 months, respectively, for patients who showed no change in the S and D X 5 arms. Myelo-suppression was dose-limiting and greater for the D X 5 arm. Drug fever (34% versus 21% of courses; P = 0.02) and myalgia (22% versus 10% of courses; P = 0.02) were reported more often in the D X 5 arm; malaise was greater in the S arm. Grade 2-3 nausea and vomiting occurred more often in the S arm (40% versus 10% of courses; P less than 0.01). Significant hypotension that was not symptomatic occurred in 1 patient in the D X 5 arm. Phlebitis occurred in 3 patients without a central line. One patient who had previously received doxorubicin and mitomycin C developed heart failure, which was controlled with medication. Bisantrene is an effective drug for metastatic breast cancer that has incomplete cross resistance to doxorubicin, and there was no schedule dependency in this study.",1

Serum methionine depletion without side effects by methioninase in metastatic breast cancer patients.,"The growth dependence of human tumors on elevated levels of methionine has been shown in preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies to be a frequently occurring, highly effective, tumor-selective therapeutic target. High purity endotoxin-free methioninase was produced from Pseudomonas putida in order to develop anti-methionine chemotherapy targeting of human tumors. A pilot Phase I clinical trial has been initiated in order to determine methioninase toxicity, the pharmacokinetics of methioninase and methionine-depletion and maximum tolerated dose. A two hour i.v. infusion of 5,000 units (0.4 g) and 10,000 units (0.8 g) and a ten hour i.v. infusion of 20,000 units (1.6 g) of methioninase was administered to patient-1, patient-2, and patient-3, respectively. All patients had advanced breast cancer. Blood and urine samples were obtained at frequent intervals between 0 and 24 hours. The toxicity evaluations were carried out according to FDA criteria. Pharmacokinetics data were obtained for both methioninase and methionine levels in the serum. No acute clinical toxicity was observed for all the toxicity criteria measured in patient-1, patient-2 and patient-3. The depletion of serum methionine started within 30 minutes of the infusion, and was maintained for 4 hours after the infusion was completed in patient-1 and patient-2. The lowest serum methionine levels were 35% and 19% of the pretreatment level, respectively, in patient-1 and patient-2. Patient-3 received a ten hour i.v. infusion of 20,000 units of methioninase without any signs of side effects. Patient-3 maintained serum levels of methioninase as high as 50% of the maximum level for a subsequent 6 hours after infusion. Methionine was depleted over 200-fold from 23.1 microM to 0.1 microM by the 10-hour infusion of patient-3. No clinical toxicity was observed whatsoever in all the toxicity criteria measured in patient-3. The results of the methioninase pilot Phase 1 clinical trial suggested that i.v. infusion of the methioninase is safe and effectively depletes serum methionine without any signs of side effects. Clinical studies are continuing to determine the maximum length of time complete serum methionine depletion can be tolerated.",0
Maintaining normal hemoglobin levels with epoetin alfa in mainly nonanemic patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving first-line chemotherapy: a survival study.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect on survival and quality of life of maintaining hemoglobin (Hb) in the range of 12 to 14 g/dL with epoetin alfa versus placebo in women with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) receiving first-line chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive epoetin alfa 40,000 U once weekly or placebo for 12 months. Study drug was initiated if baseline Hb was < or = 13 g/dL or when Hb decreased to < or = 13g/dL during the study. The primary end point was 12-month overall survival (OS). RESULTS: The study drug administration was stopped early in accordance with a recommendation from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee because of higher mortality in the group treated with epoetin alfa. Enrollment had been completed, with 939 patients enrolled (epoetin alfa, n = 469; placebo, n = 470). Most patients had Hb more than 12 g/dL at baseline (median Hb, 12.8 g/dL) or during the study. From the final analysis, 12-month OS was 70% for epoetin alfa recipients and 76% for placebo recipients (P = .01). Optimal tumor response and time to disease progression were similar between groups. The reason for the difference in mortality between groups could not be determined from additional subsequent analyses involving both study data and chart review. CONCLUSION: In this trial, the use of epoetin alfa to maintain high Hb targets in women with MBC, most of whom did not have anemia at the start of treatment, was associated with decreased survival. Additional research is required to clarify the potential impact of erythropoietic agents on survival when the Hb target range is 10 to 12 g/dL.",0
Chemotherapy-induced tumor gene expression changes in human breast cancers.,"OBJECTIVE: Studying chemotherapy-induced gene expression changes in vivo, which could provide insights into mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance. METHODS: We analyzed and compared tumor gene expression changes of about 38 500 genes before and 3 weeks after doxorubicin or docetaxel treatment in 47 breast cancer patients. RESULTS: By using the median expression level of each probe set as the parameter, less than 5% of genes were upregulated or downregulated by more than 50% after treatment with either drug. Doxorubicin and docetaxel concordantly induced 251 genes predominantly involved in protein and macromolecule metabolism (upregulated), and cell cycle and DNA/RNA metabolism (downregulated). Doxorubicin treatment resulted in coregulation of a cluster of 345 probe sets involved in focal adhesion, Jak-Stat signaling pathway, cell adhesion molecules, and natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, whereas docetaxel treatment resulted in coregulation of a cluster of 448 probe sets involved in focal adhesion, neurodegenerative disorders, sphingolipid metabolism, and cell cycle. Tumors that were intrinsically sensitive or resistant to doxorubicin or docetaxel evoked distinct gene expression changes in response to the drug; doxorubicin-resistant tumors upregulated genes that were enriched for ErbB signaling, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, TGF-beta signaling, and MAP-kinase signaling pathways, whereas docetaxel-resistant tumors upregulated genes that were enriched for focal adhesion and regulation of actin cytoskeleton. The drug-specific tumor gene expression changes were validated in independent in-vitro and in-vivo datasets. CONCLUSION: Gene expression alterations of breast cancer were specific to doxorubicin and docetaxel treatment, and yielded mechanistic insights into resistance to either drug. Gene expression analysis provides more global perspectives on resistance pathways that could be exploited for therapeutic selection.",0
Duration of tamoxifen effect on lipidemic profile of postmenopausal breast cancer patients following deprivation of treatment.,"OBJECTIVE: It was the aim of this study to investigate the effect of tamoxifen withdrawal on markers of lipid metabolism in postmenopausal women with breast cancer who completed tamoxifen therapy and received no further treatment. METHODS: Lipidemic profile changes were studied in 190 postmenopausal patients with operable breast cancer, following cessation of 5-7 years of tamoxifen treatment. Assessments of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein and total serum triglycerides were performed at baseline, 6 months and 12 months. RESULTS: By 6 months, both total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels were significantly increased, and total triglyceride levels were significantly reduced compared with baseline values and maintained to 12 months. There was no significant alteration observed for high-density lipoprotein levels over the study period. CONCLUSION: The beneficial effect of tamoxifen on the lipidemic profile of postmenopausal breast cancer patients seems to be lost in less than 12 months time following cessation of 5-7 years of tamoxifen treatment. A 'rebound effect' on the lipidemic parameters should be expected and those patients should be monitored carefully.",0
Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin plus docetaxel significantly improves time to progression without additive cardiotoxicity compared with docetaxel monotherapy in patients with advanced breast cancer previously treated with neoadjuvant-adjuvant anthracycline therapy: results from a randomized phase III study.,"PURPOSE: To determine whether the combination of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) and docetaxel significantly prolongs time to disease progression compared with docetaxel alone without an increase in cardiac toxicity in women with advanced breast cancer who had experienced relapse at least 1 year after prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant anthracycline therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This international, phase III study randomly assigned 751 patients to receive either docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) (n = 373) or PLD 30 mg/m(2) followed by docetaxel 60 mg/m(2) every 21 days (n = 378) and continued until disease progression or prohibitive toxicity. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP). Secondary end points were overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), cardiac toxicity, and safety. RESULTS: Treatment with PLD-docetaxel significantly improved median TTP from 7.0 to 9.8 months (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.65; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.77; P = .000001) and the ORR from 26% to 35% (P = .0085). OS was similar between the two groups (HR = 1.02; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.22). The incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse events were similar (78% v 72%), although a higher incidence of hand-foot syndrome (24% v 0%) and mucositis/stomatitis (12% v 1%) were observed in the PLD-docetaxel combination. Protocol-defined left ventricular ejection fraction decreases and congestive heart failure were reported in 5% and 1% in both treatment arms, respectively. CONCLUSION: The PLD-docetaxel combination was more effective than docetaxel alone in women with metastatic breast cancer who had experienced relapse at least 1 year after prior adjuvant anthracycline therapy without an increase in cardiac toxicity, although mucocutaneous toxicity was more common.",1
Effect of tamoxifen on serum insulinlike growth factor I levels in stage I breast cancer patients.,"Insulinlike growth factor I (IGF-I) has been shown to be a potent mitogen for breast cancer cells in vitro, and IGF-I receptors have been demonstrated on human primary breast neoplasms. In a randomized, placebo-controlled study, we document that administration of the antiestrogen tamoxifen to patients with breast cancer was associated with a statistically significant (P = .002) reduction in the serum level of IGF-I. The mean IGF-I level was 1.4 U/mL in the placebo-treated group and 0.9 U/mL in the tamoxifen-treated group. Because serum IGF-I level is growth hormone (GH) dependent and because data suggest that the pubertal surge in GH and IGF-I levels is sex steroid dependent, we speculate that the mechanism underlying our observation may involve blockade by tamoxifen of estrogen action in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. We conclude that tamoxifen treatment reduces IGF-I levels and that this reduction may contribute to the therapeutic effect of the drug.",0
Randomized phase II trial of iproplatin and carboplatin in advanced breast cancer. The EORTC Early Clinical Trials Group and the EORTC Data Center.,"BACKGROUND: The observed activity of cisplatin in breast cancer and its unattractive toxicity profile in palliative treatment warranted further study of platinum analogues in this disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-two patients with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer, 61 of whom had been previously treated with chemotherapy, were randomly assigned to therapy with either iproplatin (n = 32) or carboplatin (n = 30). Both platinum analogues were administered intravenously, iproplatin at a dose of 240 mg/m2 every 4 weeks and carboplatin at a dose of 450 mg/m2 every 5 weeks. RESULTS: Only two patients responded to iproplatin (7%) for durations of 21 and 61 weeks, and one patient responded to carboplatin (3%) for a duration of 64 weeks. All responses were complete. At the given dose schedules carboplatin was more myelosuppressive than iproplatin. Non-hematologic toxicities included nausea and vomiting (93% vs. 90%), diarrhea (20% vs. 10%) and hemorrhage (16% vs. 10%) for iproplatin and carboplatin, respectively. Two patients developed alopecia with carboplatin. No renal toxicity was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Both iproplatin and carboplatin have limited activity in previously treated women with advanced breast cancer when given in conventional dosages.",1

Weekly paclitaxel versus weekly docetaxel in elderly or frail patients with metastatic breast carcinoma: a randomized phase-II study of the Belgian Society of Medical Oncology.,"This randomized phase-II trial investigated the efficacy and tolerability of weekly docetaxel or paclitaxel in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients considered unfit for a 3-weekly therapy. The primary study endpoint was antitumor activity, the second endpoint was tolerability, time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS). In intent-to-treat analysis, we observed for paclitaxel and docetaxel respectively partial response (PR) in 48% versus 38%, stable disease (SD) in 24% versus 16%, PD in 15% versus 30%. Median TTP was 21.1 weeks versus 12.7 weeks and median OS 55.7 weeks versus 32 weeks. Toxicity profiles were acceptable with more anemia and neurotoxicity for paclitaxel and more edema and fatigue for docetaxel. In patients with MBC unfit for 3-weekly docetaxel or paclitaxel, weekly administration of either compound may certainly be considered. They display different, but acceptable toxicity profiles, with levels of antitumoral efficacy comparable to those previously reported for 3-weekly regimens.",1
Japanese early phase II study of droloxifene in the treatment of advanced breast cancer. Preliminary dose-finding study.,"Droloxifene, a new tamoxifen (TAM)-derived compound, has excellent antiestrogenic activity. This compound exhibits less endogenously estrogenic but higher antiestrogenic activity, with better tolerability than TAM in experimental models. Two phase II studies of droloxifene were performed in 47 Japanese institutions to assess the optimal dose. The first was a randomized comparative study using 20, 40, and 80 mg, respectively, once a day. The other was a pilot study using 120 mg once a day. The subjects of both studies were women with primary or recurrent advanced breast cancer, regardless of estrogen receptor status and menopausal status. Of 94 patients enrolled in the comparative study, 22, 26, and 23 were evaluable in the 20-, 40-, and 80-mg groups, respectively. Of the 71 evaluable patients, 14 (19.7%) were negative for estrogen receptor, and 36 (50.7%) had a previous history of TAM therapy. The response rate complete response + partial response (CR + PR) was 13.6% for 20 mg, 15.4% for 40 mg, and 17.4% for 80 mg. The rate of no change (NC) was 31.9%, 46.1%, and 47.8%, and that of progressive disease (PD) was 54.5%, 38.5% and 34.8%, respectively, in the 20-, 40-, and 80-mg groups. In the other study, 16 patients were enrolled in the pilot study with 120 mg of droloxifene, of whom 14 were evaluable. The response rate was slightly higher: four responders (28.6%) were assessed as CR + PR, six (42.9%) as NC, and four (28.6%) as PD. These results suggest that the response rate may be dose-dependent and that PD rates seem lower in the higher doses. No serious side effects were encountered, and droloxifene was well tolerated even in the higher doses. At present, a final randomized dose-finding study with 80 mg/day and 120 mg/day is being carried out.",1
"Effect of subcutaneous granulocyte colony-stimulating factor injectate volume on drug efficacy, site complications, and client comfort.","PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of administering 1.6 ml (480 mcg) of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in one subcutaneous injection or two injections of 0.8 ml each. DESIGN: Experimental. SETTING: 27-bed bone marrow transplant intensive care unit of a metropolitan, university medical center in the southwestern United States. SAMPLE: Nonprobability; 76 women who received high-dose chemotherapy for breast cancer followed by hemopoietic rescue. METHODS: Subjects were randomized into an experimental group that received one injection per 480 mcg dose and a control group that received two injections per 480 mcg dose administered by research associates using a standardized injection technique. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Injectate volume. The number of days post-transplant until the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) returned to 1,000/mm3, the incidence and surface area in mm2 of site complications, and scores on Tursky's Quantified Pain Descriptor immediately following the injection(s). FINDINGS: No significant difference existed between the two groups in ANC recovery time, frequency or size of site complications, or intensity, reaction, or sensation of discomfort reported. CONCLUSIONS: Administering 1.6 ml doses of G-CSF in one injection instead of two does not result in slower ANC recovery, induration, more frequent or larger bruises or areas of erythema, or greater client discomfort. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Administering one injection instead of two may decrease patients' anxiety, the nursing time needed for preparation and administration of injections, patient instruction for self-administration, the potential for contamination of vials or loss of dose, and the cost of supplies.",0
Effect of tamoxifen on Ki67 labelling index in human breast tumours and its relationship to oestrogen and progesterone receptor status.,"This study aimed to investigate the effect of tamoxifen on breast tumour levels of oestrogen and progesterone receptor (ER and PR) and proliferation as defined by the Ki67 antibody. A group of primary breast cancer patients was randomised to receive either tamoxifen (n = 59) or placebo (n = 44) treatment in the interval between clinic and surgery (median 21 days). Frozen sections of breast tumour biopsies obtained before and after treatment were stained immunocytochemically to obtain the percentage of nuclei containing ER and PR, and a Ki67 labelling index (LI). Tamoxifen-treated patients had a median Ki67 LI of 5.6% in the first biopsy falling to 3.0% in the second biopsy (P < 0.001 by Wilcoxon's matched pairs test), whereas placebo-treated patients had a median Ki67 LI of 5.4% in the first biopsy and 5.75% in the second (no significant difference). No significant differences were observed when the median %ER or %PR staining before and after treatment were compared. The Ki67 LI tended to increase with increasing histological grade and was greater in tumours that were ER - ve compared to those that were ER + ve (> 5% nuclei stained), median 7.8% and 4.3% respectively (P = 0.011 by Mann-Whitney U-test). However, the decline in tumour Ki67 LI following anti-oestrogen treatment failed to correlate with ER and PR status or to predict recurrence over a short follow-up period. To our knowledge, this is the first time that tamoxifen treatment has been shown to reduce the Ki67 LI in human breast tumours in vivo. These data indicate that staining with the Ki67 antibody may be useful in monitoring response to anti-oestrogen therapy.",0
Interrupted versus continuous chemotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The Piedmont Oncology Association.,"BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer is palliative, and the optimal duration of therapy is unknown. We designed a trial to determine whether continuous treatment is superior to stopping treatment after a brief induction period and resuming treatment when the disease progresses. METHODS: We treated 250 women with metastatic breast cancer with six courses of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil given every three weeks. At the completion of this induction period, women whose disease either regressed or remained stable were randomly assigned to receive either continued treatment with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (maintenance therapy) or no further treatment (observation) followed by treatment with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil when disease progression became evident (reinduction). RESULTS: The combined rate of complete and partial responses after initial therapy was 30 percent (71 of 233 patients who could be evaluated; 95 percent confidence interval, 25 percent to 37 percent). In another 42 percent (98 patients), the disease remained stable. A total of 145 patients were randomized. Seventy-one were randomly assigned to the maintenance-therapy group, and 74 to the observation group. The median time to progression was 9.4 months for patients in the maintenance-therapy group and 3.2 months for patients in the observation group (P less than 0.001). After reinduction therapy, the median time to progression was 3.5 months. The median length of survival from the time of initial therapy was 14.8 months for all 250 patients; it was 21.1 months for the 71 patients in the maintenance-therapy group and 19.6 months for the 74 patients in the observation group (P = 0.67). Maintenance therapy was the most important determinant of the time before progression (P less than 0.001), but it was not associated with prolonged survival. The changes in performance status were similar in the patients in both groups, but nausea, vomiting, and mucositis were significantly more frequent in the maintenance-therapy group. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with breast cancer who received induction chemotherapy for 18 weeks, subsequent continuous chemotherapy was associated with a significant prolongation of the time before progression as compared with those receiving no further therapy; overall survival, however, was not significantly different in the two groups.",1
"Randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial comparing two doses of arzoxifene (LY353381) in hormone-sensitive advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients.","BACKGROUND: This randomized, double-blind, phase II study assessed two doses of the selective estrogen receptor modulator arzoxifene in women with advanced breast cancer. The primary end point was to choose the best of two doses of arzoxifene based on the response rate or the clinical benefit rate (CBR). Pharmacokinetics and toxicities were also assessed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-two patients with advanced breast cancer received arzoxifene 20 or 50 mg/day. Tumor response was assessed using World Health Organization criteria. Toxicities were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) system. Pharmacokinetic data were analyzed using the NONMEM software program (GloboMax, Hanover, MD, USA). RESULTS: Response rates in the 20 mg arm were numerically higher than the 50-mg arm according to the investigator (40.5% versus 36.4%) and the independent review panel (42.9% versus 27.3%). CBR was higher in the 20 mg arm according to the investigator (64.3% versus 61.4%) and the independent review panel (59.5% versus 47.7%). Arzoxifene was well tolerated. There were no study drug-related deaths. Mean observed steady-state plasma concentrations of arzoxifene were 3.62 and 7.48 ng/ml for the 20 and 50 mg doses, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences in efficacy or safety between 20 and 50 mg of arzoxifene. Accordingly, arzoxifene 20 mg/day was selected for further study in patients with breast cancer.",1
Breast-cancer adjuvant therapy with zoledronic acid.,"BACKGROUND: Data suggest that the adjuvant use of bisphosphonates reduces rates of recurrence and death in patients with early-stage breast cancer. We conducted a study to determine whether treatment with zoledronic acid, in addition to standard adjuvant therapy, would improve disease outcomes in such patients. METHODS: In this open-label phase 3 study, we randomly assigned 3360 patients to receive standard adjuvant systemic therapy either with or without zoledronic acid. The zoledronic acid was administered every 3 to 4 weeks for 6 doses and then every 3 to 6 months to complete 5 years of treatment. The primary end point of the study was disease-free survival. A second interim analysis revealed that a prespecified boundary for lack of benefit had been crossed. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 59 months, there was no significant between-group difference in the primary end point, with a rate of disease-free survival of 77% in each group (adjusted hazard ratio in the zoledronic acid group, 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85 to 1.13; P=0.79). Disease recurrence or death occurred in 377 patients in the zoledronic acid group and 375 of those in the control group. The numbers of deaths--243 in the zoledronic acid group and 276 in the control group--were also similar, resulting in rates of overall survival of 85.4% in the zoledronic acid group and 83.1% in the control group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.01; P=0.07). In the zoledronic acid group, there were 17 confirmed cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw (cumulative incidence, 1.1%; 95% CI, 0.6 to 1.7; P<0.001) and 9 suspected cases; there were no cases in the control group. Rates of other adverse effects were similar in the two study groups. CONCLUSIONS: These findings do not support the routine use of zoledronic acid in the adjuvant management of breast cancer.

"Risedronate prevents bone loss in breast cancer survivors: a 2-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.","PURPOSE: Limited data are available on the efficacy of oral bisphosphonate therapy in breast cancer survivors. Our goal was to examine prevention of breast cancer-related bone loss in this cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-seven postmenopausal women after chemotherapy for breast cancer were randomly assigned to once-weekly risedronate 35 mg or placebo for 24 months. Outcomes included bone mineral density (BMD) and turnover markers. RESULTS: At study initiation, 13% of patients were on an aromatase inhibitor (AI). After 24 months, there were differences of 1.6 to 2.5% (P < .05) at the spine and hip BMD between the placebo and risedronate groups. At study completion, 44% were on an AI. Adjusting for an AI, women on placebo plus AI had a decrease in BMD of (mean +/- SE) 4.8% +/- 0.8% at the spine and 2.8% +/- 0.5% at the total hip (both P < .001). In women on risedronate + AI, the spine decreased by 2.4% +/- 1.1% (P < .05) and was stable at the hip. Women in the placebo group not on an AI, maintained BMD at the spine, and had a 1.2% +/- 0.5% loss at the total hip (P < .05). Women who received risedronate but no AI had the greatest improvement in BMD of 2.2% +/- 0.9% (P < .05) at the total hip. Bone turnover was reduced with risedronate. There were no differences in adverse events between the groups. CONCLUSION: We conclude that in postmenopausal women with breast cancer with or without AI therapy, once-weekly oral risedronate was beneficial for spine and hip BMD, reduced bone turnover, and was well tolerated.",0
Effect of tamoxifen on lumbar spine bone mineral density in postmenopausal women after 5 years.,"BACKGROUND: Because adjuvant tamoxifen citrate is given to women with early-stage breast cancer for long periods, it is important to know how it affects risk factors for osteoporotic bone fractures, particularly since rates of bone fracture increase rapidly with age in postmenopausal women. In a 2-year randomized placebo-controlled toxicity study in 140 subjects, we demonstrated that tamoxifen was associated with preservation of bone mineral density (BMD), a major risk factor for fractures, in the lumbar spine. METHODS: Five years after entry on this study we reexamined 62 of the original subjects with lumbar spine BMD and serum osteocalcin measurements. These were women available for study because they had not suffered major illnesses and had continued to receive (1) tamoxifen or (2) the no-tamoxifen regimen that they had originally been randomized to receive for the entire 5 years. RESULTS: For lumbar spine BMD at baseline, the 30 subjects in the long-term tamoxifen group and the 32 subjects in the long-term no-tamoxifen group were not significantly different (P = .26). During the first 2 years of follow-up, the 30 subjects in the long-term tamoxifen group showed the same BMD pattern as the entire 70-patient tamoxifen cohort, and similarly the 32 subjects in the long-term no-tamoxifen group showed the same pattern as the entire 70-patient cohort who received placebo. Five-year mean BMD measurements for each long-term follow-up group showed no significant changes from their respective 2-year levels. However, 5-year BMD measurements between the two groups differed (tamoxifen group, +0.8%; placebo group, -0.7%) (P = .06), and the mean regression lines for the changes in BMD over 5 years differed significantly between the two groups (P = .0005). Adjustment for differences in body mass index, reported exercise, and calcium supplementation between these two groups did not change these results. Osteocalcin levels, also comparable at baseline in the two groups, were significantly lower in tamoxifen-treated subjects at 5 years (P = .0005). CONCLUSIONS: While remodeling of bone may be lower, resorption of lumbar spine bone mineral is also lower, and tamoxifen preserves BMD in the lumbar spine over 5 years of treatment in postmenopausal women. Over longer periods, this preservation of BMD might be expected to be associated with lower fracture rates.",0

Italian Breast Cancer Adjuvant Chemo-Hormone Therapy Cooperative Group Trials. GROCTA Trials.,"The first GROCTA trial compared 5-year tamoxifen treatment to ten chemotherapy cycles in a group of 504 pre-/post-menopausal, node-positive, ER-positive breast cancer patients. This study also included an arm combining tamoxifen with chemotherapy. Fifteen-year results showed no difference between tamoxifen and tamoxifen plus chemotherapy, while both treatments were significantly superior to chemotherapy alone. A confirmatory study (GROCTA 02) was performed in 244 pre-/perimenopausal patients by comparing 5 years of tamoxifen treatment (plus 2 years of goserelin) to six CMF cycles. No difference has emerged so far between the tamoxifen and CMF arms at a median follow-up time of 62 months. Post-menopausal women were scheduled to receive 3 years of tamoxifen treatment and then to be randomly allocated to further 2 years of tamoxifen or to 2 years of low-dose aminoglutethimide (GROCTA 04B). So far 662 patients have been entered, 375 of whom have been randomized to tamoxifen (n = 188) or aminoglutethimide (n = 187). Preliminary results (median follow-up time 32 months) show no major difference in patients' outcome. A new trial (ITA trial) with a similar design but employing anastrozole in place of aminoglutethimide has been activated in 1998. The GROCTA 03 study investigated the potential superiority of alternating adjuvant chemotherapy over standard CMF. This study, which included 107 node-positive ER-negative pre-menopausal women, was prematurely closed because more patients allocated to the triple alternated chemotherapy appeared to have relapsed and died at the first interim analysis. The use of high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) was explored by the GROCTA 06 trial which included 53 patients with ten or more involved nodes and a maximum age of 55 years. These patients were scheduled to receive three standard CEF cycles followed by one cycle of HDC (cyclophosphamide 5 g/m2; etoposide 1.5 g/m2; cisplatin 150 mg/m2) without any form of bone marrow rescue. This HDC program proved to be feasible but was not superior to CMF-based chemotherapy we had previously employed in a comparable group of patients in previous GROCTA trials. These findings prompted us to explore new HDC programmes with the use of peripheral stem cell support and in addition the possible value of new drugs such as Taxol and vinorelbine. New-generation trials will also explore the value of new prognostic indicators such as tumor proliferative activity, which are prospectively used to allocate patients to different treatment options.",0
Treatment of node-negative breast cancer patients with short course of chemotherapy immediately after surgery.,"In our first study, one short course of chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, 5 mg/kg/day for 6 days iv) was given perioperatively to 507 patients with operable primary breast cancer; there were 519 control subjects. Randomization was done by telephone from the operating theater, and stratification was by hospital only. The side effects were negligible. With 20-year follow-up, the relapse rate was 60.5% in the control group and 48% in the treatment group (P less than 0.001). The overall survival benefit was marginally significant, but with correction for deaths not related to cancer, P was less than 0.02. A total of 309 patients in the treatment group and 301 in the control group were histologically node negative. The observed benefit in this subgroup was as good as in the node-positive subgroup, but the relapses were too few for testing of meaningful significance. In our second study, all patients received one short perioperative course, and the node-positive patients were randomized between control or continued chemotherapy for 1 year. This improved the beneficial results but also considerably increased the side effects.",1
A randomized comparison of single-agent doxorubicin and epirubicin as first-line cytotoxic therapy in advanced breast cancer.,"One hundred forty-one patients with advanced breast cancer who had not received prior chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 or epirubicin 90 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. These doses were selected to produce equivalent toxicities. All patients were assessed for toxicity, and 138 patients were assessable for response. After a median of five treatment cycles, 47% (32 of 68) of doxorubicin-treated patients achieved a partial or complete response. Response duration and survival were 10 and 12 months for doxorubicin and 8 and 10 months for epirubicin, respectively. Noncardiac toxicities were similar for both drugs. Of 41 patients receiving doxorubicin who had serial left ventricular ejection fraction assessments, seven sustained a fall of 10% or more, and one patient developed congestive cardiac failure at a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 489 mg/m2. Of 39 patients receiving epirubicin who had serial cardiac assessments, five sustained left ventricular ejection fraction falls of 10% or more and two patients developed congestive cardiac failure at cumulative doses of 178 mg/m2 and 833 mg/m2. These data indicate that an epirubicin dose of 90 mg/m2 produces toxicity equivalent to doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 but does not improve response rates, response duration, or survival in advanced breast cancer.",1
"Fadrozole hydrochloride, a new nontoxic aromatase inhibitor for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer.","Eighty previously treated postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive fadrozole (CGS 16 949A), a new aromatase inhibitor, 1 or 4 mg orally per day. Seventy eight patients were evaluable for toxicity and response. Only mild to moderate toxicity, namely hot flushes (28%), nausea and vomiting (13%), fatigue (8%) and loss of appetite (5%) occurred. Complete response was documented in 10% and partial response in 13% of patients with 45% having a no change status for at least 2 months. The median time to treatment failure is 4.1 months. The median survival is 23.7 months. The median survival is 23.7 months. The response and survival in patients with estrogen receptor positive and estrogen receptor unknown disease were not significantly different. Neither response nor survival was significantly different between the patients receiving 1 or 4 mg of fadrozole per day. Fadrozole is a well tolerated, effective second line treatment for women with metastatic breast cancer.",1

Weekly combination of non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin and taxane in first-line breast cancer: wALT trial (phase I-II).,"BACKGROUND: Through different pharmacodynamic-kinetic interactions, weekly administration of proved efficacy agents can overcome resistance with lower toxicity and greater benefit. Based on this assumption, we designed a phase I-II trial with weekly non-pegylated liposomal anthracycline and taxane in first-line breast cancer patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 56 previously untreated metastatic breast cancer patients; they were randomly assigned to receive paclitaxel (Taxol) (50 mg/mq) or docetaxel (Taxotere) (30 mg/mq) combined with non-pegylated liposomal anthracycline (25 mg/mq) on days 1, 8 and 15 every 4 weeks. The primary end points were the clinical benefit and treatment-related toxic effects assessment. Secondary end points were time-to-disease progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: The overall clinical benefit was 87.04%. World Health Organization G3-4 toxic effects included neutropenia (45%), anemia (44%), complete alopecia (83%), severe onycholysis and neuropathy. The 24% of patients developed left ventricular ejection fraction reduction but none >10% with recover after treatment completion. The median absolute decrease from baseline was 1%. Median TTP was 11 months and median OS was 23 months.CONCLUSIONS: Combined weekly administration of taxane and non-pegylated liposomal anthracycline is well tolerated and clinical benefit data encourage phase III study design.",1
Randomized phase II trial of rubidazone and adriamycin in women with advanced breast cancer.,"Thirty-eight females with advanced breast cancer who had failed prior chemotherapy were entered in a randomized study of rubidazone (150 mg/m2 iv over 1 hour) versus Adriamycin (60 mg/m2 iv over 5 minutes), both given every 4 weeks. The two treatment groups each contained 19 patients and were similar with respect to age, menopausal status, dominant disease status, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score, and prior hormonal therapy and chemotherapy exposure. No regressions (complete or partial) were observed with rubidazone, but four (21%) patients achieved regressions (one complete and three partial) with Adriamycin. Considering all cycles, hematologic toxicity included leukopenia (wbc count nadir of less than 4000/mm3) in 88% of patients receiving rubidazone and in 89% of those receiving Adriamycin. Three of eight patients treated with Adriamycin after rubidazone failure achieved a regression. Rubidazone appears to be of little value in the treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer who have failed prior chemotherapy.",1
"A randomized clinical trial of adjuvant chemotherapy for radically resected locoregional relapse of breast cancer: IBCSG 27-02, BIG 1-02, and NSABP B-37.","In this phase III, multinational, randomized trial, the International Breast Cancer Study Group, Breast International Group, and the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project will attempt to define the effectiveness of cytotoxic therapy for patients with locoregional recurrence of breast cancer. We will evaluate whether chemotherapy prolongs disease-free survival and, secondarily, whether its use improves overall survival and systemic disease-free survival. Quality of life measurements will be monitored during the first 12 months of the study. Women who have had a previous diagnosis of invasive breast cancer treated by mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery and who have undergone complete surgical excision of all macroscopic disease but who subsequently develop isolated local and/or regional ipsilateral invasive recurrence are eligible. Patients are randomized to observation/no adjuvant chemotherapy or to adjuvant chemotherapy; all suitable patients receive radiation, hormonal, and trastuzumab therapy. Radiation therapy is recommended for patients who have not received previous adjuvant radiation therapy but is required for those with microscopically positive margins. The radiation field must encompass the tumor bed plus a surrounding margin to a dose of >or= 40 Gy. Radiation therapy will be administered before, during, or after chemotherapy. All women with estrogen receptor-positive and/or progesterone receptor-positive recurrence must receive hormonal therapy, with the agent and duration to be determined by the patient's investigator. Adjuvant trastuzumab therapy is permitted for those with HER2- positive tumors, provided that intent to treat is declared before randomization. Although multidrug regimens are preferred, the agents, doses, and use of supportive therapy are at the discretion of the investigator.",0

Influence of Ukrain on patients with surgically treated breast cancer. Part II. Hormonal profile.,"The present study was undertaken to evaluate the influence of Ukrain on the hormonal status of ten patients with breast cancer, treated in the preoperative phase by Ukrain. A control group consisted of eight patients of similar age and advancement of the disease, who did not receive the drug before mastectomy. The data were compared to those obtained in ten healthy women of similar age. The results indicate that Ukrain only slightly influences the hormonal dynamics and its destructive mode of action on neoplastic tissue does not significantly affect hormonal activities.",0
"Prevention of bone loss in survivors of breast cancer: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.","BACKGROUND: Few data are available on the safety and efficacy of once-weekly oral bisphosphonate therapy in breast cancer survivors. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine whether risedronate, 35 mg weekly, is efficacious and safe in preventing bone loss associated with chemotherapy-induced menopause. DESIGN: The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial over 12 months. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 87 newly postmenopausal women with status post chemotherapy, recruited from a breast cancer clinic in an academic medical center. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned to receive risedronate 35 mg/wk or placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were the 12-month changes in spine and hip bone mineral density. Secondary outcomes included changes in markers of bone resorption (urine N-telopeptide cross-linked collagen type I) and formation (osteocalcin, N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen, and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase). RESULTS: After 12 months, bone mineral density increased by 1.2% at the spine and 1.3% at the hip in women on risedronate vs. significant decreases for women in the placebo group of 0.9% at the spine and 0.8% at the hip (P < 0.01, difference between groups). N-telopeptide cross-linked collagen type I, a marker of bone resorption, decreased by 19.3%, and N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen, a marker of bone formation, decreased by 26.6% in participants on active therapy compared with increases in the control group. Risedronate was well tolerated, and the retention rate was 95% at 1 yr. CONCLUSIONS: Risedronate once weekly prevented bone loss and reduced bone turnover in women with breast cancer treated with chemotherapy. Early measures to prevent bone loss should be considered in this cohort of breast cancer survivors.",0
Aminoterminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP) correlates to bone loss and predicts the efficacy of antiresorptive therapy in pre- and post-menopausal non-metastatic breast cancer patients.,"The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between changes in collagen metabolites (ICTP, mature cross-linked carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen; PINP, the amino-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen) and bone mineral density (BMD) in 206 pre- and post-menopausal breast cancer patients with non-metastatic disease. All patients received adjuvant cancer treatment--premenopausal patients chemotherapy and post-menopausal patients anti-oestrogens. In addition, the patients were also randomized to receive oral clodronate 1600 mg daily for 3 years. BMD was measured at baseline and at 1 and 2 years, the collagen metabolites at baseline and at 1 year. There was a highly significant negative correlation between the changes in PINP and BMD in lumbar spine and femoral neck from baseline to 12 months in all patients (r(s) = -0.68, P < 0.0001, and -0.45, P < 0.0001, respectively), and in pre- and post-menopausal patients separately. The changes in PINP levels at 12 months predict further changes in BMD at 24 months (r = -0.70, P < 0.0001, and -0.51, P < 0.0001, respectively). ICTP and BMD changes correlated significantly only in lumbar spine of premenopausal patients who developed rapid bone loss due to chemotherapy-induced amenorrhoea (r(s) = -0.34, P = 0.0003). The PINP levels at 12 months were significantly lower in the clodronate group than in the control group (P < 0.0001). Our results indicate that PINP is a sensitive marker of bone turnover rate. Changes in PINP levels significantly predicted changes in BMD and correlated with the antiresorptive efficacy of clodronate treatment.",0
Venlafaxine in management of hot flashes in survivors of breast cancer: a randomised controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Hot flashes can be troublesome, especially when hormonal therapy is contraindicated. Preliminary data have suggested that newer antidepressants, such as venlafaxine, can diminish hot flashes. We undertook a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial to assess the efficacy of venlafaxine in women with a history of breast cancer or reluctance to take hormonal treatment because of fear of breast cancer. METHODS: Participants were assigned placebo (n=56) or venlafaxine 37.5 mg daily (n=56), 75 mg daily (n=55), or 150 mg daily (n=54). After a baseline assessment week, patients took the study medication for 4 weeks. All venlafaxine treatment started at 37.5 mg daily and gradually increased in the 75 mg and 150 mg groups. Patients completed daily hot-flash questionnaire diaries. The primary endpoint was average daily hot-flash activity (number of flashes and a score combining number and severity). Analyses were based on the women who provided data throughout the baseline and study weeks. FINDINGS: 191 patients had evaluable data for the whole study period (50 placebo, 49 venlafaxine 37.5 mg, 43 venlafaxine 75 mg, 49 venlafaxine 150 mg). After week 4 of treatment, median hot flash scores were reduced from baseline by 27% (95% CI 11-34), 37% (26-54), 61% (50-68), and 61% (48-75) in the four groups. Frequencies of some side-effects (mouth dryness, decreased appetite, nausea, and constipation) were significantly higher in the venlafaxine 75 mg and 150 mg groups than in the placebo group. INTERPRETATION: Venlafaxine is an effective non-hormonal treatment for hot flashes, though the efficacy must be balanced against the drug's side-effects. Confirmation of the results of this 4-week study awaits the completion of three ongoing randomised studies to assess the effects of other related antidepressants for the treatment of hot flashes.",0
The Italian breast cancer prevention trial with tamoxifen: findings and new perspectives.,"The Italian Tamoxifen Prevention Study includes 5408 healthy hysterectomized women aged 35-70 years who have been randomized to 20 mg/day of tamoxifen or placebo for 5 years. After 46 months median follow-up, an increased risk of venous vascular events (38 women on tamoxifen vs. 18 women on placebo, P = 0.0053), mainly consisting of superficial phlebitis, has been observed and 41 breast cancers have occurred (19 on tamoxifen vs. 22 on placebo, P = 0.64). However, subgroup analyses indicated a borderline significant reduction of breast cancer among women continuously on estrogen replacement therapy (ERT, mostly transdermal) and receiving tamoxifen, with 8 cases of breast cancer among 390 ERT users on placebo versus 1 case among 362 ERT users on tamoxifen (RR = 0.13, 95% CI = 0.02-1.02). Withdrawal rate (mainly due to menopausal symptoms) differed according to ERT use, with compliance being 78% and 75% at 3 and 5 years, respectively, for women who never took ERT, and 92% and 88% at 3 and 5 years, respectively, for women not on ERT at baseline, but who took ERT at some time during the trial. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (surrogate end point biomarkers) studies showed that a lower dose of tamoxifen (such as 5 mg/day) does not affect the drug's activity on several biomarkers of both cardiovascular and breast cancer risk. We are therefore planning a multicenter placebo-controlled phase III trial in postmenopausal healthy women on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to test whether the combination of HRT and low-dose tamoxifen retains the benefits while reducing the risks of either agent maintaining a high compliance rate.",0
Comparison of antiestrogen and progestogen therapy for initial treatment and consequences of their combination for second-line treatment of recurrent breast cancer.,"A randomized clinical trial involving postmenopausal patients with estrogen receptor positive recurrent breast cancer is reported. Of 168 patients entered, 156 were evaluable, of whom 79 received oral tamoxifen citrate 10 mg twice daily and 77 oral megestrol acetate 40 mg four times a day. Partial response (PR) plus complete response (CR) rates (both arms, 34%) and time-to-disease progression were similar in both arms. Side effects and toxicity were minimal with both regimens, although more patients who received tamoxifen complained of hot flushes (33% v 11%) and more patients who received megestrol acetate had a 10% or greater weight gain at 6 months from baseline (51% v 19%). On progression of disease, 73 patients who had achieved a CR, PR, or stable response received the alternative hormonal treatment in addition to the original hormonal therapy. Ten of 40 patients (25%) who began treatment with megestrol acetate had a further CR or PR; none of 33 patients originally receiving tamoxifen had a response when megestrol acetate was added. Similarly, patients who received tamoxifen as an addition to their original megestrol acetate treatment also had a significantly longer time to second progression than did those in the comparative arm. It was concluded that as initial hormonal therapy for relapsed patients, either tamoxifen or megestrol acetate can be used with confidence. However, it is suggested that tamoxifen and megestrol acetate should not be used in combination, except for those few occasions when tamoxifen is added as second-line therapy following a completed megestrol acetate response, and the megestrol acetate is continued for its palliative effects on appetite and weight gain. Possible mechanisms behind these results are discussed.",1
"Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of IST-622, a novel synthetic derivative of chartreusin, by oral administration in a phase II study of patients with breast cancer.","The aim of this study was to analyze the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of 6- O-(3-ethoxypropionyl)-3',4'- O-exo-benzylidene-chartreusin (IST-622) and its metabolites, and to develop limited sampling models (LSM). Based on the data from 18 patients with breast cancer who were treated orally with 280 or 525 mg/m(2) of IST-622 once daily after breakfast for five consecutive days, we analyzed the relationship between the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) and toxicities using a sigmoid E-max model and logistic regression. Plasma concentrations of IST-622 and its metabolites, 3',4'- O-exo-benzylidene-chartreusin (A-132) and 3""-demethyl-3',4'- O-exo-benzylidene-chartreusin (A-132M), were measured at 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 h after administration on day 1. The AUC was calculated using the trapezoidal method. We also developed a LSM using stepwise linear regression analysis. IST-622 was detected in very few patients, and its concentration was very low and could be disregarded. It was suggested that meals promoted absorption of IST-622. AUCs of A-132 plus A-132M showed a better correlation with the rates of decrease and nadir counts of leukocytes, neutrophils and platelets than the AUC of each metabolite separately. Patients with the sum of AUCs more than 70 microg.h/ml showed severe myelotoxicities. Moreover, logistic regression analysis showed that grade 4 myelotoxicities would be seen in 30% of patients at an AUC of 65 microg.h/ml. We also developed an unbiased and precise LSM: AUC<SUB>0-24h</SUB>=C<SUB>8h</SUB>x17.6-0.95, where C(8h) denotes the sum of plasma concentrations of A-132 and A-132M. Myelotoxicities showed a good correlation with AUC(0-24h), and based on the results, it was decided that the target AUC was 65 microg.h/ml. The LSM was very convenient for estimating AUC(0-24h) and sufficiently accurate. These results show the possibility of predicting toxicities and dose adaptation for interpatient variability using LSM.",1
Excellent outcomes with adjuvant toremifene or tamoxifen in early stage breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Fareston (toremifene) and tamoxifen, both selective estrogen receptor modulators, are therapeutically equivalent treatments for metastatic breast cancer. We hypothesized that toremifene as compared with tamoxifen given as adjuvant therapy for early stage breast cancer would result in equivalent survival with an improved side effect profile, therefore, providing superior therapeutic efficacy. METHODS: The North American Fareston versus Tamoxifen Adjuvant trial assigned 1813 perimenopausal or postmenopausal women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive invasive breast cancer to adjuvant treatment with either tamoxifen or toremifene. The primary outcomes evaluated were disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Median follow-up was 59 months. The baseline characteristics of the 2 treatment groups were well-balanced. On the basis of intent-to-treat, 5-year actuarial DFS was not significantly different between tamoxifen and toremifene (91.2% [standard error of the mean [SE] 1.2%] vs 91.2% [SE 1.1%], respectively). Similarly, 5-year actuarial OS was not significantly different between tamoxifen and toremifene (92.7% [SE 1.1%] vs 93.7% [SE 1.0%], respectively). Controlling for patient age, tumor size, and tumor grade, a Cox multivariate survival analysis found no difference between patients randomized to toremifene versus tamoxifen in terms of OS (OR = 0.951; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.623-1.451, P = .951) or DFS (OR = 1.037; 95% CI, 0.721-1.491, P = .846). Adverse events were similar in the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Women treated with adjuvant hormonal therapy enjoyed excellent DFS and OS. No significant differences were found between treatment with either tamoxifen or toremifene. Treatment of HR-positive patients with either tamoxifen or toremifene is appropriate.",1
Levamisole as an immunoadjuvant: phase I study and application in breast cancer.,"A phase I study of levamisole in patients with cancer was undertaken to determine its therapeutic dose range, side effects, limiting toxicity, and influence on immune function. Simultaneously, a group of patients receiving adjuvant combination chemotherapy for carcinoma of the breast were entered in a randomized study to observe whether levamisole was capable of overcoming the immunodepressive effects of cytotoxic drugs. In the phase I trial the doses used ranged from 65 to 410 mg/m2. The maximum tolerated dose was 358 mg/m2. Side effects were generally low in intensity and related to the gastrointestinal and central nervous systems; the limiting toxic effect was intractable nausea. Significant changes in immune test values were noted in both acute and chronic trials. Alterations in immunoglobulin levels, complemented values, and numbers and types of lymphocytes and mitogenic responses to concanavalin A as well as specific mitogens were observed. In the randomized trial there was no difference between the chemoimmunotherapy and chemotherapy-alone groups.",1
"Phase II trials of Baker's antifol, bleomycin, CCNU, streptozotocin, tilorone, and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine plus arabinosyl cytosine in metastatic breast cancer.","A total of 202 patients with advanced breast cancer were entered into two prospectively randomized Phase II trials conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, in an effort to identify promising agents and combinations for previously treated cases. Patients in Study 1 received bleomycin, CCNU, or streptozotocin and those in Study 2 received tilorone, Baker's antifol, or a combination of 5-fluorodeoxyuridine plus arabinosyl cytosine. Partial responses were seen only with bleomycin, Baker's antifol, and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine plus arabinosyl cytosine. The median times to treatment failure ranged from 3.6 weeks to 5.7 weeks, and the median survival times, from 8 weeks to 25 weeks for tilorone and bleomycin, respectively. Toxic reactions was primarily hematologic and gastrointestinal, but skin, neurologic, respiratory, and renal abnormalities were noted in some treatment arms. The treatment schedules outlined and the toxic effects noted provide background information that might prove useful in designing complex new chemotherapeutic programs, since there is pharmacological rationale for incorporating some of the agents tested into present standard combination chemotherapy regimens.",0
Five versus more than five years of tamoxifen for lymph node-negative breast cancer: updated findings from the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-14 randomized trial.,"BACKGROUND: Previously reported information from B-14, a National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, demonstrated that patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer and negative axillary lymph nodes experienced a prolonged benefit from 5 years of tamoxifen therapy. When these women were rerandomized to receive either placebo or more prolonged tamoxifen therapy, they obtained no additional advantage from tamoxifen through 4 years of follow-up. Because the optimal duration of tamoxifen administration continues to be controversial and because there have been 3 more years of follow-up and a substantial increase in the number of events since our last report, an update of the B-14 study is appropriate. METHODS: Patients (n = 1172) who had completed 5 years of tamoxifen therapy and who were disease free were rerandomized to receive placebo (n = 579) or tamoxifen (n = 593). Survival, disease-free survival (DFS), and relapse-free survival (RFS) were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method; the differences between the treatment groups were assessed by the log-rank test. Relative risks of failure (with 95% confidence intervals) were determined by the Cox proportional hazards model. P values were two-sided. RESULTS: Through 7 years after reassignment of tamoxifen-treated patients to either placebo or continued tamoxifen therapy, a slight advantage was observed in patients who discontinued tamoxifen relative to those who continued to receive it: DFS = 82% versus 78% (P =.03), RFS = 94% versus 92% (P =.13), and survival = 94% versus 91% (P =.07), respectively. The lack of benefit from additional tamoxifen therapy was independent of age or other characteristics. CONCLUSION: Through 7 years of follow-up after rerandomization, there continues to be no additional benefit from tamoxifen administered beyond 5 years in women with ER-positive breast cancer and negative axillary lymph nodes.",1
Effect of oestrogen receptor status and time on the intra-tumoural accumulation of tamoxifen and N-desmethyltamoxifen following short-term therapy in human primary breast cancer.,"While the presence of oestrogen receptors (ERs) in human breast cancer may determine the biological response to tamoxifen, the extent to which ER status governs tumour tamoxifen accumulation is unclear. We investigated the intra-tumoural disposition of tamoxifen (TAM) and its major metabolite N-desmethyltamoxifen (DMT) in 36 human breast carcinomas following short-term therapy. Steady-state serum concentrations appeared to be reached following 2 weeks therapy, after which no significant difference in the intra-tumoural concentrations of TAM between ER-ve and ER+ve tumours was observed (717.9 +/- 166.4 ng/gm, and 518.6 +/- 109.4 ng/gm, respectively). In patients treated for less than 2 weeks, there was significantly less intra-tumoural TAM in ER-ve compared with ER+ve tumours (120.9 +/- 49.9 ng/gm and 450.1 +/- 75.3 ng/gm, respectively; p < 0.04). The rate of tumour TAM accumulation correlated with duration of therapy only for ER-ve tumours (r = 0.72, p < 0.02), whereas for ER+ve tumours the absolute ER value appeared to be weakly associated with TAM accumulation (r = 0.41; p < 0.05). The intra-tumoural ratio of TAM to DMT reflected the serum concentrations in ER-ve tumours, but in ER+ve tumours relatively more TAM to DMT was observed. A similar intracellular distribution of both TAM and DMT was observed, although following 2 weeks therapy relatively less of each compound was found in the cytosol of ER-ve compared with ER+ve tumours (18% vs 34%). These results demonstrate that ER status may influence the rate of accumulation and intra-cellular distribution of tamoxifen and its metabolites, but not the final concentrations which are achieved. Following steady-state, both ER+ve and ER-ve tumours, not all of which would be expected to respond to the drug, achieve intra-tumoural concentrations 5-7 fold greater than serum. Unlike recent reports on acquired resistance, therefore, de novo resistance to tamoxifen is unlikely to represent an inability of the tumour to achieve adequate intra-tumoural concentrations of the drug or its metabolites.",0
"Trait anxiety, symptom perceptions, and illness-related responses among women with breast cancer in remission during a tamoxifen clinical trial.","Postmenopausal women with breast cancer in remission (N = 140) who were participating in a randomized clinical trial of tamoxifen chemoprevention therapy completed measures of trait anxiety, symptoms, cancer worry, and breast self-examinations (BSEs) during the first 6 months of the trial. Trait anxiety was associated with heightened sensitivity to tamoxifen-induced symptoms (but not with tendencies to report increases in symptoms unrelated to tamoxifen use), greater tendencies to attribute symptoms to tamoxifen use, and greater cancer worry. Tamoxifen use increased BSE rates among high-anxiety participants. For low-anxiety participants, tamoxifen use increased cancer worry but not BSE rates. Trait anxiety appears to be associated with vigilant activation of illness-related representations that trigger attentiveness to sensations, worry, and protective coping in response to somatic cues.",0
The effect of modafinil on cognitive function in breast cancer survivors.,"BACKGROUND: The authors conducted a randomized clinical trial examining the effects of modafinil in reducing persistent fatigue in patients after treatment for cancer and performed secondary analyses to assess the effect of modafinil on cognitive function.METHODS: Breast cancer patients who reported a score of >or=2 on the Brief Fatigue Inventory were enrolled in the study. In phase 1 (P1), patients received 200 mg modafinil open-label once daily for 4 weeks. In phase 2 (P2), patients with a positive response after P1 were randomized either to an additional 4 weeks of modafinil or to placebo. Tests of memory and attention selected from the Cognitive Drug Research (CDR) computerized cognitive assessment were performed at baseline (before modafinil) and after completing phases 1 and 2. The paired differences for each test score were subjected to a Wilcoxon signed rank test.RESULTS: Of the 82 women who were enrolled, 76 completed P1, and 68 completed all assessments in the study. Modafinil had a significant effect on the Speed of Memory (P = .0073) and Quality of Episodic Memory (P < .0001) during P1 of the study. After randomization at Week 8, those patients who continued modafinil demonstrated significantly greater improvement in Speed of Memory (P = .029), Quality of Episodic Memory (P = .0151), and mean Continuity of Attention (P = .0101) relative to the group that was switched to placebo.CONCLUSIONS: The authors found that modafinil improved cognitive performance in breast cancer survivors by enhancing some memory and attention skills. Although confirmation is needed, these findings suggest that modafinil may enhance quality of life in this patient population.",0
Does subjective burden of early breast cancer and its treatment affect immune measures during adjuvant therapy?,"Psychosocial factors have been described as affecting cellular immune measures in healthy subjects. In patients with early breast cancer we explored bi-directional psycho-immune effects to determine whether subjective burden has an impact on immune measures, and vice versa. Patients (n = 239) operated for early breast cancer and randomized into International Breast Cancer Study Group (IBCSG) adjuvant clinical trials were assessed immediately before the beginning of adjuvant treatment (baseline) and 3 and 6 months thereafter, at the beginning of the corresponding treatment cycle. Cellular immune measures (leukocytes, lymphocytes, lymphocyte subset counts), markers of activation of the cellular immune system (beta2-microglobulin, soluble interleukin-2 receptor serum levels), and self-report subjective burden (global indicators of physical well-being, mood, coping effort) were assessed concurrently. The relationship between subjective burden and gradients of immune measures was investigated with regression analyses controlling for adjuvant treatment. There was a pattern of small negative associations between all variables assessing subjective burden before the beginning of adjuvant therapy with the gradients of the markers of activation of the cellular immune system and NK cell counts. In particular, better mood predicted a decline in the course of beta2-microglobulin and IL-2r at months 3 and 6. The gradient of beta2-microglobulin was associated with mood and coping effort at month 3. However, the effect sizes were very small. In conclusion, in this explorative investigation, there was an indication for subjective burden affecting and being affected by markers of activation of the cellular immune system during the first 3 and 6 months of adjuvant therapy. The question of clinical significance remains unanswered. These associations have to be investigated with refined assessment tools and schedules.",0
European early phase II dose-finding study of droloxifene in advanced breast cancer.,"Preliminary results from clinical phase II studies with droloxifene demonstrated efficacy and good tolerability. One hundred ninety-six female, postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer were treated with 20, 40, or 100 mg of droloxifene daily. Exclusion criteria were as follows: negative ER/PR status, tamoxifen treatment within the preceding three months, chemotherapy within the preceding three weeks, and performance grade of four. Seventeen percent of the patients treated with 20 mg daily responded to treatment, exhibiting complete or partial responses according to World Health Organization criteria. In the 40-mg group, 30% responded and in the 100-mg group, 31% responded. Adverse symptoms generally were mild.",1
Chemotherapy of advanced breast cancer: a controlled randomized trial of cyclophosphamide versus a four-drug combination.,"Ninety-nine patients with advanced breast cancer were randomized to receive either cyclophosphamide continuously or a combination of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil and vinblastine given intermittently. The number and duration of objective responses were greater in patients receiving the combination but the differences between the two treatments did not achieve formal significance. The combination was logistically easier to manage and produced less toxicity.",1

Biological response modifiers of cancer-related neuroendocrine disorders: efficacy of the long-term dopaminergic agonist cabergoline in the treatment of breast cancer-induced hyperprolactinemia.,"The evaluation of the biological status of cancer patients should not be limited only to investigation of immune reactivity, but should also include analysis of the endocrine condition, namely concerning those hormones which have appeared to be tumor growth factors, such as prolactin (PRL) for breast and prostate carcinomas. This statement is justified by the fact that the evidence of abnormally high serum concentrations of PRL has been proven to be associated with poor prognosis in breast and prostate cancer patients. Moreover, since hyperprolactinemia negatively influences the efficacy of anticancer therapies in breast cancer, it could be fundamental to achieve a normalization of PRL levels by long-acting dopaminergic agents, such as cabergoline. On this basis, a study was planned to evaluate the effect of cabergoline on PRL levels in hyperprolactinemic metastatic breast cancer subjects. The study included 20 hyperprolactinemic metastatic breast cancer subjects, who were randomized to receive no therapy or cabergoline at 0.5 mg/week orally for 4 consecutive weeks. Cabergoline therapy induced a normalization in all patients, whereas no spontaneous normalization of PRL levels occured in the control group. These results show that a weekly oral administration of the long-acting dopaminergic agent cabergoline is a well tolerated and effective treatment of metastatic breast cancer-related hyperprolactinemia. The possible prognostic impact of PRL normalization needs to be established by successive studies.",0
Effect of fenretinide on bone mineral density and metabolism in women with early breast cancer.,"Prolonged administration of natural or synthetic retinoids has been associated with significant skeletal abnormalities, including osteoporosis. We studied the effects of the synthetic retinoid fenretinide (N-4-hydroxyphenylretinamide, or 4-HPR) administered for a mean of 40 months on bone mineral density and metabolism in 66 consecutive women with early breast cancer belonging to a secondary prevention trial. The mean (+/-SD) bone mineral density at the distal and ultradistal forearm were, respectively, 0.61+/-0.08 and 0.30+/-0.05 g/cm2 in 33 treated women and 0.62+/-0.07 and 0.29+/-0.07 g/cm2 in 33 control women (p = ns for both). Also, no significant difference was observed in markers of bone formation such as bone alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, nor in urinary bone resorption markers such as calcium, hydroxyproline, and type I bone collagen cross-linked N-telopeptide (NTx). However, a border-line higher excretion of urinary calcium and NTx was found in the 4-HPR group after adjustment for menopausal status. We conclude that prolonged administration of 4-HPR is not associated with significant alterations of bone mineral density of the forearm. However, a trend towards an increase in bone resorption markers suggests the need for further assessment at different skeletal sites.",0
An evaluation of two schedules of VP-16 and adriamycin in patients with advanced breast cancer.,"A phase II study utilizing VP-16 and adriamycin in a randomized fashion tested the concept of synchronization of the drugs in treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Although there was a trend in median survival following the synchronized schedule, there was no significant difference in survival or progression-free intervals. The concept of synchronization was not established.",1
Eribulin monotherapy versus treatment of physician's choice in patients with metastatic breast cancer (EMBRACE): a phase 3 open-label randomised study.,"BACKGROUND: Treatments with survival benefit are greatly needed for women with heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer. Eribulin mesilate is a non-taxane microtubule dynamics inhibitor with a novel mode of action. We aimed to compare overall survival of heavily pretreated patients receiving eribulin versus currently available treatments.METHODS: In this phase 3 open-label study, women with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer were randomly allocated (2:1) to eribulin mesilate (1·4 mg/m(2) administered intravenously during 2-5 min on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle) or treatment of physician's choice (TPC). Patients had received between two and five previous chemotherapy regimens (two or more for advanced disease), including an anthracycline and a taxane, unless contraindicated. Randomisation was stratified by geographical region, previous capecitabine treatment, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status. Patients and investigators were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00388726.FINDINGS: 762 women were randomly allocated to treatment groups (508 eribulin, 254 TPC). Overall survival was significantly improved in women assigned to eribulin (median 13·1 months, 95% CI 11·8-14·3) compared with TPC (10·6 months, 9·3-12·5; hazard ratio 0·81, 95% CI 0·66-0·99; p=0·041). The most common adverse events in both groups were asthenia or fatigue (270 [54%] of 503 patients on eribulin and 98 [40%] of 247 patients on TPC at all grades) and neutropenia (260 [52%] patients receiving eribulin and 73 [30%] of those on TPC at all grades). Peripheral neuropathy was the most common adverse event leading to discontinuation from eribulin, occurring in 24 (5%) of 503 patients.INTERPRETATION: Eribulin showed a significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival compared with TPC in women with heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer. This finding challenges the notion that improved overall survival is an unrealistic expectation during evaluation of new anticancer therapies in the refractory setting.FUNDING: Eisai.",0

Fatigue and quality of life outcomes of exercise during cancer treatment.,"PURPOSE: Despite the recognition of fatigue as a common and distressing symptom during cancer treatment, there are few evidence-based interventions available to manage such fatigue. The purpose of this multi-institutional pilot study was to explore the effects of a home-based moderate walking exercise intervention on fatigue, physical functioning, emotional distress, and quality of life (QOL) during breast cancer treatment. DESCRIPTION OF STUDY: Fifty-two women were recruited from five university hospital outpatient departments for this pilot study with an experimental design. Subjects were randomly assigned to the walking program or to usual care during adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy for breast cancer. Symptoms, physical functioning, and QOL were measured at baseline, midtreatment, and at the end of treatment. RESULTS: Women who exercised at least 90 minutes per week on 3 or more days reported significantly less fatigue and emotional distress as well as higher functional ability and QOL than women who were less active during treatment. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: A home-based walking exercise program is a potentially effective, low-cost, and safe intervention to manage fatigue and to improve QOL during adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy for breast cancer. This health-promoting self-care activity needs further testing in large randomized clinical trials.",0
Influence of Ukrain on patients with surgically treated breast cancer (introductory remarks).,Studies were undertaken to evaluate the influence of Ukrain on the postoperative period in patients with breast cancer. The group under Ukrain medication was comprised of 10 patients in stage T1-3NO-1MO. The control group was comprised of 22 patients in the same clinical and laboratory staging as those treated with Ukrain in the first year of postoperative follow-up metastatic lymph nodes were observed in one patient from the control group. It is planned to enlarge the groups and to continue the observation up to the third year to obtain reliable and more statistically significant data.,0
Amino acids and their derivatives in tumour tissue from patients with breast cancer treated with Ukrain. Part VI.,"The present study was undertaken to evaluate the influence of Ukrain on the amino acids pool and their derivatives in tumour tissue of ten patients with breast cancer, treated in the preoperative phase with Ukrain. The control group consisted of five patients of similar age and advancement of the disease, who did not receive Ukrain. The data obtained indicate that Ukrain influences cancerous tissue, as demonstrated at the level of amino acids. The most characteristic changes observed in cancerous tissue after treatment with Ukrain were increases in the levels of proline, taurine and glutamic acid.",0
Randomized trial of 3-hour versus 24-hour infusion of high-dose paclitaxel in patients with metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer: National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project Protocol B-26.,"PURPOSE: Paclitaxel is an active drug for the treatment of breast cancer; however, the appropriate duration of administration is unknown. We assessed and compared the response rate, event-free survival, survival, and toxicity of paclitaxel 250 mg/m(2) delivered every 3 weeks as a 3-hour or 24-hour infusion. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 563 women with stage IV or IIIB breast cancer were randomized into one of two groups: 279 received 3-hour paclitaxel and 284 received 24-hour paclitaxel. Patients were stratified by age, stage of disease, and prior therapy. RESULTS: A significantly higher rate of tumor response occurred in the first four cycles of therapy in patients who received the 24-hour infusion of paclitaxel (51% v 41%, respectively; P =.025). Tumor response over all cycles was also significantly higher in the group that received 24-hour infusion (54% v 44%, respectively; P =.023). There were no significant differences in event-free survival or survival between the two arms of the study (P =.9 and.8, respectively). No treatment by stage or by age interactions were observed. During the first four cycles of therapy, at least one episode of >/= grade 3 toxicity (excluding nadir hematologic values, alopecia, and weight change) occurred in 45% of patients who received the 3-hour paclitaxel infusion and in 50% of those who received the 24-hour paclitaxel infusion. Febrile neutropenia, >/= grade 3 infection, and >/= grade 3 stomatitis were less frequent, and severe neurosensory toxicity was more frequent in those who received the 3-hour paclitaxel infusion. Ten treatment-related deaths occurred in the first four cycles. Age, stage, and prior chemotherapy did not influence the effect of treatment. CONCLUSION: When administered as a continuous 24-hour infusion, high-dose paclitaxel results in a higher tumor response rate than when administered as a 3-hour infusion but does not significantly improve event-free survival or survival. Paclitaxel as a 24-hour infusion results in increased hematologic toxicity and decreased neurosensory toxicity.",1
Conventional versus high-dose epidoxorubicin as single agent in advanced breast cancer.,"Between March 1986 and December 1987, two groups of consecutive patients with advanced breast cancer underwent epidoxorubicin (Epidx) monochemotherapy. Twenty-three patients (group A) received Epidx at a dose of 60 mg/m2 and 27 (group B) at a dose of 120 mg/m2 (i.v. every 3 weeks). No patient had undergone anthracycline treatment before entering the study. Age ranged from 39 to 70 years (mean 52) in group A and from 35 to 69 (mean 50 in group B). The main sites of involvement were liver (5 patients in group A and 10 in group B), lung (4 and 5 patients, respectively), bone (7 and 8 patients, respectively), and soft tissue (6 and 5 patients, respectively). The number of courses of therapy ranged from 4 to 10 (mean 7.4) in group A and from 3 to 10 (mean 6.6) in group B. Tumor response and toxic effects were graded according to World Health Organization criteria. CR + PR were 35% in group A and 67% in group B (chi square = 3.862, p < 0.05). Results were analyzed at 130 weeks from the beginning of the therapy. At this time, survival was 9% in group A and 15% in group B, with a median survival time of 61 weeks (range 18-130) and 77 weeks (range 24-130), respectively. No patient in group A showed cardiac toxicity higher than grade 2 during or after the treatment, whereas in group B, 2 patients developed congestive heart failure after a cumulative Epidx dose of 1080 and 1200 mg/m2. Treatment delays, to allow recovery of white blood cells, were infrequent and occurred only in patients previously subjected to chemotherapy. No patient required hospitalization for sepsis, and alopecia was reversible in all patients. Our data demonstrate that there is a relationship between Epidx dose and response rate in advanced breast cancer.",1
Nausea at the end of adjuvant cancer treatment in relation to exercise during treatment in patients with breast cancer.,"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relationship between nausea and exercise during and after adjuvant cancer treatment (chemotherapy and radiation therapy or chemotherapy alone). DESIGN: Secondary data analysis from a longitudinal, single-blinded, three-arm, randomized controlled trial. The trial failed to show a significant effect of an exercise intervention on nausea control (by intent to treat analysis); therefore, patients were analyzed together to evaluate the relationship between nausea and actual exercise behavior. SETTING: Outpatient cancer treatment clinics. SAMPLE: 112 female patients with breast cancer who were receiving adjuvant cancer treatment. METHODS: Actual exercise behavior-based analysis was conducted with nausea intensity and the participant's exercise status measured three times during and after adjuvant cancer treatment. Participants were considered exercisers if actual exercise behaviors corresponded to the recommendation of the American College of Sports Medicine: aerobic exercise at a minimum of moderate intensity, 20 minutes per session, and three times per week. Mann-Whitney U tests evaluated the difference in nausea intensity depending on actual exercise status. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Nausea intensity and exercise status. FINDINGS: Exercisers experienced significantly less intense nausea than nonexercisers at the completion of adjuvant cancer treatment. CONCLUSIONS: A moderate level of aerobic exercise is related to less intense nausea at the completion of adjuvant cancer treatment. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: A moderate level of aerobic exercise is recommended during adjuvant cancer treatment because of the possibility of reducing nausea intensity as well as alleviating other symptoms from adjuvant cancer treatment.",0
Zoledronic acid prevents cancer treatment-induced bone loss in premenopausal women receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy for hormone-responsive breast cancer: a report from the Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group.,"PURPOSE: Adjuvant therapy for breast cancer can be associated with decreased bone mineral density (BMD) that may lead to skeletal morbidity. This study examined whether zoledronic acid can prevent bone loss associated with adjuvant endocrine therapy in premenopausal patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study is a randomized, open-label, phase III, four-arm trial comparing tamoxifen (20 mg/d orally) and goserelin (3.6 mg every 28 days subcutaneously) +/- zoledronic acid (4 mg intravenously every 6 months) versus anastrozole (1 mg/d orally) and goserelin +/- zoledronic acid for 3 years in premenopausal women with hormone-responsive breast cancer. In a BMD subprotocol at three trial centers, patients underwent serial BMD measurements at 0, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. RESULTS: Four hundred one patients were included in the BMD subprotocol. Endocrine treatment without zoledronic acid led to significant (P < .001) overall bone loss after 3 years of treatment (BMD, -14.4% after 36 months; mean T score reduction, -1.4). Overall bone loss was significantly more severe in patients receiving anastrozole/goserelin (BMD, -17.3%; mean T score reduction, -2.6) compared with patients receiving tamoxifen/goserelin (BMD, -11.6%; mean T score reduction, -1.1). In contrast, BMD remained stable in zoledronic acid-treated patients (P < .0001 compared with endocrine therapy alone). No interactions with age or other risk factors were noted. CONCLUSION: Endocrine therapy caused significant bone loss that increased with treatment duration in premenopausal women with breast cancer. Zoledronic acid 4 mg every 6 months effectively inhibited bone loss. Regular BMD measurements and initiation of concomitant bisphosphonate therapy on evidence of bone loss should be considered for patients undergoing endocrine therapy.",0
Integrated analysis of zoledronic acid for prevention of aromatase inhibitor-associated bone loss in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer receiving adjuvant letrozole.,"BACKGROUND: The interim (12-month) results of two similarly designed, ongoing studies (the Zometa-Femara Adjuvant Synergy Trials [Z-FAST and ZO-FAST]) suggest that zoledronic acid (4 mg intravenously every 6 months) when initiated with adjuvant letrozole increases bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine (LS) in postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer compared with patients who receive zoledronic acid only when bone loss became clinically significant or a fragility fracture occurred. METHODS: An integrated analysis was performed to maximize the value of the large pool of data from the two studies in answering clinically relevant questions. The primary objective was to compare the change in LS BMD at month 12. Secondary objectives included comparing (a) the change in total hip (TH) BMD, (b) changes in bone turnover marker concentrations, (c) time to disease recurrence, and (d) safety at month 12. FINDINGS: The integrated analysis included 1,667 patients. At month 12, LS BMD was 5.2% higher in the upfront group than in the delayed group; TH BMD was 3.5% higher. N-telopeptide and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase concentrations decreased by 21.3% and 12.8% in the upfront group and increased by 21.7% and 24.9% in the delayed group, respectively (p < .0001 for intergroup comparisons). Fewer patients receiving upfront zoledronic acid experienced disease recurrence than patients in the delayed group-seven patients (0.84%) versus 17 patients (1.9%) (p = .0401). Fracture rates were similar. No confirmed osteonecrosis of the jaw was reported. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this analysis strengthen the statistical validity of the preliminary results of the Z-FAST and ZO-FAST studies, showing that upfront zoledronic acid prevents aromatase inhibitor-associated bone loss more effectively than delayed-start zoledronic acid in postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer receiving letrozole. Additionally, disease recurrence appears to be lower with upfront zoledronic acid, but further follow-up is needed to confirm these interim results.",0
Multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of epirubicin at four different dose levels: studies in patients with metastatic breast cancer.,"Pharmacokinetic analysis of epirubicin and its metabolites epirubicinol and 7-deoxy-13-dihydro-epirubicinol aglycone during the first and the fourth courses of treatment was performed in 78 patients with metastatic breast cancer. The patients were treated every 3 weeks with epirubicin given as 10-min i.v. infusions at four different dose levels: 40, 60, 90 and 135 mg/m2. In most cases (76 of 78 cases), plasma concentration-time curves fitted to a three-compartmental pharmacokinetic model. The terminal half-life of epirubicin was independent of dose and duration of treatment. Large interindividual differences were demonstrated (mean t1/2 gamma, 21.6 +/- 7.9 h; range, 10.6-69 h; n = 110). In two subjects, extremely long half-lives and high serum bilirubin concentrations indicated impaired liver function. No correlation was found between the half-life and levels of liver alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) or serum creatinine. The metabolite epirubicinol appeared quickly after epirubicin administration and its half-lives were shorter than that of the parent compound (mean t1/2 gamma, 18.1 +/- 4.8 h; range, 8.2-38.4 h; n = 105). Formation of the aglycone metabolite was delayed and the half-life of this metabolite was shorter than that of epirubicin (mean t1/2 gamma, 13 +/- 4.6 h; range, 2.7-29 h; n = 104). The AUC of epirubicin and the total AUC (drug and metabolites) were linearly proportional to the dose, with the former value constituting two-thirds of the latter. A correlation was found between AUC and the plasma concentration of epirubicin at two time points (2 and 24 h after administration). The proposed model was AUC = 9.44 x c2 + 62.5 x c24 + 157.7 (r = 0.953).",1
Sleep quality after initial chemotherapy for breast cancer.,"GOALS OF WORK: The goal of this study is to characterize sleep quality and quantity prior to and in the first three nights after initial chemotherapy for breast cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study makes use of secondary analysis of data from two separate randomized clinical trials (RCT) of behavioral interventions to improve fatigue and sleep. Patients came from two comprehensive cancer centers, three clinical cancer centers, and 10 community clinics in five states. Participants were women with stage I-IIIA breast cancer treated with anthracycline and/or cyclophosphamide-based regimens.MAIN RESULTS: Baseline data from each RCT were used in the analysis. Sixty-five percent of women self-reported poor sleep in the month preceding chemotherapy using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score >5. Three nights of actigraphy data indicated a wide range of sleep experience with an average of 10 awakenings and time (minutes) awake after sleep onset (WASO-M) averaging 61 min per night. The first night's sleep was the worst. There was no statistically significant relationship between self-reported poor sleep and sleep measures obtained by actigraphy. Women with poor sleep at baseline (global PSQI >5) had significantly lower (p < 0.001) physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) health status. However, neither the PCS nor MCS was associated with any of the average actigraphy sleep parameters or night 1 parameters in the aggregated sample. Increasing age was also associated with poorer sleep.CONCLUSIONS: A high percent of women with breast cancer begin chemotherapy with disturbed sleep and the initial nights after chemotherapy are characterized by sleep fragmentation that disrupts sleep maintenance. Interventions should focus on strategies to decrease the number and duration of night awakenings. Further research is needed to identify predictors of poor sleep during this time.",0

Combination therapy of hormone and cytotoxic agents in advanced breast cancer.,"The effectiveness of combination therapy with diethylstilbestrol, cyclophosphamide, and 5-fluorouracil (DES + CTx + FU) was compared with DES alone or CTx + FU in 87 postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer. Therapy was randomized according to the tumor estrogen-receptor (ER) status. In 30 patients with ER-rich tumors and 35 patients with ER-unknown tumors, combination therapy yielded a higher response rate than DES therapy (87% vs. 64% and 59% vs. 23%, respectively). The pooled data from these two groups of patients suggest that the improved response rate from DES + CTx + FU against DES becomes more apparent in patients with visceral involvement (89% vs. 47%) (P less than 0.025) and that patients treated initially with combination therapy (DES + CTx + FU) appeared to have a longer survival than those treated with sequential therapy (DES leads to CTx + FU) (P = 0.06). The survival data in 22 patients with receptor-poor tumors were significantly inferior to those with receptor-rich tumors (P = 0.001). The ER status and presence of visceral metastases are significant factors in the selection of treatment programs.",1
An open randomised trial of second-line endocrine therapy in advanced breast cancer. comparison of the aromatase inhibitors letrozole and anastrozole.,"It was previously shown that letrozole (Femara) was significantly more potent than anastrozole (Arimidex) in inhibiting aromatase activity in vitro and in inhibiting total body aromatisation in patients with breast cancer. The objective of this study was to compare letrozole (2.5 mg per day) and anastrozole (1 mg per day) as endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer previously treated with an anti-oestrogen. This randomised, multicentre and multinational open-label phase IIIb/IV study enrolled 713 patients. Treatment was for advanced breast cancer that had progressed either during anti-oestrogen therapy or within 12 months of completing that therapy. Patients had tumours that were either positive for oestrogen and/or progesterone receptors (48%) or of unknown receptor status (52%). The primary efficacy endpoint was time to progression (TTP). Secondary endpoints included objective response, duration of response, rate and duration of overall clinical benefit (responses and long-term stable disease), time to treatment failure, and overall survival, as well as general safety. There was no difference between the treatment arms in TTP; median times were the same for both treatments. Letrozole was significantly superior to anastrozole in the overall response rate (ORR) (19.1% versus 12.3%, P=0.013), including in predefined subgroups (receptor status-unknown, and soft-tissue- and viscera-dominant site of disease). There were no significant differences between the treatment arms in the rate of clinical benefit, median duration of response, duration of clinical benefit, time to treatment failure or overall survival. Both agents were well tolerated and there were no significant differences in safety. These results support previous data documenting the greater aromatase-inhibiting activity of letrozole and indicate that advanced breast cancer is more responsive to letrozole than to anastrozole as second-line endocrine therapy.",1
Phase II evaluation of hexamethylmelamine in advanced breast cancer: a Southwest Oncology Group study.,"Ninety-eight patients with metastatic breast cancer, heavily pretreated with other agents, were entered in a phase II trial of hexamethylmelamine (HEX). Patients were randomized to receive HEX alone or combined with prophylactic pyridoxine. There was a 2% response rate in 89 partially or fully evaluable patients. Seven percent of these patients developed neurologic toxicity which occurred in the HEX-alone group only.",1
Hormonal treatment for metastatic breast cancer. An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Phase III trial comparing aminoglutethimide to tamoxifen.,"BACKGROUND: Tamoxifen and aminoglutethimide are two hormone therapies reported to be effective palliative approaches for patients with metastatic breast cancer. The current trial was designed to evaluate their relative therapeutic effectiveness. METHODS: Two hundred forty-nine postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer were randomized in an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Phase III study to treatment with adrenalectomy, aminoglutethimide, or tamoxifen with crossover to alternate therapy if disease progressed. Adrenalectomy was dropped as a treatment after 2 years because of low patient accrual. RESULTS: There were 216 evaluable patients entered in the study with 108 initially randomized to aminoglutethimide and 108 to receive tamoxifen therapy. The overall response rate for aminoglutethimide was 45%, and for tamoxifen it was 27%. One institution had a response rate of 60% with aminoglutethimide and only 4% with tamoxifen, whereas all of the other institutions combined had a response rate of 41% with aminoglutethimide and 34% with tamoxifen. Eighty-seven evaluable patients crossed over to the other drug (44 to aminoglutethimide and 43 to tamoxifen). There was a 36% response rate to aminoglutethimide and 19% to tamoxifen, with stable disease in 36% of both groups. The overall survival rates were identical. Toxicity was greater with aminoglutethimide (dermatitis) but was not life-threatening. Glucocorticoid support with either dexamethasone or hydrocortisone was acceptable. CONCLUSIONS: Both aminoglutethimide and tamoxifen produced responses in postmenopausal patients with breast cancer, and a significant number of crossover responses were observed. Of interest in this randomized study was the observation that one institution had a markedly different response rate on induction, reinforcing the need for multi-institution trials in Phase III studies.",1
Rationale and overview of the Raloxifene Use for the Heart (RUTH) trial.,"Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that has beneficial effects on several cardiovascular risk factors and has also been associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer in osteoporosis prevention trials. The Raloxifene Use for the Heart (RUTH) study was designed to test the hypothesis that, compared to placebo, raloxifene at 60 mg/day (1) lowers the risk of the combined end point of coronary death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), and hospitalized acute coronary syndromes other than MI and (2) reduces the risk of invasive breast cancer (coprimary end point) in women at high risk for major coronary events based on established cardiovascular disease (CVD) or multiple risk factors. RUTH is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, clinical trial of 10,101 women aged 55 years or older from 26 countries and is expected to be completed in approximately 5 years.",0
Anxiety levels in patients randomized to adjuvant therapy versus observation for early breast cancer.,"We studied anxiety levels in 68 patients who had been randomized to adjuvant chemotherapy v observation on two Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) protocols. All subjects were women who had undergone total or modified radical mastectomy for breast cancer. Immediately before breast protocol randomization and again 3, 6, and 12 months later, patients completed two self-report measures: the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the SCL-90. There were no consistent trends in anxiety levels over time. At each test point, patients under observation displayed higher anxiety scores than did patients receiving adjuvant therapy, but these differences failed to attain statistical significance. Power calculations indicate that these results rule out the possibility of major differences in anxiety levels among patients randomized to observation v adjuvant therapy, but a larger patient sample is required before a definitive statement can be made about smaller differences.",0
Crossover trial for lipid abnormality in postmenopausal breast cancer patients during selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) administrations.,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the different profiles of serum lipids resulting from the administration of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). Postmenopausal primary breast cancer patients (n = 197) with node-negative, hormone receptor-positive who were treated at our department or in other related medical institutions from April 1997 through March 2001 were given adjuvant therapy. The adjuvant therapy included 1 year's administration of tamoxifen (TAM) 20 mg or toremifene (TOR) 40 mg. The profiles of serum lipids such as total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) and triglyceride (TG) were observed. After 1 year administration TC had significantly decreased (p < 0.001) both in the TAM group and the TOR group, but no significant difference was found between these groups (p = 0.249). HDL had significantly decreased in the TAM group (p < 0.001), while it had significantly increased in the TOR group (p < 0.001), and a significant difference was found between the groups (p < 0.001). TG had significantly increased in the TAM group (p < 0.001) but significantly decreased in the TOR group (p < 0.001). The medication was switched in those who still had abnormal lipid metabolism and given to them for another year. After 1 year from the crossover TC and HDL had increased to the levels of before administration (p < 0.001) and TG had decreased in those (n = 57) whose medication was switched from TAM to TOR. While TC had decreased and TG had increased in those (n = 23) whose medication was switched from TOR to TAM (p < 0.001). The above findings have suggested that TOR provides better profiles of lipid metabolism than TAM.",0
Is p53 a protein that predicts the response to chemotherapy in node negative breast cancer?,"The role of p53 in modulating apoptosis has suggested that it may affect efficacy of anti cancer agents. For this reason, we have evaluated p53 alterations in 282 consecutive patients with infiltrating node-negative breast cancer who underwent primary surgery and were randomized either to CMF (Cyclophosphamide 400 mg/m2, Fluorouracil 400 mg/m2, and Methotrexate 40 mg/m2) or control arm (no adjuvant therapy) from 1980 to 1989. p53 alterations were analyzed by immunohistochemistry using DO7 MoAb, revealed by immunoperoxidase technique, and quantitated in term of percentage of positive cells. We observed a positive staining in 24% of the tumors. Among them, 10% had a positive staining in more than 75% of the cells. There was a highly significant association between the proportion of positive cells and histologic grade of the infiltrating ductal carcinomas (p<0.004). However, there was no association with age, tumor size, hormone receptor content, or vascular embolism. There was a trend but no significant relationship between positive staining and overall survival either in each arm of the trial or in the overall population. Interestingly, we observed a higher relative risk of local relapse after conservative therapy in the boosted area in the group of mutated p53 (RR=4.41; p<0.0005). We conclude that, in this node-negative breast tumor population, alteration of p53 cannot predict the response to the chemotherapy. However, it may represent a useful marker of risk of local relapse and of radio resistance.",0
Influence of Ukrain on patients with surgically treated breast cancer. Part III. The immune system.,"The present study was undertaken to evaluate the influence of Ukrain on immune parameters in ten patients with breast cancer, treated with the drug in the preoperative phase. The control group consisted of eight patients of similar age and advancement of the disease, who did not receive Ukrain before mastectomy. The data were compared with the parameters obtained in 15 healthy blood donors. It was found that treatment with Ukrain distinctly regulates cellular and, slightly, humoral immunity, non-specific immunity and also complement activity.",0
Hemoglobin and aerobic fitness changes with supervised exercise training in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.,"BACKGROUND: Aerobic exercise training (AET) is known to increase RBC production; however, this has not been evaluated in breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy. The purpose of this study was to examine the changes in hemoglobin (Hb) levels in the Supervised Trial of Aerobic versus Resistance Training (START) and to determine its association with changes in VO(2peak).METHODS: Two hundred and forty-two breast cancer patients initiating chemotherapy were randomized to usual care (n = 82), resistance exercise (RET, n = 82), or AET (n = 78) groups for the duration of their chemotherapy (median, 17 weeks). Supervised exercise was thrice weekly based on standard AET and RET prescriptions. Aerobic fitness (VO(2peak)) and Hb concentration were measured at baseline and end of chemotherapy.RESULTS: Regardless of the exercise group, Hb declined over the course of chemotherapy (13.4 ± 10.0 to 11.8 ± 11.5 g/dL, P < 0.01). Both AET and RET groups had significant, moderate correlations between the change in VO(2peak) and Hb (AET: r = 0.49, P < 0.001; RET: r = 0.39, P = 0.001).CONCLUSION: The results indicate that regular exercise does not protect against the decline in Hb associated with chemotherapy in breast cancer patients, but resulted in a stronger association between Hb and VO(2peak).IMPACT: Even with the chemotherapy-induced decline in Hb, breast cancer patients can maintain their aerobic capacity by participating in regular aerobic exercise. Further studies are required to determine safe intensity levels that may stimulate the maintenance of Hb levels in breast cancer patients.",0
Changes in bone turnover and in bone mass in women with breast cancer switched from tamoxifen to exemestane.,"Recently the third generation aromatase inhibitors have proved their efficacy and tolerability compared with tamoxifen in the adjuvant treatment of women with hormone responsive early breast cancer. However, there is some concern about the possible negative impact of these drugs on bone. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of the steroidal aromatase inactivator exemestane on bone turnover markers and on bone mineral density (BMD). Seventy postmenopausal women (62.0+/-8.9 years) with completely resected breast cancer and who were disease-free following 2-3 years on tamoxifen were randomly assigned to continue tamoxifen (n=36) or switch to exemestane (n=34). Sixty-one patients completed the 2-year study period. Bone alkaline phosphatase (B-ALP) and the carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) were measured at baseline and after 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months. BMD at lumbar spine (BMD-LS), at femoral neck (BMD-FN), at total hip (BMD-T) and at whole body (BMD-WB) were measured at 6-monthly intervals. Exemestane-treated women showed significant (p<0.01) increases with respect to baseline in both B-ALP and CTX. The difference between the 2 groups reached the statistical significance at month 6 for CTX (p<0.05) and at month 9 for B-ALP (p<0.01). Moreover, the exemestane-treated women showed an early decrease in PTH serum levels (-20.4%, p<0.01 at month 6). In the E group, the percentage changes were -2.37 (p<0.05) BMD-LS, -1.24 (p<0.05) BMD-FN, -1.1 (n.s.) BMD-T, -1.03 (n.s.) BMD-WB at month 12 and -2.99 (p<0.01) BMD-LS, -1.92 (p<0.01) BMD-FN, -2.01 (p<0.05) BMD-T, -1.3 (n.s.) BMD-WB at month 24. The tamoxifen group did not show significant changes in BMD. The differences between the two groups were significant at all skeletal sites except BMD-WB. Our data suggest that switching postmenopausal women from tamoxifen to exemestane causes a marked increase in bone turnover markers with a consequent reduction in BMD. These findings could be due to both the direct effect of exemestane and to the loss of the protective effect of tamoxifen. Therefore, the postmenopausal women switched from tamoxifen to exemestane should be monitored for bone loss especially if other risk factors for osteoporosis are present.",0
Intensive dose-dense compared with high-dose adjuvant chemotherapy for high-risk operable breast cancer: Southwest Oncology Group/Intergroup study 9623.,"PURPOSE: Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG)/Intergroup study 9623 was undertaken to compare treatment with an anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy regimen followed by high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) with autologous hematopoietic progenitor cell support (AHPCS) with a modern dose-dense dose-escalated (nonstandard) regimen including both an anthracycline and a taxane. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Participants in this phase III randomized study had operable breast cancer involving four or more axillary lymph nodes and had completed mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery. Patients were randomly assigned to receive four cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by HDC with AHPCS or to receive sequential dose-dense and dose-escalated chemotherapy with doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and cyclophosphamide. The primary end point of this study was disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS: Among 536 eligible patients, there was no significant difference between the two arms for DFS or overall survival (OS). Estimated five-year DFS was 80% (95% CI, 76% to 85%) for dose-dense therapy and 75% (95% CI, 69% to 80%) for transplantation. Estimated 5-year OS was 88% (95% CI, 84% to 92%) for dose-dense therapy and 84% (95% CI, 79% to 88%) for transplantation. CONCLUSION: There is no evidence that transplantation was superior to dose-dense dose-escalated therapy. Transplantation was associated with an increase in toxicity and a possibly inferior outcome, although the hazard ratios were not significantly different from 1.",1
"Adjuvant capecitabine in combination with docetaxel and cyclophosphamide plus epirubicin for breast cancer: an open-label, randomised controlled trial.","BACKGROUND: Standard adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for patients with moderate-to-high-risk early breast cancer typically contain a taxane, an anthracycline, and cyclophosphamide. We aimed to investigate whether integration of capecitabine into such a regimen enhances outcome. METHODS: In this open-label trial, we randomly assigned (centrally by computer; stratified by node status, HER2 status, and centre) 1500 women with axillary node-positive or high-risk node-negative breast cancer to either three cycles of capecitabine and docetaxel followed by three cycles of cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and capecitabine (capecitabine group, n=753), or to three cycles of docetaxel followed by three cycles of cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and fluorouracil (control group, n=747). The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival. A planned interim analysis was done after 3 years' median follow-up. Efficacy analyses were by modified intention to treat. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00114816. FINDINGS: Two patients in each group were excluded from efficacy analyses because of withdrawal of consent or distant metastases. After a median follow-up of 35 months (IQR 25.5-43.6), recurrence-free survival at 3 years was better with the capecitabine regimen than with control (93%vs 89%; hazard ratio 0.66, 95% CI 0.47-0.94; p=0.020). The capecitabine regimen was associated with more cases of grade 3 or 4 diarrhoea (46/740 [6%] vs 25/741 [3%]) and hand-foot syndrome (83/741 [11%] vs 2/741 [<1%]) and the control regimen with more occurrences of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (368/375 [98%] vs 325/378 [86%]) and febrile neutropenia (65/741 [9%] vs 33/742 [4%]). More patients discontinued planned treatment in the capecitabine group than in the control group (178/744 [24%] vs 23/741 [3%]). Four patients in the capecitabine group and two in the control group died from potentially treatment-related causes. INTERPRETATION: The capecitabine-containing chemotherapy regimen reduced breast cancer recurrence compared with a control schedule of standard agents. Capecitabine administration was frequently discontinued because of adverse effects. FUNDING: Roche, Sanofi-Aventis, AstraZeneca, Cancer Society of Finland.",1
"Phase III study to evaluate the use of high-dose chemotherapy as consolidation of treatment for high-risk postoperative breast cancer: Japan Clinical Oncology Group study, JCOG 9208.","A randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) as consolidation of the treatment of high-risk postoperative breast cancer. Patients under 56 years of age with stage I to IIIB breast cancer involving 10 or more axillary lymph nodes were eligible. The primary endpoint was relapse-free survival (RFS). Between May 1993 and March 1999, 97 patients were enrolled, and two patients became ineligible. The median age of the 97 patients was 46 years (range 27-55 years), and 72 (74%) were premenopausal. The median number of involved axillary nodes was 16 (range 10-49). All patients had undergone a radical mastectomy. Major characteristics were well balanced between the treatment arms. Forty-eight patients in the standard-dose (STD) arm received six courses of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and 5-fluorouracil followed by tamoxifen. Forty-nine patients were assigned to undergo HDC with cyclophosphamide and thiotepa after six courses of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and 5-fluorouracil followed by tamoxifen; however, 15 of these patients (31%) did not undergo HDC. HDC was well tolerated without any treatment-related mortality. At a median follow-up of 63 months, the 5-year RFS of 47 eligible patients in the STD arm and 48 eligible patients in the HDC arm was 37% and 52% on an intent-to-treat basis, respectively (P = 0.17). Five-year overall survival of all randomized patients was 62% for the STD arm and 63% for the HDC arm (P = 0.78). Although the prespecified values of the two arms were not so accurate as to allow detection of the observed difference, no advantage of HDC was observed in terms of RFS or overall survival.",1
Delayed adjuvant tamoxifen: ten-year results of a collaborative randomized controlled trial in early breast cancer (TAM-02 trial),"AIM: Immediate adjuvant tamoxifen reduces disease recurrence and improves survival in patients with early breast cancer. However, is it too late to administer tamoxifen to patients who have already undergone treatment, but were unable to benefit from this adjuvant therapy? The French National Cancer Centers (FNCLCC) have investigated the efficacy of delayed tamoxifen administration in a randomized controlled trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From September 1986 to October 1989, women with primary breast cancer, who had undergone surgery, radiotherapy, and/or received adjuvant chemotherapy but not hormone therapy more than two years earlier, were randomized to receive either 30 mg/day tamoxifen or no treatment. The 10-year disease-free and overall survival rates of the two groups of patients and of various subgroups were determined according to the Kaplan-Meyer method and compared by the log-rank test. RESULTS: This intention-to-treat analysis comprised 250 Introduction women in the tamoxifen group and 244 in the control group. Patient characteristics (age, T stage, number of positive nodes, receptor status, and interval since tumor treatment) were comparable in both groups. Delayed adjuvant tamoxifen significantly improved overall survival only in node-positive patients and in patients with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) or progesterone receptor-positive (PR+) tumors. Disease-free survival, however, was significantly improved in the global population and in several patient subgroups (node-positive, ER+, PR+). Patients in whom the interval between primary treatment and delayed adjuvant tamoxifen was greater than five years also had significantly improved disease-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: Overall and disease-free survival results indicate that delayed adjuvant tamoxifen administration (30 mg/day) is justified in women with early breast cancer, even if this treatment is initiated two or more years after primary treatment.",1
"A randomized placebo-controlled study of tamoxifen after adjuvant chemotherapy in premenopausal women with early breast cancer (National Cancer Institute of Canada--Clinical Trials Group Trial, MA.12).","BACKGROUND: In the early 1990s, the role of adjuvant tamoxifen in premenopausal women with early breast cancer (EBC) was not established. Similarly, optimum timing relative to adjuvant chemotherapy and efficacy of tamoxifen in hormone receptor-negative tumors were unclear.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Premenopausal women with EBC, any hormone receptor status, after surgery received standard adjuvant chemotherapy [doxorubicin (adriamycin)/cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/5-fluorouracil, or cyclophosphamide/epirubicin/5-fluorouracil] followed by randomization to tamoxifen or placebo for 5 years. Outcomes were overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), toxicity, and compliance with therapy.RESULTS: Median follow-up for 672 women was 9.7 years. Multivariate analysis showed improved DFS [78.2% versus 71.3% at 5 years; hazard ratio (HR) 0.77; P = 0.056] and a trend for improved OS (86.6% versus 82.1% at 5 years; HR 0.78; P = 0.12). There was no evidence of greater benefit for the receptor-positive subgroup. Compliance with treatment was suboptimal in both arms, with 103 (31%) women on tamoxifen and 70 (21%) on placebo-stopping therapy early because of toxicity, refusal, or other choices.CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant tamoxifen, given after chemotherapy to premenopausal women with EBC, improved 5-year DFS. Poor compliance may have reduced treatment efficacy.",1
"Venlafaxine is superior to clonidine as treatment of hot flashes in breast cancer patients--a double-blind, randomized study.","BACKGROUND: Classical hormone replacement therapy for hot flashes is contraindicated in breast cancer especially in endocrine responsive disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized phase III study, breast cancer patients suffering from hot flashes at least twice a day, who were not taking any medication against hypertension and depression received either clonidine 0.075 mg twice a day or venlafaxine 37.5 mg twice a day for 4 weeks. The primary end point was defined as the frequency of hot flashes after 4 weeks of treatment. A self-reported 1-week hot flash and other symptom questionnaire were kept before the start of treatment until the end of treatment course. RESULTS: From April 2002 to October 2004, 80 patients were recruited of whom 64 were assessable for efficacy analyses. Thirty-three received clonidine and 31 venlafaxine, nine patients stopped early because of side-effects and seven withdrew consent. At the end of treatment week 4, the median hot flash frequency dropped by 7.6 hot flashes per day for patients receiving venlafaxine and 4.85 hot flashes per day for those receiving clonidine (P = 0.025). CONCLUSION: Venlafaxine is significantly more effective in reducing the frequency of hot flashes in breast cancer patients than clonidine.",0
The effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation training in managing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in Chinese breast cancer patients: a randomised controlled trial.,"This study was a randomised controlled trial designed to assess the effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation training (PMRT) in the clinical management of chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting as an adjuvant intervention to accompany pharmacological antiemetic treatment (metoclopramide and dexamethasone i.v.). Seventy-one chemotherapy-naive breast cancer patients of an outpatient oncology unit of a university hospital in Hong Kong participated, with 38 subjects randomised to the experimental group and 33 to the control group. The intervention included the use of PMRT 1 h before chemotherapy was administered and daily thereafter for another 5 days (for a total of six PMRT sessions). Each session lasted for 25 min and was followed by 5 min of imagery techniques. The instruments used for data collection included the Chinese versions of the Profile of Mood States and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (measured before chemotherapy and then at day 7 and day 14 after chemotherapy), and the Morrow Assessment of Nausea and Vomiting Scale, which was used daily for the first 7 post-chemotherapy days. The use of PMRT considerably decreased the duration of nausea and vomiting in the experimental group compared with the control group ( P<0.05), whereas there were trends toward a lower frequency of nausea and vomiting ( P=0.07 and P=0.08 respectively). Neither nausea nor vomiting differed in intensity between the two groups. The significant effects were mainly evident on the first 4 post-chemotherapy days, when differences were statistically significant. Although there was a significantly less severe overall mood disturbance in the experimental group over time ( P<0.05), this did not apply in the case of anxiety. Such findings suggest that PMRT is a useful adjuvant technique to complement antiemetics for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and that incorporation of such interventions in the care plan can enhance the standards of care of cancer patients who experience side effects of chemotherapy.",0
Effect of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist on ovarian function after modern adjuvant breast cancer chemotherapy: the GBG 37 ZORO study.,"PURPOSE: Observational studies suggested that luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists (LHRHa) might prevent premature ovarian failure resulting from adjuvant chemotherapy in premenopausal patients. We aimed to test the efficacy of ovarian function preservation with the LHRHa goserelin in patients with breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective, randomized, open-label, controlled multicenter study, 60 patients younger than age 46 years with hormone-insensitive breast cancer were allocated to receive anthracycline/cyclophosphamide (with or without taxane) -based neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without goserelin. The first goserelin injection was administered at least 2 weeks before the first chemotherapy cycle, continuing at 3.6 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks until the end of the last cycle. The primary objective was the reappearance of normal ovarian function, defined as two consecutive menstrual periods within 21 to 35 days at 6 months after end of chemotherapy. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients (88.3%) experienced temporary amenorrhea (93.3% with v 83.3% without goserelin). No significant difference was observed regarding the reappearance of menstruation at 6 months after chemotherapy (70.0% with v 56.7% without goserelin; difference of 13.3%; 95% CI, -10.85 to 37.45; P = .284). All but one evaluable patient reported regular menses at 2 years after chemotherapy. Time to restoration of menstruation was 6.8 months (95% CI, 5.2 to 8.4) with goserelin and 6.1 months (95% CI, 5.3 to 6.8) without goserelin (P = .304). Chemotherapy resulted in a decreased ovarian reserve measured by inhibin B and anti-Müllerian hormone during follow-up, supporting the other findings. CONCLUSION: Premenopausal patients with breast cancer receiving goserelin simultaneously with modern neoadjuvant chemotherapy did not experience statistically significantly less amenorrhea 6 months after end of chemotherapy compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone.",0
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy in operable breast cancer.,"Primary chemotherapy in localised breast cancer may prevent tumour spread during surgical treatment and reduce proliferation of micrometastases. A randomised clinical trial, in 196 premenopausal and postmenopausal patients with operable (T2-3, N0-1b) breast cancer, was started in November 1983 at the Institut Curie to compare neoadjuvant and adjuvant regimens of chemotherapy with radiotherapy with or without surgery. The patients have been followed up for 35-70 months (median 54). A neoadjuvant group received two monthly cycles of intravenous doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide/5-fluorouracil before locoregional therapy and four cycles subsequently. Six monthly cycles following locoregional therapy were administered to the adjuvant group. Because of inclusion of postmenopausal and/or node-negative patients, compliance was less than optimal in 39 patients who were analysed separately according to actual dose received. Tumour response, evaluated after two cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, was significantly associated with dose (P = 0.003). Survival showed a slight non-significant advantage for the neoadjuvant group. Survival plotted by actual dose was also similar. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was safe and at least as effective as the adjuvant regimen. Patients have been accrued to a subsequent larger trial of chemotherapy as first-line treatment.",1
Prevention of bone loss by zoledronic acid in premenopausal women undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy persist up to one year following discontinuing treatment.,"Context: Adjuvant chemotherapy is associated with significant reductions in bone mineral density (BMD) in premenopausal women with breast cancer (BC) that is prevented with zoledronic acid (ZA) every 3 months for 1 yr. Objective: The aim of the study was to examine the effect on BMD of discontinuing ZA during the subsequent year. Design: We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial. Patients: Premenopausal women (mean age, 42 yr) undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy for BC participated in the study. Intervention: ZA (4 mg iv every 3 months) vs. placebo was administered for 12 months. Outcome Measures: We measured percentage change in BMD and bone turnover markers at 12 and 24 months (1 yr after last infusion). Results: Of 101 women randomized, 85 completed 12-month and 62 completed 24-month evaluations. In the placebo group, serum C-telopeptide (CTX) increased progressively over the first 12 months, returned toward baseline but remained significantly above baseline by 24 months. Lumbar spine BMD decreased from baseline by 5.5% at 12 and 6.3% at 24 months. Similarly, by 24 months, total hip and femoral neck BMD declined by 2.6 and 2.4%, respectively. In ZA patients, BMD remained stable (P < 0.0001 compared to placebo). Serum CTX declined significantly by 6 months, but returned to baseline by 12 months, remaining there at 24 months. Conclusions: Premenopausal women receiving chemotherapy for BC sustained significant bone loss during the first year, without recovery during the second year. ZA effectively prevented bone loss during the first year of chemotherapy. BMD remained stable 1 yr after completion of ZA. Serum CTX increased significantly by 12 and 24 months. More frequent administration may be required to suppress bone resorption in this patient population.",0
Histopathological assessment of anastrozole and tamoxifen as preoperative (neoadjuvant) treatment in postmenopausal Japanese women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer in the PROACT trial.,"PURPOSE: The PReOperative 'Arimidex' Compared with Tamoxifen (PROACT) trial compared neoadjuvant anastrozole and tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with large, operable or potentially operable, locally advanced hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Here, we compare objective clinical responses with histopathological tumor responses to therapy in a cohort of 97 Japanese patients, in order to investigate the consistency of assessment methods and the change in estrogen-receptor (ER) and progesterone-receptor (PgR) status. METHODS: Histopathological response and the change in ER and PgR status were assessed by comparing pathological specimens collected at baseline (via needle biopsy) with those collected at 3 months (from excised tumors). The response was evaluated using Pathological Response Criteria for Breast Cancer as defined by the Japanese Breast Cancer Society. The patients were randomized to receive anastrozole (n = 48) or tamoxifen (n = 49). RESULTS: A numerically greater histopathological response rate was observed when neoadjuvant anastrozole compared with neoadjuvant tamoxifen (35.4 and 12.2%, respectively). The histopathological and clinical objective response rates agreed in 63/97 patients. The ER status of 5/40 patients changed from positive at baseline to negative at 3 months in the anastrozole group compared with 20/37 patients in the tamoxifen group. The PgR status of 16/17 patients in the anastrozole group and of 1/11 patients in the tamoxifen group changed from positive to negative. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the findings of the main PROACT trial, which confirmed that anastrozole, as compared with tamoxifen, is an effective neoadjuvant endocrine treatment in objective response rates for postmenopausal women with large operable hormone-receptor positive breast cancer. Further follow-up is required to confirm whether histopathological responses to therapy correlate with an overall improvement in survival.",0
Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) allows acceleration and dose intensity increase of CEF chemotherapy: a randomised study in patients with advanced breast cancer.,"A randomised study was conducted in 62 patients with advanced breast cancer to assess whether granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) would yield an increase in the dose intensity of a standard-dose CEF regimen through an acceleration of chemotherapy administration. Patients received CEF (cyclophosphamide 600 mg m-2, epidoxorubicin 60 mg m-2 and fluorouracil 600 mg m-2) i.v. on day 1 or the same chemotherapy, plus GM-CSF 10 micrograms kg-1 s.c. starting from day 4, repeated as soon as haematopoietic recovery from nadir occurred. Patients in the CEF + GM-CSF group received chemotherapy at a median interval of 16 days compared with 20 days in the control group. This led to a significant increase (P = 0.02) in the dose intensity actually administered in the third, fourth and sixth cycles: +28%, +25%, +20% respectively. Non-haematological toxicity was mild. GM-CSF had to be reduced or suspended in 50% of patients because of toxicity. Haematological toxicity, mainly cumulative anaemia and thrombocytopenia, was manageable. An increase in response rate for patients with measurable disease, of borderline statistical significance (P = 0.088, P for trend = 0.018), from 42% in the CEF group to 69% in the CEF + GM-CSF group, was observed. This randomised trial indicates that GM-CSF is useful for chemotherapy acceleration. Accelerated CEF + GM-CSF is a moderately dose-intensive regimen that can be administered in an outpatient clinic and is associated with a high objective response.",0

Hormonal therapy of breast cancer with special reference to Masteril therapy.,"From 1968 to 1972, a trial of a new agent, drostanolone propionate (Masteril), was conducted. This agent was tested against oophorectomy in a group of premenopausal patients, against nandrolone phenylpropionate (Durabolin) in a perimenopausal group, and against ethinyl oestradiol in a postmenopausal group. In the premenopausal group, 44% responded to Masteril and 22% to oophorectomy. In the perimenopausal group, 34,5% responded to Masteril and 39% to Durabolin. In the postmenopausal group, 57% responded to oestrogens and 38,5% to Masteril. The side-effects of Masteril are generally not serious and rarely contra-indicate its use. Masteril has been shown to be a useful and safe agent for all age groups, even though it may appear to be less effective than oestrogens in the postmenopausal patients.",1
SABRE-B: an evaluation of paclitaxel and bevacizumab with or without sunitinib as first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway can be targeted through VEGF neutralization or VEGF receptor (VEGFR) blockade using tyrosine kinase inhibition. Because laboratory models suggest that combining these approaches might be synergistic, we sought to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of combining sunitinib with paclitaxel + bevacizumab (PB). METHODS: Patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, metastatic breast cancer receiving first-line chemotherapy were randomized to PB or PB with sunitinib (PBS), with planned escalation of the sunitinib dose. RESULTS: Forty-six patients were randomized to PB or PBS with sunitinib dosed at 25 mg p.o. daily. Patients receiving PBS encountered substantial toxicity that precluded adequate treatment. The percentage of patients with grade ≥3 adverse events was greater in the PBS arm than the PB arm (83% versus 57%), and sunitinib dosing was modified in 78% of patients, most often due to neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and fatigue. In addition, 44% of patients had sunitinib dose reduction to 12.5 mg, and 39% required discontinuation. Patients receiving PBS had more bevacizumab treatment interruptions and discontinuations because of toxicity. Median treatment duration was longer in the PB arm compared with the PBS arm (14.1 versus 11.1 weeks), reflecting early treatment discontinuation of PBS. Because of poor tolerability of the addition of sunitinib to PB, the planned sunitinib dose escalation was halted and the study accrual was terminated. CONCLUSION: Adding sunitinib to standard doses of bevacizumab plus paclitaxel for metastatic breast cancer is not feasible. Different strategies will be required to evaluate whether there is additional clinical benefit to combining VEGF/VEGFR-targeted agents.",1
Progress report on two clinical trials in women with advanced breast cancer. Trial I: tamoxifen versus tamoxifen plus aminoglutethimide. Trial II: aminoglutethimide in patients with prior tamoxifen exposure.,"A progress report is presented on two on-going clinical trials in women with advanced breast cancer. In Trial I to date, 56 patients have been randomized to tamoxifen (TAM) alone or TAM plus aminoglutethimide (AG) (plus hydrocortisone). Patients failing TAM can then receive AG. The two groups are reasonably well balanced with respect to prior hormonal therapy exposure (TAM, 19%; TAM plus AG, 17%), age, disease-free interval, performance score, and estrogen receptor status. The TAM plus AG group has a higher incidence of visceral dominant disease (41 versus 26%) and prior chemotherapy exposure (41 versus 33%). Responses have been observed in 7 of 27 (26%) patients on TAM and 11 of 28 (39%) on TAM plus AG. Median times to treatment failure (defined as disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient refusal) are 211 and 123 days, respectively (log-rank on time to treatment failure, p = 0.87). Toxicity is greater for TAM plus AG with a higher incidence of skin rash, lethargy, and dizziness. Thrombotic events were seen in one patient on TAM and two patients on TAM plus AG. One patient on TAM plus AG developed leukopenia and sepsis. The data are too preliminary for one to draw firm conclusions regarding relative efficacy. In TRial II to date, 35 patients with prior tamoxifen exposure have received AG. The mean number of prior systemic therapies is 3.2 (range, 1 to 7). The response rate is 20% and similar with (21%) or without (19%) prior chemotherapy exposure. The median time to treatment failure is 92 days. One patient developed leukopenia and sepsis. Additional patient accrual is necessary to allow characterization of potential efficacy within prognostically important subsets.",0
Diethylstilbestrol: recommended dosages for different categories of breast cancer patients. Report of the Cooperative Breast Cancer Group.,"A total of 523 postmenopausal breast cancer patients with progressive disease were entered in a radomized, double-blind study of four dosages of diethylstibestrol (DES): 1.5, 15, 150, OR 1,500 MG/DAY. Higher dosages produced significantly (p less than .05) higher regression rates: 21% for the 1,500 mg dosage, 17% for the 150 mg dosage, 15% for the 15 mg dosage, and 10% for 1.5 mg dosage. Durations of regressions were similar regardless of the dosages used to induce them. Although the highest dosage produced the highest regression rate overall, selecting the best dosage or treatment of choice for each type of patient based on menopausal age and on dominant metastatic site would result in more regressions.",0
"Delayed progression of bone metastases with pamidronate therapy in breast cancer patients: a randomized, multicenter phase III trial.","A total of 295 patients with lytic bone metastases from breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus pamidronate (Aredia) 45 mg intravenously every 3 weeks. Primary endpoints were time to progressive bone disease (evaluated by blind extramural review), and improvement in pain (according to a 6-point self-assessment scale). Secondary endpoints included incidence of bone-related complications (pathological fractures, tumor-induced hypercalcemia, need for radiotherapy), sclerotic response of lytic lesions, WHO performance status, and analgesic score. Median time to bone progression was 249 days and 168 days in the pamidronate and control groups respectively (p = 0.02). Marked improvement in bone pain was observed in 44% of patients receiving pamidronate compared to 30% in controls (p = 0.025). With respect to secondary endpoints, pamidronate reduced the need for radiotherapy (66 times vs. 82 times in controls), and median time to radiotherapy was 697 days with pamidronate, 571 in the control arm. No severe adverse reactions or worsening of chemotherapy-induced toxicities were observed during 1598 pamidronate infusions. We conclude that intravenous pamidronate is well tolerated, significantly prolongs time to progressive bone disease, and significantly improves bone pain in patients with osteolytic metastases from breast cancer.",0
Concomitant docetaxel plus gemcitabine versus sequential docetaxel followed by gemcitabine in anthracycline-pretreated metastatic or locally recurrent inoperable breast cancer patients: a prospective multicentre trial of the Central European Cooperative Oncology Group (CECOG).,"Docetaxel (D) plus gemcitabine (G) is an active combination in anthracycline pre-treated breast cancer. Impact of sequential administration of these drugs is unclear. This trial aimed to compare concomitant DG with sequential D --> G. Patients were randomised to eight cycles of gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m2 on days 1 + 8 plus docetaxel 75 mg/m2 on day 8, or 4 cycles of docetaxel 100 mg/m2 on day 1, followed by four cycles of gemcitabine 1,250 mg/m2 on days 1 + 8, in a 21-day schedule. Time to progression (TTP) was defined as primary endpoint; secondary endpoints were overall response rate (ORR), response duration (RD), overall survival (OS) and toxicity. Due to poor recruitment, the trial was terminated after 100 of a pre-planned 430 patients. Patient characteristics were well balanced. No significant difference was observed in terms of TTP, ORR, RD and OS. Grade 3/4 adverse events encompassed leucopoenia (29 vs.68%, P < 0.001), neutropoenia (49 vs. 83%, P < 0.001) and febrile neutropoenia (4 vs. 9%, n.s.), all favouring D --> G. No difference in efficacy was observed between concomitant and sequential treatment. D --> G produced significantly more episodes of haematological toxicity due to the administration of docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 without GCSF support.",1
"Effect of coenzyme Q10, riboflavin and niacin on serum CEA and CA 15-3 levels in breast cancer patients undergoing tamoxifen therapy.","In breast cancer patients, it is not the primary tumour, but its metastases at distant sites that are the main cause of death. Circulating breast cancer tumour markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 15-3 (CA 15-3) are reliable indicators of impending relapse, in which an increasing tumour marker level is associated with a very likelihood of developing recurrence. In the present study, 84 breast cancer patients were randomized to receive a daily supplement of 100 mg coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), 10 mg riboflavin and 50 mg niacin (CoRN) one dosage per day along with 10 mg tamoxifen (TAM) twice a day. Serum CEA and CA 15-3 levels were elevated in untreated breast cancer patients (group II) and their tumour marker levels significantly reduced upon tamoxifen therapy for more than 1 year (group III). Group III patients supplemented with CoRN for 45 d (group IV) and 90 d (group V) along with tamoxifen significantly reduced CEA and CA 15-3 levels. This study suggests supplementing CoRN to breast cancer patients along with tamoxifen reduces the serum tumour marker level and thereby reduce the risk of cancer recurrence and metastases.",0
A combined analysis of two pivotal randomized trials of a single dose of pegfilgrastim per chemotherapy cycle and daily Filgrastim in patients with stage II-IV breast cancer.,"This combined, retrospective analysis compared once-per-chemotherapy-cycle pegfilgrastim with daily Filgrastim in breast cancer patients undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy enrolled in two similarly designed, randomized, double-blind, pivotal trials. On day 2 of each chemotherapy cycle, a single subcutaneous (SC) injection of pegfilgrastim [either 6 mg (n=77) or 100 microg/kg (n=149)] was administered, or daily Filgrastim SC injections (5 microg/kg/day; n=222) were initiated and continued until either absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > or =10 x 10(9)/l after the expected nadir or for up to 14 days, whichever occurred first. Individually, each of these trials demonstrated that a single pegfilgrastim injection per cycle is as effective at reducing the duration of severe neutropenia as daily injections of Filgrastim. Clinical efficacy data from the two trials were combined for analysis (n=448). The risk of febrile neutropenia (FN; absolute neutrophil count <0.5 x 10(9)/l with fever > or =38.2 degrees C) was significantly lower [11% vs 19%, respectively; relative risk = 0.56 (95% confidence interval: 0.35, 0.89)] in patients receiving pegfilgrastim than for those receiving Filgrastim. Trends towards lower risks of hospitalization and intravenous anti-infective use were also observed. These observations were consistent irrespective of risk factors, including age, disease stage, performance status and prior treatment. Pegfilgrastim may offer patients more effective protection against neutropenic complications of chemotherapy with fewer injections and less disruption to their lives.",0
Investigation of a new pure antiestrogen (ICI 182780) in women with primary breast cancer.,"We have conducted a clinical trial of a novel pure antiestrogen, 7 alpha-[9-(4,4,5,5,5-pentafluoropentylsulfinyl)nonyl]estra-1,3,5,(1 0)-triene-3,17 beta-diol (ICI 182780), to assess its tolerance, pharmacokinetics, and short term biological effects in women with primary breast cancer. Fifty-six patients were randomized to either a control group (n = 19), in which they received no preoperative treatment, or a treatment group (n = 37), in which they received daily i.m. injections of ICI 182780 at doses of 6 mg (n = 21) or 18 mg (n = 16) for 7 days prior to primary breast surgery. Serum drug concentrations, gonadotropin levels, and sex hormone-binding globulin levels were measured during the study period by radioimmunoassay. Expression of estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors, the estrogen-induced protein pS2, and the cell proliferation-related antigen Ki67 was determined immunocytochemically in pre- and poststudy tumor samples. Treatment with ICI 182780 caused no serious drug-related adverse events and had no effect on serum gonadotropin or sex hormone-binding globulin levels. Minor adverse events occurred in 5 patients receiving the 6-mg dose and 3 patients receiving the 18-mg dose. The serum concentration of ICI 182780 was dose dependent but showed variation between individuals. There was evidence of an approximately 3-fold drug accumulation over the short treatment period but steady state levels were not reached by the end of the 7 days. In patients with ER-positive tumors, treatment with ICI 182780 was associated with significant reductions in the tumor expression of ER (median ER index, 0.72 before versus 0.02 after treatment; P < 0.001), progesterone receptor (median progesterone receptor index, 0.50 before versus 0.01 after treatment; P < 0.05), and Ki67 (median Ki67 labeling index, 3.2 before versus 1.1 after treatment; P < 0.05). Treatment with ICI 182780 also resulted in a significant reduction in pS2 expression (P < 0.05) but this appeared unrelated to tumor ER status. In conclusion, ICI 182780 was well tolerated after short term administration and produced demonstrable antiestrogenic effects in human breast tumors in vivo, without showing evidence of agonist activity. These properties identify ICI 182780 as a candidate agent with which to evaluate whether a pure estrogen antagonist offers any additional benefit in the treatment of human breast cancer over conventional nonsteroidal antiestrogens, typified by tamoxifen, which exhibit variable degrees of agonist activity.",1
A phase II study of epirubicin in breast cancer.,"We evaluated the efficacy of epirubicin in a phase II trial in breast cancer, as well as its cardiac toxicity. The study was carried out on 40 female patients with advanced, metastatic, or recurrent breast cancer. The patients were grouped into two groups: group I received 30 mg/m2 epirubicin weekly, and group II 90 mg/m2 epirubicin every 3 weeks. Cardiac monitoring was by ECG, roentgenography, echocardiography and endomyocardial biopsies. Clinical results were 35.3% overall response in group I, and 50% overall response in group II. No untoward cardiac toxicities were encountered. We conclude that epirubicin is an effective agent in breast cancer with relatively little cardiac toxicity.",1
Comparison of the systemic and intratumoral effects of tamoxifen and the aromatase inhibitor vorozole in postmenopausal patients with primary breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: To determine biologic differences, if any, between presurgical endocrine treatment with an aromatase inhibitor (vorozole) and tamoxifen in patients with postmenopausal primary breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Randomization was to 12 weeks of 2.5 mg of vorozole per day or 20 mg of tamoxifen per day, both orally. Clinical response was assessed monthly together with serum sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estrogens (E1, E2, and E1S), lipids, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and bone metabolites (CrossLaps CTx). Tissue samples for Ki67, apoptotic index (AI), estrogen receptor, and progesterone receptor were collected at 0, 2, and 12 weeks. RESULTS: Ki67 fell by 58% and 43% (means) at 2 weeks in the vorozole and tamoxifen patients, respectively (P =.13). In the vorozole group, the correlations of proportional changes in Ki67 at 2 weeks with tumor volume changes and clinical response at 12 weeks were not significant (P =.09) and marginally significant (P =.04), respectively. Serum lipids did not differ between groups. Serum levels of EI, E2, and E1S were suppressed markedly by vorozole, whereas levels of SHBG increased and LH and FSH fell significantly with tamoxifen. IGF-1 levels fell significantly with tamoxifen (P =.001) compared with the nonsignificant rise with vorozole. Twelve-week CTx values fell by 19% with tamoxifen (P =.006) and rose by 11% with vorozole (P =.15). CONCLUSION: The correlation with vorozole of Ki67 with volume and clinical response supports this as an intermediate marker. The nonsignificant effects on bone and lipid metabolism by the aromatase inhibitor may be important to consider for adjuvant and potential prevention strategies.",0
FEC mobilized stem cells for high-dose therapy in breast cancer patients. SB6 9401 Study Group.,"The feasibility of mobilizing peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) using anthracycline containing polychemotherapy and G-CSF on the first 50 patients randomized to the high-dose arm in the adjuvant SBG 9401 is investigated. The patients were treated with standard FEC (5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m2, epirubicin 60 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2) for two courses followed by a modified third FEC course with a C dose of 1200 mg/m2 supported with subcutaneous G-CSF (filgrastim) at 5 mg/kg followed by harvest around day 11. The mean yield of CD34+ cells per patient was 10.6x10(6)/kg (range 2.6-29.1). The side effects after the third course were low and only one patient developed an uncomplicated granulopenic fever. Our data indicated a correlation between number of transfused CD34+ cells and days to neutrophil and platelet recovery. In conclusion, the modified FEC regimen followed by G-CSF is a feasible method for PBSC mobilization in the adjuvant setting.",0
Pharmacokinetics of intravenous and oral cyclophosphamide in the presence of methotrexate and fluorouracil.,"Cyclophosphamide was administered to 12 breast cancer patients in combination with methotrexate and fluorouracil. Doses prescribed were cyclophosphamide 75 mg/m2, methotrexate 30 mg/m2 and fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 (per square meter body surface). Cyclophosphamide was administered intravenously and orally in aqueous solutions and in tablets in a randomized cross-over trial. Methotrexate and fluorouracil were administered intravenously, methotrexate was given first and then fluorouracil. Assays of cyclophosphamide in blood plasma were performed by capillary gas chromatography. Data of mean bioavailability of cyclophosphamide administered by tablets were suggestive of sufficient absorption. In 2 patients, however, a lower bioavailability of cyclophosphamide was demonstrated. Intra-individual differences in the terminal slope of the plasma decay curves after intravenous and oral administration in some patients decreased the calculated bioavailability of cyclophosphamide, if these values were included in the calculation of cyclophosphamide bioavailability. Compared with the administration of the solutions peak times, lag-times and mean absorption times of cyclophosphamide given in tablets were markedly prolonged. It is concluded that interactions between cyclophosphamide and methotrexate and/or fluorouracil after oral dosing as tablets are different from interactions observed after intravenous administration of cyclosphosphamide.",0
"A randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of the effects of d-methylphenidate on fatigue and cognitive dysfunction in women undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.","BACKGROUND: Women who receive adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer develop fatigue, and a subset reports cognitive impairment. Methylphenidate is reported to improve fatigue and to decrease cognitive impairment in other populations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Women were randomised early during their chemotherapy to receive d-methylphenidate (d-MPH), a form of methylphenidate, or an identical appearing placebo. All participants took placebo for one cycle to ensure compliance and then study medication until completion of chemotherapy. Subjects were assessed at baseline, end of chemotherapy and at approximately 6 months follow-up with the High Sensitivity Cognitive Screen (HSCS) and the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R). They also completed the self-report Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) and FACT-F (F = fatigue) questionnaires, evaluating quality of life and fatigue. RESULTS: A total of 57 evaluable women were randomised: 29 to d-MPH and 28 to placebo; the study did not meet its accrual goal of 170 patients, mainly because women were reluctant to take additional medication in general and methylphenidate in particular. Groups were well matched for age (median, 50 years) and education. d-MPH and placebo were well tolerated. There were no significant differences between the randomised groups in classification of cognitive function by HSCS or in summed FACT-F fatigue scores (the primary endpoints of the study) at any of the assessments. There were also no differences in HLTV-R scores or quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: This study is underpowered, but there are no trends to suggest that d-MPH, taken concurrently with adjuvant chemotherapy, improves quality of life or fatigue.",0
Response to second line chemo-endocrine treatment may prolong the overall survival of advanced breast cancer patients.,"Prognostic factors and the influence of response to therapy on survival in advanced breast cancer patients remains to be fully elucidated. One hundred and two patients with advanced breast cancer refractory to a combination chemotherapy (FAC) were investigated for response and survival in a randomized trial comparing MMV chemotherapy (mitomycin C, methotrexate, vincristine) alone, or with medroxyprogesterone acetate, or with prednisolone. A total response rate of 28.4% (29/102) was obtained in MMVX. In this second-line chemo-endocrine treatment, univariate and multivariate analyses using 14 clinical factors were performed for response as well as for overall survival of the patients. The logistic regression analysis showed that age, period between recurrence and MMVX, and PS were significant factors for response. According to the Cox's proportional hazard model, factors of PS, period between recurrence and MMVX, dominant site of metastasis and performance of adjuvant therapy were significant for survival. The landmark method (3-month) showed that there was a significant difference in survival by the response category (Kaplan-Meier method with logrank test, p < 0.0001). In the patient population at the landmark time, the Cox model indicated that the response was the most important for survival, but was significantly modified by some factors such as PS. In advanced breast cancer patients treated with a 2nd-line chemo-endocrine treatment, the response to therapy might be a significant determinant for survival of the patients. Prognostic factors for survival should be defined in this stage of malignancy.",0
Zoledronic acid prevents bone loss in premenopausal women undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: Adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer (BC) may be associated with increased rates of bone loss and decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and may lead to premature osteoporosis and increased fracture risk. We examined whether zoledronic acid (ZA) prevents bone loss in premenopausal women receiving chemotherapy for early-stage BC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, phase III trial comparing ZA (4 mg intravenously every 3 months) versus placebo for 1 year. Premenopausal women underwent serial BMD measurements before initiating chemotherapy and at 6 and 12 months. The primary outcome was percent change in lumbar spine (LS) BMD at 6 months. Secondary outcomes were percent change at any BMD site and markers of bone turnover at 12 months. Linear mixed model analysis for repeated measures was performed. RESULTS: Of 101 women who were randomly assigned and completed baseline evaluation, 96 completed the 6-month evaluation, and 85 completed the 12-month evaluation. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the groups. Mean age was 42 years. Placebo was associated with significant decline in LS BMD at both 6 (2.4%) and 12 (4.1%) months. Similarly, total hip BMD declined by 0.8% at 6 months and 2.6% at 12 months. In contrast, BMD remained stable in ZA patients (P < .0001 compared with placebo). CONCLUSION: Premenopausal women receiving chemotherapy for BC sustained significant bone loss at the LS and hip, whereas BMD remained stable in women who received ZA. Administration of ZA during the first year of chemotherapy is an effective and well-tolerated strategy for preventing bone loss.",0
Tamoxifen protects against steroid-induced bone loss.,"As part of a clinical trial of adjuvant endocrine treatment in postmenopausal women with operable breast cancer serial bone density measurements have been performed by dual photon absorptiometry. Tamoxifen alone was given to 26 women, and 20 received additional prednisolone. By 24 months after entry there was no significant difference between mean bone density of the two groups, nor any significant change from baseline levels. There was a mean gain of 0.46% in the tamoxifen group and 1.95% in those given additional prednisolone. Thus the predicted steroid-induced bone loss was inhibited by tamoxifen. This may be of more general use in prevention of osteoporosis in patients requiring long-term steroid treatment.",0
Glutamine supplementation in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy: a double-blind randomized study.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of glutamine in preventing doxifluridine-induced diarrhea and the potential impact of glutamine on the tumor growth. We investigated 65 patients with advanced breast cancer receiving doxifluridine in a double-blind randomized fashion: 33 patients took glutamine (30 g/d, divided in 3 doses of 10 g each) for 8 consecutive days (5-12h) during each interval between chemotherapy, which was administered from day 1 to 4. Thirty-two patients took an equal dose of placebo (maltodextrine). The incidence of diarrhea was registered after each cycle of chemotherapy and severity was scored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Bethesda, Maryland, classification. The tumor response was evaluated by the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. A total of 278 and 259 cycles (median 10 cycles), respectively, were delivered in glutamine and placebo groups. There were 34 and 32 episodes of diarrhea in glutamine and placebo groups, with no statistical difference overall, in the severity and duration of tumor growth, there was no difference in the response rate (21% and 28% of complete or partial response, respectively), in median time to response (2 mo), or in median duration of response. In conclusion, glutamine did not prevent the occurrence of the doxifluridine-induced diarrhea and did not have any impact on tumor response to chemotherapy.",0
"Factors influencing the interim interpretation of a breast cancer trial: danger of achieving the ""expected"" result.","Interim analyses of a metastatic breast cancer trial suggested a significant survival benefit for a five-drug combination chemotherapy compared to a single agent sequential treatment. Subsequent analyses failed to support this observation. Factors influencing the interim interpretation of this trial were investigated and found to include: delayed reporting of data in key cases, treatment effect limited to a patient subset, and problems related to achieving the ""expected"" result.",0
Sequential preoperative or postoperative docetaxel added to preoperative doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide for operable breast cancer:National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project Protocol B-27.,"PURPOSE: This study was designed to determine the effect of adding docetaxel (T) to preoperative doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) on breast cancer response rates and disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women with operable breast cancer (N = 2,411) were randomly assigned to receive preoperative AC followed by surgery, AC followed by T and surgery, or AC followed by surgery and then T. Tamoxifen was initiated concurrently with chemotherapy. Median time on study for 2,404 patients with follow-up was 77.9 months. RESULTS: Addition of T to AC did not significantly impact DFS or OS. There were trends toward improved DFS with addition of T. The addition of T reduced the incidence of local recurrences as first events (P = .0034). Preoperative T, but not postoperative T, significantly improved DFS in patients who had a clinical partial response after AC (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.91; P = .007). Pathologic complete response, which was doubled by addition of preoperative T, was a significant predictor of OS regardless of treatment (HR = 0.33; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.47; P < .0001). Pathologic nodal status after chemotherapy was a significant predictor of OS (P < .0001). CONCLUSION: The addition of preoperative or postoperative T after preoperative AC did not significantly affect OS, slightly improved DFS, and decreased the incidence of local recurrences. The sample size of this study was not sufficient to yield significance for the moderate DFS improvement. Concurrent use of tamoxifen may have limited the impact of adding T.",1
Cimetidine does not influence TIL in breast cancer.,Cimetidine is known to have immunomodulatory effects and this study aimed to examine the effect of pre-operative cimetidine treatment on lymphocytic infiltration in n = 72 women with breast cancer randomised to 400 mg bd or placebo for five days presurgery. A combined index was devised by adding infiltrating lymphocyte percentage and lymphoid score. There were no significant differences in circumferential infiltrate and lymphoid follicles in cimetidine treated patients and control patients with breast cancer.,0
Dexrazoxane cardioprotection in advanced breast cancer patients undergoing high-dose epirubicin treatment.,"PURPOSE: We performed a randomized trial to evaluate the cardioprotective effect of dexrazoxane (DEX) in advanced breast cancer patients (ABC) treated with high single-dose epirubicin (EPI). A secondary objective was to determine the role of radioimmunoscintigraphy (RIS) in the assessment of epirubicin cardiotoxicity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-five patients with ABC were treated with EPI 160 mg/m2 by i.v. bolus every 3 weeks with or without DEX, 1,000 mg/m2 i.v. Cardiac monitoring included multigated radionuclide (MUGA) scan with determination of resting left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and RIS with 111-Indium antimyosin monoclonal antibodies. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 69% in the EPI arm and 67% in the EPI + DEX arm; median time to response and median time to progression were identical in both arms, being 2 and 8 months, respectively. Median survival was 19 months versus 29 months (p 0.21), respectively. DEX did not appear to contribute to extracardiac EPI toxicity. Congestive heart failure occurred only in the EPI arm (2 instances). LVEF significantly decreased from baseline only in the EPI group. An abnormal tracer uptake at RIS was observed early in both arms, but the increase in heart to lung ratio was much more evident in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: DEX significantly protects against the development of high dose epirubicin cardiotoxicity apparently without evidence of an adverse impact on antitumor activity and non cardiac toxicity. RIS is a very sensitive technique in detecting anthracycline cardiac damage, but its specificity is low and cannot be considered alone a primary test for guiding anthracycline treatment.",0
Venous thrombosis during multimodal treatment of primary breast carcinoma.,"In a cooperative group study of 433 breast cancer patients treated with 2 years of postmastectomy chemotherapy, 22 (5%) developed venous thromboses of various types. Two patients died. None of the patients had demonstrable tumor metastases at the time of the venous thrombosis, although seven had metastases a median of 11 months after the thromboses. Thirteen living patients have not had tumor recurrences. No patient developed thrombosis after the chemotherapy was completed. It is possible that one or more of the chemotherapeutic agents initiated the clotting problems. Thrombophlebitis is a possible problem occurring during adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer and requires prompt treatment.",0
The impact of a supplementary medication review and counselling service within the oncology outpatient setting.,"The impact on the care of breast cancer patients, of a pharmacy technician-led medication review and counselling clinic, provided in an outpatient setting, was investigated using a controlled randomised study. Compared to the controls, clinic patients showed a significantly improved level of understanding of their chemotherapy support medication (95% CI for difference in mean knowledge rating scores=2.165-2.826, P<0.001) and a significant reduction in the median number of support items required (two compared to five in the control, P<0.001). This resulted in a significant reduction in mean medication expenditure per patient (26.70 vs 10.20 British Pound, 95% CI for the mean difference in cost 6.72 - 26.26 British Pound, P<0.001). The clinic was also associated with significant reductions in chemotherapy delays (P<0.001) and dose reductions due to side effects (P=0.003). Other benefits from the clinic were a reduction in pharmacy dispensing time and a highly significant reduction in pharmacy time spent resolving post-clinic prescription queries (P<0.001). Taking into account the initial technician training cost, the scheme represented an annual saving to the Trust of over 15,000 British Pound. The clinic serves as a model for those wishing to improve outpatient services to breast cancer patients.",0
Effect of a vigorous aerobic regimen on physical performance in breast cancer patients - a randomized controlled pilot trial.,"This randomized, controlled pilot trial was carried out to assess the feasibility and efficacy of an aerobic exercise in enhancing physical performance of breast cancer patients after adjuvant treatments. The potential of the training regimen to prevent accompanying bone loss was also assessed. Thirty patients, 41-65 years of age, were randomly assigned into training or control groups shortly after adjuvant chemo- or radiotherapy. The 12-week training included a guided aerobic exercise session once a week (the effective part being either step aerobic- or circuit-training in alternate weeks) and similar home exercise sessions twice a week. Adherence to the guided sessions was 78%, while home training was performed an average 2.1 times per week. Agility assessed with figure-8 running test and peak jumping power showed significant between-group treatment-effects (approximately 5% and approximately 10%, respectively). Judged from the accelerometer data, reaction forces up to six times body weight occurred during the training, which implies that the training could also have potential to affect bone mass. The present exercise regimen turned out to be feasible and effective among breast cancer patients in terms of physical performance. Large controlled trials are necessary to confirm these findings.",0
Anxiolytic effects of a yoga program in early breast cancer patients undergoing conventional treatment: a randomized controlled trial.,"OBJECTIVES: This study compares the anxiolytic effects of a yoga program and supportive therapy in breast cancer outpatients undergoing conventional treatment at a cancer centre. METHODS: Ninety-eight stage II and III breast cancer outpatients were randomly assigned to receive yoga (n=45) or brief supportive therapy (n=53) prior to their primary treatment i.e., surgery. Only those subjects who received surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and six cycles of chemotherapy were chosen for analysis following intervention (yoga, n=18, control, n=20). Intervention consisted of yoga sessions lasting 60min daily while the control group was imparted supportive therapy during their hospital visits as a part of routine care. Assessments included Speilberger's State Trait Anxiety Inventory and symptom checklist. Assessments were done at baseline, after surgery, before, during, and after radiotherapy and chemotherapy. RESULTS: A GLM-repeated measures ANOVA showed overall decrease in both self-reported state anxiety (p<0.001) and trait anxiety (p=0.005) in yoga group as compared to controls. There was a positive correlation between anxiety states and traits with symptom severity and distress during conventional treatment intervals. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that yoga can be used for managing treatment-related symptoms and anxiety in breast cancer outpatients.",0
Gabapentin for hot flashes in 420 women with breast cancer: a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Most women receiving systemic therapy for breast cancer experience hot flashes. We undertook a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-institutional trial to assess the efficacy of gabapentin in controlling hot flashes in women with breast cancer. METHODS: 420 women with breast cancer who were having two or more hot flashes per day were randomly assigned placebo, gabapentin 300 mg/day, or gabapentin 900 mg/day by mouth in three divided doses for 8 weeks. Each patient kept a 1-week, self-report diary on the frequency, severity, and duration of hot flashes before the start of the study and during weeks 4 and 8 of treatment. Analyses were by intention to treat. FINDINGS: Evaluable data were available on 371 participants at 4 weeks (119 placebo, 123 gabapentin 300 mg, and 129 gabapentin 900 mg) and 347 at 8 weeks (113 placebo, 114 gabapentin 300 mg, and 120 gabapentin 900 mg). The percentage decreases in hot-flash severity score between baseline and weeks 4 and 8, respectively were: 21% (95% CI 12 to 30) and 15% (1 to 29) in the placebo group; 33% (23 to 43) and 31% (16 to 46) in the group assigned gabapentin 300 mg; and 49% (42 to 56) and 46% (34 to 58) in the group assigned gabapentin 900 mg. The differences between the groups were significant (p=0.0001 at 4 weeks and p=0.007 at 8 weeks by ANCOVA for overall treatment effect, adjusted for baseline values); only the higher dose of gabapentin was associated with significant decreases in hot-flash frequency and severity. INTERPRETATION: Gabapentin is effective in the control of hot flashes at a dose of 900 mg/day, but not at a dose of 300 mg/day. This drug should be considered for treatment of hot flashes in women with breast cancer.",0
Increased thromboembolic complications with concurrent tamoxifen and chemotherapy in a randomized trial of adjuvant therapy for women with breast cancer. National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group Breast Cancer Site Group.,"PURPOSE AND METHODS: Associations between thromboembolism and malignancy, usually widespread, and between thromboembolism and hormonal and/or chemotherapy have been previously reported. We performed a randomized trial of tamoxifen 30 mg/d for 2 years (T) versus T plus 6 months of intravenous chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) for postmenopausal women with involved axillary nodes and positive estrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor (PgR) status following primary therapy for breast cancer.RESULTS: We observed one or more thromboembolic events in 48 of 353 women (13.6%) allocated to receive T plus CMF in comparison to five of 352 women (2.6%) randomized to receive T alone (P < .0001). Six women in the T plus CMF arm, but none randomized to receive T alone, suffered two thromboembolic events while an study therapy. There were also significantly more women who developed severe (grade 3 to 5) thromboembolic events in the T plus CMF arm than in the T arm (34 v five; P < .0001). Most thromboembolic events (39 of 54) occurred while women were actually receiving chemotherapy (P < .0001). Thromboembolic complications resulted in more days in hospital and more deaths than any other complication of therapy, including infection, in this trial.CONCLUSION: Thromboembolism related to the addition of CMF chemotherapy to tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy in this group of women represents a relatively common and serious complication that may outweigh any benefits offered by this additional therapy.",0
Short-term tamoxifen plus chemotherapy: superior results in node-positive breast cancer.,"Three hundred eleven patients with node-positive breast cancer were randomized to one of three adjuvant treatments: cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil; all of the above with tamoxifen citrate; or all of the above with tamoxifen and bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination. Local therapy for all patients was a modified radical mastectomy. Estrogen receptors were measured on all primary tumors. Patients were stratified by the number of positive nodes (one to three nodes and more than three nodes) and estrogen-receptor value (less than 3 femtomole/mg and greater than or equal to 3 femtomole/mg). Follow-up is available, with a mean of 9.1 and maximum of 14.2 years. In this study the efficacy of short-term tamoxifen is apparent over that of chemoimmunotherapy alone and continues to be significant with prolonged follow-up. The addition of tamoxifen to chemoimmunotherapy significantly prolonged disease-free survival among patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors who were postmenopausal, who had larger tumors (greater than 3 cm), or who had more extensive axillary node involvement (more than three nodes). Tamoxifen improved overall survival for patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors larger than 3 cm. The addition of bacillus Calmette-Guerin Cytoxan, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, and tamoxifen did not significantly alter disease-free or overall survival.",1
ERBB2 amplification is associated with tamoxifen resistance in steroid-receptor positive breast cancer.,"Amplification and overexpression of the ERBB2 (HER-2/neu) oncogene has been implicated as contributing to the development of human breast cancer, and as a predictor of poor survival. In the present non-randomized study of 871 primary invasive breast tumours, ERBB2 activation was significantly correlated to a shorter disease-free and overall survival in the subgroup of patients receiving adjuvant tamoxifen therapy, but not in the untreated group. Further subcategorization demonstrated the relationship to poor prognosis to be confined to lymph node positive and steroid receptor-positive tumours. We suggest that steroid receptor and ERBB2-positive breast tumours are resistant to tamoxifen therapy and, supported by experimental evidence showing an oestrogen receptor dependent up-regulation of ERBB2 expression upon tamoxifen administration, possibly even growth stimulated by the drug.",0
Steroid hormone receptor levels and adjuvant tamoxifen in early breast cancer. Ten year results of the Naples (GUN) Study.,"Ten year disease-free survival (DFS) results of the Naples randomized trial of adjuvant tamoxifen (TM), 30 mg per day for 2 years versus no therapy according to receptor levels, are reported. From Feb. 1, 1978, through Dec. 31, 1983, 308 pre- and postmenopausal patients with early breast cancer entered the trial. Estrogen receptor (ER) data were available on 239 (77.6%) patients, progesterone receptor (PgR) data on 194 (63.0%), and both receptor data on 181 (58.8%). ER and PgR were assayed by dextran-coated charcoal technique in a single laboratory. The effect of adjuvant TM was significantly related to ER and PgR concentration of the primary tumor. The greatest TM benefit on DFS was evident in patients with the highest levels of receptors. The interaction between the treatment effect and receptor concentration was found whether ER and PgR were considered separately or together.",1
Tamoxifen beyond 5 years--patients' decisions regarding entry to the aTTom trial.,"The aim of this study was to assess among a population of women who had taken adjuvant tamoxifen for 5 years, how many were prepared to enter a randomised trial looking at the duration of tamoxifen treatment and what was the preference of those who declined trial entry. There is uncertainty as to the optimum duration of adjuvant tamoxifen and this is the subject of the aTTom (adjuvant Tamoxifen Treatment offer more?) trial in which patients are randomised to continue or stop tamoxifen after 5 years. Patients have been recruited to the aTTom trial in Dundee since 1996 and a record has been kept of all the patients with whom the trial was discussed. Patients who declined trial entry were allowed to choose whether to electively stop or continue tamoxifen. 306 patients were eligible for trial entry of whom 171 (56%) consented to randomisation (82 to continue and 89 to stop). Amongst the 135 (44%) who declined randomisation, 28 (21%) elected to stop tamoxifen treatment, 90 (67%) elected to continue and in 17 (13%) their decision was unclear. These results illustrate that patients eligible for the aTTom trial share our clinical equipoise. A majority (56%) of patients were agreeable to randomisation, but among those who declined, some (67%) preferred to continue, some (21%) to stop tamoxifen. This trial is unusual in that the patients have already experienced the treatment options, so the patients' preferences reflect a truly informed choice.",0
Q-TWiST analysis of lapatinib combined with capecitabine for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.,"The addition of lapatinib (Tykerb/Tyverb) to capecitabine (Xeloda) delays disease progression more effectively than capecitabine monotherapy in women with previously treated HER2+ metastatic breast cancer (MBC). The quality-adjusted time without symptoms of disease or toxicity of treatment (Q-TWiST) method was used to compare treatments. The area under survival curves was partitioned into health states: toxicity (TOX), time without symptoms of disease progression or toxicity (TWiST), and relapse period until death or end of follow-up (REL). Average times spent in each state, weighted by utility, were derived and comparisons of Q-TWiST between groups performed with varying combinations of the utility weights. Utility weights of 0.5 for both TOX and REL, that is, counting 2 days of TOX or REL as 1 day of TWiST, resulted in a 7-week difference in quality-adjusted survival favouring combination therapy (P=0.0013). The Q-TWiST difference is clinically meaningful and was statistically significant across an entire matrix of possible utility weights. Results were robust in sensitivity analyses. An analysis with utilities based on EQ-5D scores was consistent with the above findings. Combination therapy of lapatinib with capecitabine resulted in greater quality-adjusted survival than capecitabine monotherapy in trastuzumab-refractory MBC patients.",0
A randomized trial comparing ftorafur alone with ftorafur plus tamoxifen in postoperative adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. Kinki Area Research Group for Postoperative Adjuvant Therapy for Breast Cancer.,"A randomized study was performed in 35 centers in the Kinki area of Japan to determine the effectiveness of ftrorafur (FT) plus tamoxifen (TAM) compared with FT monotherapy in postoperative adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. Patients were randomized by the envelope method to receive either FT 600 mg/day or FT 600 mg/day plus TAM 20 mg/day orally for 1 year, starting on day 7 after mastectomy. Between April 1982 and January 1985, 628 patients were assigned to treatment with FT alone and 626 to treatment with FT + TAM. Of these, 571 (90.9%) and 539 (86.1%) patients, respectively, met the eligibility requirements for this study. There were no significant differences in major background factors between the two groups of eligible patients. Five-year survival rates were 91.4% for FT alone and 91.1% for FT+TAM (not significantly different). Five-year disease-free survival rates showed a tendency towards a better prognosis (P = 0.090) in the FT + TAM group, with observed rates of 83.0% for FT alone and 86.7% for FT + TAM. Stratified analysis showed that disease-free survival with FT + TAM is better than with FT alone for patients aged 50 years or more ( P = 0.048) and for patients with from one to three positive nodes (P = 0.064).",1
Randomized trial of tamoxifen alone or combined with fluoxymesterone as adjuvant therapy in postmenopausal women with resected estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. North Central Cancer Treatment Group Trial 89-30-52.,"PURPOSE: This clinical trial evaluated the addition of fluoxymesterone (Flu) to tamoxifen (Tam) in women with resected early stage breast cancer and attempted to corroborate the findings of superiority for the combination over Tam alone seen in a previous randomized trial in metastatic disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Postmenopausal women with early stage breast cancer that was known to be estrogen receptor (ER) positive were randomized to treatment with Tam (20 mg per day orally for 5 years) alone or combined with Flu (10 mg orally twice per day for 1 year). The primary endpoint was relapse-free survival (RFS) defined as local-regional or distant recurrence including ductal carcinoma in situ of the ipsilateral, but not contralateral breast, and death from any cause. RESULTS: There were 541 eligible patients entered between 1991 and 1995 and the treatment arms were balanced with respect to patient characteristics. The median follow up of patients still alive was 11.4 years. No significant difference was found between Tam plus Flu and Tam alone in terms of RFS or overall survival. The adjusted hazard ratio (Tam+Flu/Tam) for relapse or death without relapse was estimated to be 0.84 (95% CI: 0.64-1.10) and that for death was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.67-1.18). As expected there was more virilization in women who received Flu. CONCLUSIONS: This clinical trial did not demonstrate superiority of Tam plus Flu over Tam alone as adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal women with resected early breast cancer known to be ER positive.",1
An evaluation of early or delayed adjuvant chemotherapy in premenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer undergoing oophorectomy.,"We treated randomly 75 premenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer with combination chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide and prednisone), either as an early adjunct to oophorectomy or as a delayed treatment upon appearance of progressive metastatic disease after operation. The group receiving early systemic chemotherapy enjoyed an improved response rate, an improved survival rate and, most importantly, an improved progression-free interval (median of 53 versus 17 weeks). With the exclusion of the group with early (within three weeks after oophorectomy) progression, the progression-free intervals had a median duration of 77 weeks in the early-treatment group versus 33 weeks in the control group. The early-progression group did exceedingly poorly, although systemic chemotherapy was employed at that juncture, having a median survival of 22 weeks as compared to 144 weeks in the immediate-treatment group and 105 weeks in the control group.",0
A clinical trial of homoharringtonine in the treatment of advanced breast cancer.,"Two combination chemotherapy protocols, CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil) and CMFH (CMF plus homoharringtonine), were tested in advanced breast cancer patients. The response rate of CMF was 50% in 44 cases, and that of CMFH was 54.16% in 48 cases; the difference was not significant. There was also no difference between the median duration of response and the median survival of the two protocols. It was concluded that the addition of homoharringtonine to the CMF protocol gave no additional benefit.",1
Femoral fractures in postmenopausal breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen.,"The anti-estrogen tamoxifen is the prevalent endocrine treatment in postmenopausal breast cancer patients. However, nothing is known about the long-term effects of the drug on the skeleton as assessed by the occurrence of fractures. We investigated the occurrence of fractures of the femur in patients from a Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (DBCG) trial initiated in 1977 by a linkage of data from the Danish National Registry of Patients with data from the DBCG registry. 1716 postmenopausal women with high-risk breast cancer were randomized to local radiotherapy with or without tamoxifen, 30 mg daily for 1 year. Fifty-one patients in the control group had one femoral fracture and 64 tamoxifen treated patients had one femoral fracture. Eleven patients in the control group had one trochanteric fracture compared to 27 patients in the tamoxifen group (logrank = 5.28. P = 0.022; hazard ratio = 2.12, 95% CL 1.12, 4.01). The results could not be explained by a longer survival in the tamoxifen group nor by bone metastases with pathological fractures. In conclusion, our study suggests that tamoxifen does not seem to offer protection against fractures in old age and may even increase the risk of fractures at particular sites. This hypothesis needs to be disproved or confirmed in other trials.",0
Combined androgen and antimetabolite therapy of advanced female breast cancer. A report of the cooperative breast cancer group.,"A clinical trial of androgen and antimetabolite therapy of advanced female breast cancer was conducted in 110 patients by the Cooperative Breast Cancer Group. An objective regression rate of 20% was achieved in women receiving oral testolactone, 6% in patients given intravenous fluorouracil alone, and 14% when the androgen and antimetabolite were administered together. This randomized trial according to the CBCG protocol did not produce the high regression rate noted previously in a nonrandomized, nonprotocol evaluation of these drugs.",0
A statistical solution to an ethical problem.,,0
Factors associated with return to work after breast cancer treatment.,"Relatively few studies have addressed problems regarding return to work after primary treatment for early-stage breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether socio-economic and treatment-related factors were associated with problems of returning to work among pre-menopausal women included in a randomized trial of adjuvant endocrine therapy. The duration of all endocrine treatments in the trial was two years. At 24 months after randomization 35 of the 222 recurrence-free patients (16%) had not returned to work. The use of adjuvant endocrine therapy was associated with a twofold increase in the odds ratio of not having returned to work, although the confidence interval of this ratio was wide and included unity. Tumour stage was negatively associated with work status, possibly because of its association with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy to the regional nodes. Age and investigated social factors (educational level, matrimonial status and presence of under-age children) were not significantly associated with return to work. Determining the significance of other social factors such as vocational motivation, level of income and vocational rehabilitation merits further research.",0
Randomized placebo-controlled study of recombinant human interleukin-11 to prevent chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia in patients with breast cancer receiving dose-intensive cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin.,"PURPOSE: Thrombocytopenia may compromise cancer treatment, causing chemotherapy dose reductions, schedule alterations, or the need for platelet transfusions. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of recombinant human interleukin-11 (rhIL-11; Neumega, Genetics Institute, Inc, Cambridge, MA), a novel thrombopoietic growth factor, in reducing the need for platelet transfusions in patients who undergo dose-intensive chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women with advanced breast cancer received cyclophosphamide (3,200 mg/m2) and doxorubicin (75 mg/m2) plus granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; 5 microg/kg/d). Patients were randomized to blinded treatment with placebo or 50 microg/kg/d rhIL-11 subcutaneously for 10 or 17 days after the first two chemotherapy cycles. RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients were randomized and constitute the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Sixty-seven patients (the assessable subgroup) either completed both cycles without a major protocol violation (n = 62) or received a platelet transfusion before treatment was discontinued after the first cycle. In the ITT population, rhIL-11 significantly decreased the requirement for platelet transfusions; 27 of 40 (68%) patients who received rhIL-11 did not require transfusions, compared with 15 of 37 (41%) in the placebo group (P = .04). Treatment with rhIL-11 significantly reduced the total number of platelet transfusions required in the assessable subgroup (P = .03) and the time to platelet recovery to more than 50,000/microL in the second cycle (P = .01). Most adverse events associated with rhIL-11 were reversible, mild to moderate in severity, and likely related to fluid retention. CONCLUSION: rhIL-11 is safe and effective in reducing treatment-associated thrombocytopenia and the need for platelet transfusions in patients who undergo dose-intensive chemotherapy, and thus may permit chemotherapy to be administered as planned at intended doses and thereby maximize the potential for a successful outcome.",0
Immunochemotherapy of breast cancer with Propionibacterium granulosum.,"Eighty-two patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, and 5-fluorouracil (FAC). These patients were divided by randomization into two groups. One was receiving cytostatic drugs only, while another received the identical cytostatic medication plus additional therapy consisting of IV infusions of gamma-radiation-sterilized cells of Propionibacterium granulosum strain KP-45. Metastases were localized in six different sites and/or organs. Multiple parameters for monitoring changes in metastatic lesions and laboratory tests were performed serially in all patients. The addition of P. granulosum to standard (FAC) chemotherapy of metastatic breast cancer influenced metastases in the liver. It also resulted in increased survival time within the observation period. Possible mechanisms of immunomodulating activity of P. granulosum in this disease are discussed.",0
"Phase III randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of risedronate for the prevention of bone loss in premenopausal women undergoing chemotherapy for primary breast cancer.","PURPOSE: Risedronate prevents bone loss in postmenopausal women. The purpose of this study was to determine whether risedronate prevents bone loss in premenopausal women undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Premenopausal women undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer were treated with oral calcium 600 mg and vitamin D 400 U daily and randomly assigned to receive oral risedronate 35 mg weekly or placebo, with all these therapies beginning within a month of the start of chemotherapy. Most chemotherapy regimens included anthracyclines, taxanes, or cyclophosphamide. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured at baseline and 1 year. The primary end point was the change in lumbar spine (LS) BMD from baseline to 1 year.RESULTS: A total of 216 women enrolled; 170 women provided BMD data at 1 year. There was no difference in the mean change or percent change in LS BMD between groups, with a loss of 4.3% in the risedronate arm and 5.4% for placebo at 1 year (P = .18). Loss of BMD at the femoral neck and total hip were also similar between treatment groups. Risedronate was well tolerated, with no significant differences in adverse events compared with placebo, except that arthralgias and chest pain were worse in those receiving the placebos.CONCLUSION: Risedronate did not prevent bone loss in premenopausal women undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.",0
A phase I/II trial of a polysaccharide extract from Grifola frondosa (Maitake mushroom) in breast cancer patients: immunological effects.,"BACKGROUND: Cancer patients commonly use dietary supplements to ""boost immune function"". A polysaccharide extract from Grifola frondosa (Maitake extract) showed immunomodulatory effects in preclinical studies and therefore the potential for clinical use. Whether oral administration in human produces measurable immunologic effects, however, is unknown. METHODS: In a phase I/II dose escalation trial, 34 postmenopausal breast cancer patients, free of disease after initial treatment, were enrolled sequentially in five cohorts. Maitake liquid extract was taken orally at 0.1, 0.5, 1.5, 3, or 5 mg/kg twice daily for 3 weeks. Peripheral blood was collected at days -7, 0 (prior to the first dosing), 7, 14, and 21 for ex vivo analyses. The primary endpoints were safety and tolerability. RESULTS: No dose-limiting toxicity was encountered. Two patients withdrew prior to completion of the study due to grade I possibly related side effects: nausea and joint swelling in one patient; rash and pruritus in the second. There was a statistically significant association between Maitake and immunologic function (p < 0.0005). Increasing doses of Maitake increased some immunologic parameters and depressed others; the dose-response curves for many endpoints were non-monotonic with intermediate doses having either immune enhancing or immune suppressant effects compared with both high and low doses. CONCLUSIONS: Oral administration of a polysaccharide extract from Maitake mushroom is associated with both immunologically stimulatory and inhibitory measurable effects in peripheral blood. Cancer patients should be made aware of the fact that botanical agents produce more complex effects than assumed, and may depress as well as enhance immune function.",0
Comparison of rapidly cycled tandem high-dose chemotherapy plus peripheral-blood stem-cell support versus dose-dense conventional chemotherapy for adjuvant treatment of high-risk breast cancer: results of a multicentre phase III trial.,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer with extensive axillary-lymph-node involvement has a poor prognosis after conventional treatment. In trials with historical controls, high-dose chemotherapy produced improved outcomes. We compared an intensive double-cycle high-dose chemotherapy regimen with an accelerated conventionally dosed regimen in high-risk breast cancer in a multicentre trial. METHODS: Patients with at least nine positive nodes were randomly assigned either two courses of accelerated (2-week intervals, with filgrastim support), conventionally dosed epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by two courses of high-dose chemotherapy (epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, and thiotepa supported by peripheral-blood progenitors) or four identical cycles of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by three cycles of accelerated cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil. The primary endpoint was event-free survival. Analyses were done both by intention to treat and per protocol. FINDINGS: 403 patients were enrolled; 201 were assigned high-dose chemotherapy and 202 conventional treatment. The mean number of positive nodes was 17.6, and median follow-up was 48.6 months. 4-year event-free survival (intention-to-treat analysis) was 60% (95% CI 53-67) in the high-dose chemotherapy group and 44% (37-52) in the control group (p=0.00069). The corresponding overall survival was 75% (69-82) versus 70% (64-77; p=0.02). There were no treatment-related deaths. INTERPRETATION: Our finding of significant improvements in both event-free and overall survival for high-dose chemotherapy compared with a dose-dense conventional regimen contrasts with the results of other studies. The discrepancy might be due partly to design differences (tandem, brief induction) between our regimen and those studied in other trials. This approach merits further study.",1
Five-year administration of fenretinide: pharmacokinetics and effects on plasma retinol concentrations.,"PURPOSE: Monitoring of fenretinide (4HPR) levels, kinetics, and effects on retinal was performed in patients who participated in a phase I trial and who continued to be treated for 5 years as phase III trial patients. Accumulation of 4HPR in the breast was also assessed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Plasma concentrations of 4HPR, of its main metabolite N-(4-methoxyphenyl)retinamide (4MPR), and of retinol were assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in breast cancer patients treated orally with 4HPR 200 mg/d for 5 years with a 3-day drug interruption at the end of each month. RESULTS: 4HPR, at 200 mg/d, resulted in average 4HPR plasma levels of approximately 1 mumol/L, which remained steady and caused steady retinol level reduction; 4MPR levels, similar to those of 4HPR, slightly but significantly increased during the first 35 months, but at 5 years they were similar to those at 5 months. During daily treatment, baseline retinol concentrations were reduced by 71%; after a 3-day drug interruption, all patients recovered and the mean reduction was 38%. After discontinuation of 5-year treatment, 4HPR and 4MPR half-lives (t1/2 beta) were 27 and 54 hours, respectively, similar to those reported after 28 daily treatments. After 6 and 12 months, the concentrations of 4HPR were at the limit of detectability (0.01 mumol/L), whereas those of 4MPR were five times higher. Baseline retinol concentrations were already recovered after 1 month. Accumulation of this retinoid in the breast was evidenced by concentrations of 4HPR and 4MPR in nipple discharge and in breast biopsies that were 10 and 20 times higher, respectively, than those found in plasma. CONCLUSION: 4HPR, at 200 mg/d for 5 years, resulted in constant drug plasma levels and constant retinol level reduction. After treatment interruption, 4HPR plasma concentrations decreased at the limit of detectability at 6 months and baseline retinol plasma concentrations were recovered after 1 month.",0
Effects of tamoxifen and toremifene on urinary excretion of pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline and bone density in postmenopausal patients with breast cancer.,"Tamoxifen and toremifene are two mostly used antiestrogens in the treatment of breast cancer. To compare their effect on bone in postmenopausal breast cancer patients we measured the urinary output of two bone resorption markers, pyridinoline (Pyr) and deoxypyridinoline (Dpyr) as well as bone density (BMD) in 30 breast cancer patients using either tamoxifen (20 mg/day, n = 15) or toremifene (40 mg/day, n = 15) as adjuvant treatment of stage II breast cancer for 1 year. The urinary output of Pyr and Dpyr were assessed before and after 6 and 12 months of the antiestrogen regimen. Lumbar and femoral BMD were measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) before and after 12 months of treatment. Both tamoxifen and toremifene were associated with significant decreases in Pyr (mean fall 19.6% and 12.6%, respectively) and Dpyr (mean fall 21.6% and 15.5%, respectively) at 6 months. After 12 months' treatment, Pyr decreased by 30.8% and Dpyr by 21.2% in women using tamoxifen and significantly less in women using toremifene (10.1% and 4.9%, respectively). BMD in the lumbar spine decreased by 1.8% in the toremifene group but increased by 0.4% in the tamoxifen group; in the proximal femur, BMD increased slightly during both tamoxifen and toremifene treatment in all sites measured. Individual changes in Pyr and Dpyr at 6 months showed no significant relation to the change in BMD at 12 months. We conclude that tamoxifen (20 mg/day) and toremifene (40 mg/day) reduce the bone resorption similarly, and this can be detected by falls in urinary output of Pyr and Dpyr at 6 months of treatment.",0
Conservative treatment for breast cancer of limited extent. Results of a randomized trial.,"From 1973 to 1980, a controlled clinical trial was carried out at the National Cancer Institute of Milan to compare the Halsted mastectomy with breast quadrantectomy and axillary dissection followed by radiotherapy in patients with breast cancer of less than 2 cm in size. Cases of breast cancer classified as T1N0 were randomized into the two treatment procedures: 349 cases were treated with the Halsted mastectomy and 352 with the quadrantectomy technique. The two series were comparable with regard to age distribution, size, site of primary tumor, menopausal status and frequency of axillary metastases. Three local recurrences occurred in the Halsted group and one in the quadrantectomy group. Actuarial curves showed no difference in the two series with regard to disease-free and overall survival. In view of these results, mastectomy appears to be an unnecessary mutilation for patients with breast carcinomas less than 2 cm in size and no palpable axillary nodes.",0
"Lack of association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in pregnane X receptor, hepatic nuclear factor 4alpha, and constitutive androstane receptor with docetaxel pharmacokinetics.","PURPOSE: This study aims to describe a population pharmacokinetic model for docetaxel in Asian breast cancer patients and to evaluate the effects of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) gene expression regulators, constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), pregnane X receptor (PXR), and hepatic nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha), on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Docetaxel was given as an i.v. infusion of 75 mg/m(2) over 1 h to 101 female breast cancer patients. CAR, PXR, and HNF4alpha were comprehensively sequenced. Docetaxel concentrations were measured using a liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method and its population pharmacokinetic variables, and the covariate effects of clearance predictors were estimated using a nonlinear mixed effects model.RESULTS: Final estimates for docetaxel clearance was 47.1 L/h/70 kg/1.75 m. Between subject variability in docetaxel clearance was 22.5%. Covariates that showed significant association with docetaxel clearance included body size, alpha1 acid glycoprotein and liver function. SNPs identified in the coding regions of CAR and HNF4alpha and 5' untranslated region of PXR in this Asian breast cancer cohort did not seem to improve predictability of docetaxel clearance.CONCLUSIONS: SNPs identified in CYP3A gene expression regulators CAR, HNF4alpha, and PXR in the Asian female breast cancer population do not seem to have any significant effect on the clearance of docetaxel, a CYP3A substrate.",0
Attitudes toward information about genetic risk for cognitive impairment after cancer chemotherapy: breast cancer survivors compared with healthy controls.,"PURPOSE: The trend toward personalized medicine will involve cancer treatment increasingly being tailored to the genetic characteristics of individuals. However, the availability of genetic information does not imply this information is desired or would impact treatment decision making.METHODS: One hundred sixty breast cancer survivors (BC group) and 205 healthy controls (HC group) were randomly assigned to respond to two different clinical scenarios varying in genetic-related risk of cognitive impairment (CI; little v very likely) and severity of CI (little v moderate problem) after chemotherapy. Ratings of the importance of being told this genetic information (information importance) and the likelihood this information would affect their decision to receive chemotherapy (information impact) were obtained.RESULTS: Results indicated the importance ascribed to genetic information was greatest when CI likelihood and severity were both high or low (P < .05). Information impact ratings were not sensitive to differences in CI likelihood or severity; the BC group was less likely to indicate genetic information would affect their decision to receive chemotherapy than the HC group (P < .001).CONCLUSION: Results suggest lessened enthusiasm for genetic information that maintains or increases uncertainty about a specific course of action and highlight the importance of including clinically relevant groups in treatment decision-making research that employs hypothetical scenarios. Although women generally believe it is important to receive genetic information, they might benefit from assistance (eg, decision aid) in the difficult task of integrating information about survival and risk for adverse late effects from cancer treatment.",0
Therapeutic effect of tamoxifen versus tamoxifen combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate in advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women.,"Postmenopausal patients, those less than 68 years of age resistant to chemotherapy and those greater than 68 years of age with or without resistance to chemotherapy, entered this trial. Among 101 eligible patients, 46 were randomized to treatment with tamoxifen at a dose of 10 mg 3 times daily and 55 were randomized to treatment with tamoxifen at a dose of 10 mg 3 times daily plus medroxyprogesterone acetate at a dose of 100 mg once daily. Remission (partial plus complete) was obtained in 20 patients (45%) with tamoxifen compared to 14 patients (26%) with tamoxifen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate; however, this difference is not significantly different. The median duration of remission was also not significantly different between the two treatments: 10 months for the single drug compared with 9 months for the combined treatment. Response rates correlated with the presence of estrogen receptor, with no differences between the two treatment groups. Side effects occurred in 12 patients and in only one patient did they cause discontinuation of treatment. In conclusion, these results and theoretic considerations indicate that combined treatment with tamoxifen and medroxyprogesterone acetate is not better than treatment with tamoxifen alone.",0
"A randomized, placebo-controlled trial (NCIC CTG MAP1) examining the effects of letrozole on mammographic breast density and other end organs in postmenopausal women.","Mammographically detected breast density has been correlated with breast cancer risk. Breast density appears to be influenced by hormonal factors including increasing age, postmenopausal status, number of pregnancies, lower body weight, hormone replacement therapy, and tamoxifen therapy. The aromatase inhibitor letrozole profoundly reduces breast and circulating estrogen levels in postmenopausal women. We hypothesize that letrozole may reduce breast density and report here on its effects on mammographic breast density, bone mineral density (BMD), bone biomarkers, plasma hormone, and serum lipid levels. MAP1 was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, feasibility trial in which postmenopausal women with or without prior invasive breast cancer were randomized in a 2:1 ratio of letrozole (2.5 mg daily) or placebo for 12 months and followed for a total of 24 months. Eligible women had an estimated >25% breast density on baseline mammogram. The primary endpoint was change in percent breast density (PD) between the baseline and 12-month mammograms as estimated by a computer-assisted thresholding program. Baseline and 12-month mammographic density was also assessed in a blinded manner by visual inspection. Secondary endpoints included changes in serum hormones, plasma lipid levels, bone biomarkers, and BMD. Data are available for 67 women (44 on letrozole and 23 on placebo). No significant changes in PD were noted between the treatment arms at either 12 or 24 months. No distinguishable difference in density measurements by visual inspection were noted between baseline and 12-month mammograms. A significant decrease in percentage change in T-score of the femoral neck at 12 months was noted in the letrozole arm without other significant changes in BMD parameters. Lipid values did not differ between treatment groups except for a borderline significant decrease in total cholesterol at 3 months among women treated with letrozole. Letrozole therapy was associated with a significant reduction in mean serum estradiol, estrone, and estrone sulfate levels at 12 months, but not at 24 months. A significant increase in serum IGF-1 levels was also noted in the letrozole group compared to the placebo group at both 12 and 24 months. To conclude, compared with placebo, 12 months of letrozole therapy does not appear to have a significant effect on mammographic PD. Twelve months of letrozole was associated with a decrease of uncertain clinical significance in the T-score of the femoral neck at 12 months which was reversible at 24 months with recovery of estrogen levels. Letrozole therapy was found to increase IGF-1 levels at 12 and 24 months.",0
"Prognostic significance of mutations in the p53 gene, particularly in the zinc-binding domains, in lymph node- and steroid receptor positive breast cancer patients. Austrian Breast Cancer Study Group.","The aim of our study was to evaluate if p53 mutations, especially those in the L2/L3 domains of the p53 gene, add prognostic information for node-positive and steroid receptor positive breast cancer patients. Two hundred and five tumour samples from a randomised clinical trial of 596 lymph node- and steroid receptor positive breast cancer patients were included. All patients had been randomly allocated to receive 20 mg of adjuvant tamoxifen (TAM) daily for 2 years or TAM plus one cycle of low-dose, short-term chemotherapy. For detection of p53 mutations we used in vitro amplification by polymerase chain reaction and consecutively performed temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-TGGE) and direct sequencing. We found p53 mutations in 42/205 (20%) cases: 16/42 (38%) p53 mutations occurred within the L2/L3 domains of the p53 gene, and 26/42 (62%) outside the L2/L3 domains. p53 mutation served as a statistically significant parameter in predicting disease-free survival in univariate (P = 0.02) and multivariate (P = 0.009) analysis. For overall survival, no significant differences were observed. Patients with tumours that had p53 mutations within the L2/L3 domains of the gene showed no significant difference to those with mutations outside the L2/L3 domains for disease-free survival. For overall survival, mutations in the L2/L3 domains showed a marginally significant difference (P = 0.05) in multivariate analysis, but not in univariate analysis (P = 0.13). We conclude that mutation in the L2/L3 domains of the p53 gene is not an independent prognostic indicator of disease outcome for patients suffering from breast cancer with lymph node metastases and positive steroid receptors.",0
Anxiety and sedation during a stressful situation after single dose of diazepam versus N-desmethyldiazepam--a controlled trial.,"Twenty milligram diazepam (DZ) was compared with 20 mg of its main metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam (NDDZ) as single dose, oral premedication in a genuine stressful situation. Fifty patients participated in the randomized, double-blind controlled study. Anxiety and sedation were measured the day before an operation and one hour after premedication, just before the operation. NDDZ was significantly less sedative while the degree of anxiety was rated equal in the two groups. The results may support the hypothesis that a competition between DZ and NDDZ can explain the shift in the effect profile of DZ during long term treatment.",0
Effects of toremifene and tamoxifen on lipid profiles in post-menopausal patients with early breast cancer: interim results from a Japanese phase III trial.,"OBJECTIVE: Toremifene and tamoxifen have been used for adjuvant therapy in post-menopausal patients with breast cancer in Japan. Dyslipidemias are common in post-menopausal women. However, limited data are available on the effects of these agents on lipid profiles in Japanese patients. The Japan Toremifene Cooperative Study Group has been conducting a Phase III randomized trial of post-menopausal patients with breast cancer. One of its secondary endpoints is to confirm the effects of these agents on serum lipid profiles. METHODS: The subjects were post-menopausal Japanese patients who had undergone surgery for early breast cancer. Toremifene or tamoxifen was administered for 2 years. Lipid levels were measured before and up to 24 months after initiation. RESULTS: Compared with baseline, at 24 months, the toremifene group (n = 123) showed significantly decreased total cholesterol (P < 0.001) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (P < 0.001), and significantly increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (P < 0.001). Their triglyceride levels were not affected (P = 0.677). The tamoxifen group (n = 120) also showed significantly decreased total cholesterol (P < 0.001) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (P < 0.001); no significant changes occurred in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 0.297) or triglyceride levels (P = 0.120). CONCLUSIONS: Distinct differences between two selective estrogen receptor modulators on lipids were observed. Toremifene improved lipid profiles, particularly as an enhancer of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. To a large extent, tamoxifen improved low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The impact of these improved lipid profiles on the risk of cardiovascular diseases needs further confirmation.",0
"Randomized trial of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil chemotherapy added to tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy in postmenopausal women with node-positive estrogen and/or progesterone receptor-positive breast cancer: a report of the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group. Breast Cancer Site Group.","PURPOSE AND METHODS: By the mid 1980s, tamoxifen alone was considered standard adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal women with node-positive, estrogen receptor (ER)- or progesterone receptor (PgR)-positive breast cancer. From 1984 through 1990, 705 eligible postmenopausal women with node-positive, ER- or PgR-positive breast cancer were randomized to a National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group (NCIC CTG) study that compared tamoxifen 30 mg by mouth daily for 2 years (TAM) versus TAM plus chemotherapy with all-intravenous cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2, methotrexate 40 mg/m2, and fluorouracil 600 mg/m2 given every 21 days for eight cycles (CMF). RESULTS: There were no significant differences in overall survival, recurrence-free survival, locoregional recurrence-free survival, or distant recurrence-free survival between the two treatment arms. However, there was significantly greater severe toxicity, which included leukopenia (P < .0001), nausea and vomiting (P < .0001), and thromboembolic events (P < .0001), as well as significantly more mild or greater toxicity, which included thrombocytopenia (P = .04), anemia (P = .02), infection (P = .0004), mucositis (P = .0001), diarrhea (P = .0001), and neurologic toxicity (P = .006), in women who received TAM plus CMF. CONCLUSION: The addition of CMF to TAM adds no benefit and considerable toxicity in this group of women.",1
Women's interest in taking tamoxifen and raloxifene for breast cancer prevention: response to a tailored decision aid.,"Although tamoxifen can prevent primary breast cancer, few women use it as a preventive measure. A second option, raloxifene, has recently been approved. The objective of the study was to determine women's interest in tamoxifen and raloxifene after reading a decision aid (DA) describing the risks and benefits of each medication. Women with 5-year risk of breast cancer ≥ 1.66 from two large health maintenance organizations were randomized to receive a DA versus usual care. After reading an on-line DA that discussed the risks and benefits of tamoxifen and raloxifene, women completed measures of risk perception, decisional conflict, behavioral intentions, and actual behavior related to tamoxifen and raloxifene. 3 months following the intervention, 8.1% of participants had looked for additional information about breast cancer prevention drugs, and 1.8% had talked to their doctor about tamoxifen and/or raloxifene. The majority, 54.7%, had decided to not take either drug, 0.5% had started raloxifene, and none had started tamoxifen. Participants were not particularly worried about taking tamoxifen or raloxifene and did not perceive significant benefits from taking these drugs. Over 50% did not perceive a change in their risk of getting breast cancer if they took tamoxifen or raloxifene. After reading a DA about tamoxifen and raloxifene, few women were interested in taking either breast cancer prevention drug.",0
"Comparison of testosterone decanoate, drostanolone and testololactone in disseminated breast cancer--a randomized clinical study.","It can be said that a single hormone therapy with testosterone decanoate, drostanolone, and testosterone gave similar rates of objective responses in metastatic breast cancer. The presented randomized study has been done to prove whether an additional chemotherapy to hormone applications would further improve therapeutic results. During an observation period of 10 to 16 weeks testosterone decanoate and testolactone in combination with cyclophosphamide have more benefitial effects on the patients than drostanolone plus cyclophosphamide. The combination therapy augmented the rate of objective responses from 22-25 percent to 46-55 percent.",0
1-phenylalanine mustard (L-PAM) in the management of premenopausal patients with primary breast cancer: lack of association of disease-free survival with depression of ovarian function. National Surgical Adjuvant Project for Breast and Bowel Cancers.,"Breast cancer patients participating in a prospective randomized clinical trial who were less than or equal to 49 years of age, had positive axillary nodes, and who received prolonged 1-phenylalanine mustard (L-PAM) as an adjuvant to mastectomy continue (after 4 years) to demonstrate a significantly greater disease-free survival (p = .007) than do patients who received placebo. Benefit was achieved in patients who were less than or equal to 39 years as well as those who were 40-49 years of age. Those in the younger age group showed a greater improvement in disease-free survival at 4 years relative to their controls (32% vs. 69%; p = .01) than did those in the older age group (48% vs. 61%; p = .09). When patients were examined relative to their nodal status, a highly favorable effect was found to have been achieved with L-PAM in those with 1-3 positive nodes (54% vs. 86%; p = .006). Results indicate that both age groups were benefited. When considered over time, they demonstrate that a relatively greater effect was achieved in the younger women. While L-PAM failed to significantly alter the disease-free survival of those with greater than or equal to 4 positive nodes a slightly better effect was achieved in the group less than or equal to 39 years. Since adjuvant chemotherapy has been found to be more effective in premenopausal than postmenopausal women, it has been presumed that decreased ovarian function, as a result of the chemotherapy, is responsible for the findings. To support or repudiate that concept, information regarding serum levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and estradiol (E2), as well as menstrual function, has been obtained from women receiving L-PAM or L-PAM plus 5-FU therapy. In contrast to findings relative to disease-free survival, ovarian function and menses were most affected in patients 40-49 years of age. Amenorrhea occurred in 73% of patients in that age group and in only 22% of those less than or equal to 39 years (p less than .001). Similarly, a significant increase in LH and FSH and a decrease in E2, all indicative of ovarian suppression, was observed only in the older group of patients. Thus, it is concluded that while ovarian suppression may account for some of the adjuvant chemotherapeutic effect in premenopausal women, the dichotomy of findings in younger and older premenopausal women relative to therapeutic response and ovarian function indicates that other factors could be responsible.",0
Phase I study of percutaneous 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen with analyses of 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen concentrations in breast cancer and normal breast tissue.,"4-OH-tamoxifen is an active metabolite of tamoxifen that is detectable in the serum and tumour tissue of patients treated by oral tamoxifen. As this metabolite penetrates through the skin, it is possible to compare percutaneous 4-OH-tamoxifen (4-OH-TAM) and oral tamoxifen treatments. We report herein a randomized study of percutaneous 4-OH-TAM versus oral tamoxifen in women with breast cancer. This pharmacology study was designed to compare the 4-OH-TAM concentration in breast cancer and normal breast tissue according to the route and dose used for administration of tamoxifen after a 3-week period prior to surgery and tissue sampling. Women were randomized into one of the five following groups: group I, oral tamoxifen given at 10 mg twice a day; group II, 4-OH-TAM delivered percutaneously at 0.5 mg day to both breast areas; group III, 4-OH-TAM applied percutaneously at 1 mg/day to both breast areas; group IV, 4-OH-TAM delivered percutaneously at 1 mg/day to a large cutaneous area excluding the breasts; and group V, 4-OH-TAM applied percutaneously at 2 mg/day to a large skin area excluding the breasts. 4-OH-TAM plasma and tissue concentrations were significantly higher in the oral tamoxifen group as compared with either the high- or the low-dose percutaneous 4-OH-TAM group. In group II, percutaneous 4-OH-TAM treatment resulted in tissue concentrations of 1,446 and 352 pg/g in tumour tissue and normal breast tissue, respectively. In group I these concentrations were as follows: tumour tissue, 12, 453 pg/g; and normal tissue, 10,214 pg/g. 4-OH-TAM concentrations in tumour tissue and normal breast tissue did not significantly differ in any group. In the oral group we observed classic effects on coagulation and lipid metabolism when pre- and post-treatment values of these biological variables were compared, whereas no difference was observed in the percutaneous group. Although percutaneous administration of 4-OH-TAM led to a low plasmatic concentration of this active metabolite, the breast tissue concentration remained lower than those observed after oral tamoxifen treatment. Therefore, at the doses described in this study, percutaneous 4-OH-TAM cannot be proposed as an alternative tamoxifen treatment.",1
Capecitabine combined with weekly docetaxel in Chinese patients > 65 years with anthracycline-resistant metastatic breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: There are no data on more tolerable capecitabine doses in elderly patients in Chinese population. The aim of this study was to evaluate the activity and safety of capecitabine combined with weekly docetaxel for the treatment of anthracycline-resistant metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in older Chinese patients.METHODS: MBC patients aged > 65 years pretreated with 1 - 5 prior chemotherapy regimens, including an anthracycline, received oral capecitabine 825 mg/m(2) twice daily, days 1 - 14, plus docetaxel 30 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8 every 21 days. All 41 enrolled patients received at least 1 dose of treatment and were evaluable for safety; 38 received at least 2 cycles (median 4, range 2 - 8) and were evaluable for efficacy.RESULTS: The overall objective response rate was 47%, including complete responses in 8% of patients. Median time to progression was 8.9 months. Median overall survival was 17.6 months. The most common side effects were haematological and gastrointestinal toxicities and hand-foot syndrome. The only grade 3/4 adverse events were neutropenia (12%), alopecia (7%), grade 3 nausea and vomiting (2%) and grade 3 nail toxicity (2%).CONCLUSIONS: Capecitabine 825 mg/m(2) twice daily plus weekly docetaxel is active with an acceptable safety profile in Chinese women > 65 years with anthracycline-resistant MBC. Efficacy and tolerability compare favourably with previously reported trials evaluating higher capecitabine doses in combination with 3-weekly or weekly docetaxel.",1
Twelve-year mortality results of a randomized trial of 2 versus 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen for postmenopausal early-stage breast carcinoma patients (SITAM 01).,"BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the impact on overall survival (OS) of 2 versus 5 years adjuvant tamoxifen in early breast carcinoma patients after 12 years of follow-up. METHODS: Women with breast carcinoma T1-3, N0-3, M0, aged 50-70 years, were eligible for this multicenter randomized Phase III trial. Patients event-free after 2 years of tamoxifen therapy (TAM) were randomly assigned to stop or continue TAM (20 mg/day) for an additional 3 years. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival. Secondary endpoints included OS and toxicity. RESULTS: From 1989 through 1996, 1901 patients were randomly assigned either to stop treatment (n = 958) or to continue TAM (n = 943). Overall, 98% of patients alive at the previous report (n = 1611) had updated information about OS, of whom 549 had died. The median duration of postrandomization follow-up was 115 months (interquartile range, 86-137). No statistically significant differences between the two arms were detected in the whole population (hazard ratio [HR], 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86-1.22) and in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive patients (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.72-1.13). In the latter group, survival curves started to diverge after 90 months, showing a trend in favor of the 5-year arm. In younger (age < or =55 yrs) ER-positive patients longer TAM was associated with a 44% decrease in the risk of death (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.31-1.00), while no clear benefit was documented in women older than 55 years of age (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.77-1.25). CONCLUSIONS: The benefits of longer TAM on OS start to emerge only after 9 years from diagnosis and seem to be more relevant in younger ER-positive women.",1
Cyclin A is a prognostic indicator in early stage breast cancer with and without tamoxifen treatment.,"Overexpression of G1-S regulators cyclin D1 or cyclin A is frequently observed in breast cancer and is also to result in ligand-independent activation of oestrogen receptor in vitro. This might therefore, provide a mechanism for failure of tamoxifen treatment. We examined by immunohistochemical staining the effect of deregulation of these, and other cell cycle regulators on tamoxifen treatment in a group of 394 patients with early stage breast cancer. In univariate analysis, expression of cyclin A, Neu, Ki-67 index, and lack of OR expression were significantly associated with worse prognosis. When adjusted by the clinical model (for lymph node status, age, performance status, T-classification, grade, prior surgery, oestrogen receptor status and tamoxifen use), only overexpression of cyclin A and Neu were significantly associated with worse prognosis with hazard ratios of, respectively, 1.709 (P=0.0195) and 1.884 (P=0.0151). Overexpression of cyclin A was found in 86 out of the 201 OR-positive cases treated with tamoxifen, and was the only independent marker associated with worse prognosis (hazard ratio 2.024, P=0.0462). In conclusion, cyclin A is an independent predictor of recurrence of early stage breast cancer and is as such a marker for response in patients treated with tamoxifen.",0

Trastuzumab after adjuvant chemotherapy in HER2-positive breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab, a recombinant monoclonal antibody against HER2, has clinical activity in advanced breast cancer that overexpresses HER2. We investigated its efficacy and safety after excision of early-stage breast cancer and completion of chemotherapy. METHODS: This international, multicenter, randomized trial compared one or two years of trastuzumab given every three weeks with observation in patients with HER2-positive and either node-negative or node-positive breast cancer who had completed locoregional therapy and at least four cycles of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. RESULTS: Data were available for 1694 women randomly assigned to two years of treatment with trastuzumab, 1694 women assigned to one year of trastuzumab, and 1693 women assigned to observation. We report here the results only of treatment with trastuzumab for one year or observation. At the first planned interim analysis (median follow-up of one year), 347 events (recurrence of breast cancer, contralateral breast cancer, second nonbreast malignant disease, or death) were observed: 127 events in the trastuzumab group and 220 in the observation group. The unadjusted hazard ratio for an event in the trastuzumab group, as compared with the observation group, was 0.54 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.43 to 0.67; P<0.0001 by the log-rank test, crossing the interim analysis boundary), representing an absolute benefit in terms of disease-free survival at two years of 8.4 percentage points. Overall survival in the two groups was not significantly different (29 deaths with trastuzumab vs. 37 with observation). Severe cardiotoxicity developed in 0.5 percent of the women who were treated with trastuzumab. CONCLUSIONS: One year of treatment with trastuzumab after adjuvant chemotherapy significantly improves disease-free survival among women with HER2-positive breast cancer.

Serum TIMP-1 and response to the aromatase inhibitor letrozole versus tamoxifen in metastatic breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: To determine the effect of elevated serum TIMP-1 on the response of patients with metastatic breast cancer to an aromatase inhibitor versus tamoxifen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five hundred twenty-two patients estrogen receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive first-line hormone therapy with letrozole or tamoxifen. Serum tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Pretreatment serum TIMP-1 was elevated in 120 (23%) of 522 patients. Patients with elevated serum TIMP-1 had a significantly reduced objective response rate (19.2% v 30.6%; odds ratio, 0.54; P = .01), duration of response (median, 15.5 v 26.2 months; P = .001), time to treatment progression (TTP; median, 4.5 v 9.2 months; HR, 1.78; P = .0001), time to treatment failure (median, 3.5 v 9.0 months; HR, 1.77; P = .0001), and overall survival (median, 20.3 v 35.8 months; HR, 1.77; P = .0001) compared with patients with normal pretreatment TIMP-1 levels. Letrozole was superior to tamoxifen in both the normal serum TIMP-1 group (median TTP, 11.8 v 8.6 months; P = .003) and in the elevated serum TIMP-1 group (median, 6.1 v 3.2 months; P = .03) In multivariate analysis, elevated serum TIMP-1 remained an independent predictor of both shorter TTP (HR, 1.46; P = .002) and survival (HR, 1.44; P = .002), as did serum HER-2. Combined analysis of both serum TIMP-1 and HER-2/neu conferred additional ability to predict significantly different clinical outcomes compared to using either biomarker alone. CONCLUSION: Patients with elevated pretreatment serum TIMP-1 had a significantly reduced response and survival. Serum TIMP-1 was an independent predictive and prognostic factor. Blockade of TIMP-1 and HER-2/neu activity may be beneficial in a subset of patients with breast cancer.",0
Clinical studies of 5-fluorouracil + premarin in the treatment of breast cancer.,"Sixty patients with metastatic or primary inoperable breast cancer not suitable for hormone alteration therapy were blindly randomized between weekly 5-fluorouracil, intravenously, and daily physiologic doses of conjugated estrogens by mouth against weekly 5-fluorouracil, intravenously, and placebo. There was no difference in the survival or the effect on the tumor in the two groups. Numerous factors were analyzed as to their effect on the course of the disease. The number of organ sites of tumor involvement, age of the host, and previous treatment for the disseminated disease were not shown to influence the survival or the results of therapy of either group. However, the duration of the clinical cancer-free period from primary treatment to recurrence, the sites of organ involvement, and the performance status of the patients at the time of entry into the study significantly did influence the survival. There is no evidence in this study that physiologic doses of conjugated estrogens deleteriously influenced the course of the disease.",0
Adjuvant chemotherapy for operable breast cancer in premenopausal women.,"Surgery alone does not cure breast cancer, and adjuvant chemotherapy has changed the management of this disease. Data obtained in 81 premenopausal women with operable breast cancer, treated at our clinic, are presented. Patients with axillary node disease were treated on three different protocols: cyclophosphamide + methotrexate + fluoro-uracil + vincristine + prednisone (CMFVP), cyclophosphamide + methotrexate + fluoro-uracil (CMF), and CMF + immunotherapy with methanol extract residue of BCG (CMF + MER). Patient discriminants and treatment regimens are discussed. Analysis of the results obtained in 49 patients in one study showed an extension of disease-free survival to 4,25 years, that CMFVP was superior to CMF with or without MER, and that immunotherapy was not beneficial. The literature is briefly reviewed and the motivation for our newer studies stated.",0
Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin plus carboplatin in patients with metastatic breast cancer: a phase II study.,"Background We determined the objective response rates produced by pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) plus carboplatin with/without trastuzumab (Herceptin). Patients and methods Patients with measurable disease were stratified by taxane treatment history and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 status. Treatment: PLD 30 mg/m(2) followed by carboplatin, day 1 of each 28-day cycle; human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-positive patients also received trastuzumab. Results Arm 1 received PLD plus carboplatin (N = 41 arm 1a, taxane naive; N = 42 arm 1b, taxane pretreated); Arm 2 patients received PLD plus carboplatin + Herceptin (N = 46). Overall response rates: 31%, 31%, and 56%, respectively. Median overall survival durations were not reached in arm 1a and were 13 and 33 months for arms 1b and 2. Median progression-free survival: 8, 5, 10 months, respectively. Grades 3-4 treatment-related toxic effects for arms 1a, 1b, 2, respectively, were neutropenia 22%, 31%, 35%; thrombocytopenia 34%, 26%, 17%; and fatigue 2%, 14%, 13%. Conclusions PLD plus carboplatin has moderate antitumor activity and excellent tolerability. Herceptin and PLD plus carboplatin in HER2-positive patients have antitumor activity without significant cardiac toxicity. Toxicity results suggest that PLD can be combined with Herceptin with minimal cardiac toxicity.",1
Advanced cognitive training for breast cancer survivors: a randomized controlled trial.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the preliminary efficacy and satisfaction/acceptability of training in memory or speed of processing versus wait-list control for improving cognitive function in breast cancer survivors. 82 breast cancer survivors completed a three-group randomized, controlled trial. Primary outcomes were objective neuropsychological tests of memory and speed of processing. Secondary outcomes were perceived cognitive functioning, symptom distress (mood disturbance, anxiety, and fatigue), quality of life, and intervention satisfaction/acceptability. Data were collected at baseline, post-intervention, and 2-month follow-up. Using repeated-measures mixed-linear ANCOVA models, each intervention was compared to wait-list control while adjusting for age, education, and baseline measures. The effect sizes for differences in means and the reliable improvement percentage were reported. The results show that domain-specific effects were seen for both interventions: memory training improved memory performance at 2-month follow-up (p = 0.036, d = 0.59); speed of processing training improved processing speed post-intervention (p = 0.040, d = 0.55) and 2-month follow-up (p = 0.016; d = 0.67). Transfer effects to non-trained domains were seen for speed of processing training with improved memory post-intervention (p = 0.007, d = 0.75) and 2-month follow-up (p = 0.004, d = 0.82). Both interventions were associated with improvements in perceived cognitive functioning, symptom distress, and quality of life. Ratings of satisfaction/acceptability were high for both interventions. It was concluded that while both interventions appeared promising, speed of processing training resulted in immediate and durable improvements in objective measures of processing speed and verbal memory. Speed of processing training may have broader benefits in this clinical population.",0
A phase 1 study of vinflunine in combination with trastuzumab for the treatment for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the recommended dose (RD) of vinflunine in combination with trastuzumab in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and to investigate potential pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the first part of the study, two dose levels of vinflunine given every 3 weeks were explored (280 and 320 mg/m(2)) combined with trastuzumab (4 mg/kg loading dose and 2 mg/kg weekly). For each level of dose, six patients were enrolled to determine the RD for phase 2 studies (RP2S). In the second part of the study, 18 additional patients at RP2S have been evaluated to confirm safety and investigate preliminary antitumor activity. RESULTS: The RD was 320 mg/m(2) according to the dose escalation plan. Eleven of 15 additional patients who received this dose experienced dose-limiting toxicities, leading to a reduction in the RD to 280 mg/m(2). When compared to prior trials when vinflunine was used as a single agent, neither vinflunine total blood clearance nor trastuzumab serum concentrations were modified when the drugs were combined. All patients were evaluable, and the overall response rate was 73.3 % (95 % CI 54.1-87.7). The median progression-free survival was 11.3 months (95 % CI 9.4-21.0). At the dose of 280 mg/m(2), grade 3-4 neutropenia were seen in 4 patients (44.4 %) without febrile neutropenia. Non-hematologic grade 4 toxicities were not reported while grade 3 peripheral sensory neuropathy concerned 2 patients (22.2 %). CONCLUSION: The RD of vinflunine in combination with the standard regimen of trastuzumab is 280 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks. No mutual PK drug-drug interaction was seen. This regimen appears to be active with a favorable safety profile. Its role in HER2-positive MBC treatment needs to be defined in prospective comparative clinical trials.",1
A Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Primary Tumour Resection Plus Systemic Therapy With Systemic Therapy Alone in Metastatic Breast Cancer (PRIM-BC): Japan Clinical Oncology Group Study JCOG1017.,"This trial is being conducted to confirm the superiority, in terms of overall survival, of primary tumour resection plus systemic therapy to systemic therapy alone in patients with Stage IV breast cancer who are not refractory to primary systemic therapy. The inclusion criteria for the study are as follows: untreated patients with histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer with one or more measurable metastatic lesions diagnosed by radiological examination. All patients receive primary systemic therapy according to the estrogen receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor type-2 status of the primary breast cancer after the first registration. After 3 months, the patients without disease progression are randomized to the primary tumour resection plus systemic therapy arm or the systemic therapy alone arm. The primary endpoint is the overall survival, and the secondary endpoints are proportion of patients without tumour progression at the metastatic sites, yearly local recurrence-free survival, proportion of local ulcer/local bleeding, yearly primary tumour resection-free survival, adverse events of chemotherapy, operative morbidity and serious adverse events. The patient recruitment was commenced in May 2011. Enrolment of 410 patients for randomization is planned over a 5 year recruitment period. We hereby report the details of the study.",0
Phase I Study and Biomarker Analysis of Lapatinib and Concurrent Radiation for Locally Advanced Breast Cancer.,"Purpose. This phase I study assessed the toxicity and safety of combining daily lapatinib with radiation therapy. Sequential tumor biopsies were obtained to evaluate changes in biomarkers, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human EGFR-2 (HER2) signaling pathways.Methods. Eligibility for this dose-escalation study included unresectable and locally recurrent or chemotherapy-refractory and locally advanced breast cancer, and adequate organ function. Patients underwent three serial biopsies: at baseline, after 1 week of lapatinib alone, and after 1 week of lapatinib and radiation. Endpoints included determination of toxicity, maximum tolerated dose, and analysis of the effect of lapatinib with or without radiation on EGFR and HER2 signaling pathways by immunohistochemistry.Results. Doses of lapatinib up to 1,500 mg/day were well tolerated. Toxicity of grade 3 or more was limited to radiation dermatitis and pain. Out of 19 patients treated, in field responses per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria were complete in four patients and partial in six patients. Serial biopsies were obtained in 16 patients with no complications. Total Her2 was relatively unchanged while phospho-Her2, phospho-Akt, and phospho-ERK showed variable responses to both lapatinib alone and dual therapy with lapatinib and radiation.Conclusions. The combination of lapatinib and radiation was well tolerated in this patient cohort. Overall local response rates were comparable to those reported in other studies in this patient population. Biopsies were safely performed at all time points. Inhibition of HER2 and downstream signaling pathways was identified, although no strong correlation with response was seen.",0
"Combination antiangiogenic therapy in advanced breast cancer: a phase 1 trial of vandetanib, a VEGFR inhibitor, and metronomic chemotherapy, with correlative platelet proteomics.","This phase 1 study evaluated the safety and tolerability of antiangiogenic therapy using vandetanib and metronomic cyclophosphamide and methotrexate in metastatic breast cancer. Eligible patients had metastatic breast cancer with 0-4 prior chemotherapy regimens. All received cyclophosphamide 50 mg daily, methotrexate 2.5 mg days 1-2 weekly, and vandetanib daily in 3 dose-escalation cohorts: 100 mg (C1), 200 mg (C2), and 300 mg (C3). The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability; secondary endpoints included response rate and evaluation of platelet-associated proteins. Twenty three patients were treated and evaluable for toxicity. Common mild toxicities included nausea, vomiting, LFTs abnormalities, fatigue, and rash. Three episodes of dose-limiting toxicity occurred in C3. In all cohorts, 1/3 of patients required vandetanib dose reduction, and 22 % ended therapy for toxicity. Of the 20 response-evaluable patients, 10 % demonstrated partial response and 15 % stable disease ≥24 weeks. Proteomic analyses demonstrated changes in platelet content of angiogenesis regulators, including vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet factor 4, with exposure to therapy. This regimen was tolerable at a maximum vandetanib dose of 200 mg; modest clinical activity was observed in this heavily pretreated population. Changes in the platelet proteome may serve as pharmacodynamic markers of angiogenesis inhibition. Metronomic chemotherapy is an attractive partner with biologics and deserves further study in metastatic breast cancer.",1
An European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer phase I study of lapatinib and docetaxel as neoadjuvant treatment for Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) positive locally-advanced/inflammatory or large operable breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Lapatinib is an effective anti-HER2 therapy in advanced breast cancer and docetaxel is one of the most active agents in breast cancer. Combining these agents in pre-treated patients with metastatic disease had previously proved challenging, so the primary objective of this study aimed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in treatment-naive patients, by identifying acute dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) during cycle 1 in the first part of a phases 1-2 neoadjuvant European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with large operable or locally-advanced HER2 positive breast cancer were treated with continuous lapatinib, and docetaxel every 21days for 4 cycles. Dose levels (DLs) were: 1000/75, 1250/75, 1000/85, 1250/85, 1000/100 and 1250/100 (mg/day)/(mg/m(2)). RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were included. Two DLTs occurred at dose level 5 (1000/100); one grade 4 neutropenia ⩾7days and one febrile neutropenia. A further 3 patients were therefore treated at the same dose with prophylactic granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), and 3 patients at dose level 6. No further DLTs were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our recommended dose for phase II is lapatinib 1000mg/day and docetaxel 100mg/m(2) with G-CSF in HER2 positive non-metastatic breast cancer. The dose of lapatinib should have been 1250mg/day but we were mindful of the high rate of treatment discontinuation in GeparQuinto with lapatinib 1250mg/day combined with docetaxel. No grade 3-4 diarrhoea was observed. Pharmacodynamics analysis suggests that concomitant medications altering P-glycoprotein activity (in addition to lapatinib) can modify toxicity, including non-haematological toxicities. This needs verification in larger trials, where it may contribute to understanding the sources of variability in clinical toxicity and treatment discontinuation.",1
"A Phase II Study of Trastuzumab Emtansine in Patients With Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer Who Were Previously Treated With Trastuzumab, Lapatinib, an Anthracycline, a Taxane, and Capecitabine.","PURPOSE To determine whether the antibody-drug conjugate trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), which combines human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -targeted delivery of the potent antimicrotubule agent DM1 with the antitumor activity of trastuzumab, is effective in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who have previously received all standard HER2-directed therapies. PATIENTS AND METHODS In this single-arm phase II study, T-DM1 3.6 mg/kg was administered intravenously every 3 weeks to patients with HER2-positive MBC who had prior treatment with trastuzumab, lapatinib, an anthracycline, a taxane, and capecitabine. The primary objectives were overall response rate (ORR) by independent review and safety. Results Among 110 pretreated patients (median, seven prior agents for MBC; median follow-up, 17.4 months), the ORR was 34.5% (95% CI, 26.1% to 43.9%), clinical benefit rate was 48.2% (95% CI, 38.8% to 57.9%), median progression-free survival (PFS) was 6.9 months (95% CI, 4.2 to 8.4 months), and median duration of response was 7.2 months (95% CI, 4.6 months to not estimable). In patients with confirmed HER2-positive tumors (n = 80 by retrospective central testing), the response rate was 41.3% (95% CI, 30.4% to 52.8%), and median PFS was 7.3 months (95% CI, 4.6 to 12.3 months). Most adverse events were grades 1 to 2; the most frequent grade ≥ 3 events were thrombocytopenia (9.1%), fatigue (4.5%), and cellulitis (3.6%). CONCLUSION T-DM1 is well tolerated and has single-agent activity in patients with HER2-positive MBC who have previously received both approved HER2-directed therapies and multiple chemotherapy agents. T-DM1 may be an effective new treatment for this patient population.",1
"A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 2b study evaluating sorafenib in combination with paclitaxel as a first-line therapy in patients with HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.","BACKGROUND: We conducted a phase 2b, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled screening trial to evaluate the addition of the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib (antiproliferative/antiangiogenic) to first-line paclitaxel for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally recurrent/metastatic breast cancer. METHODS: Patients were randomised to paclitaxel (90mg/m(2), weekly, intravenously, 3weeks on/1week off) plus sorafenib (400mg, orally, twice daily) or placebo. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). A sample size of 220 patients was planned with relative risk ⩽0.82 (1-sided α=0.14) after 120 events supporting a treatment effect. FINDINGS: Patients were randomised in India (n=170), the United States (n=52) and Brazil (n=15). Median PFS was 6.9months for sorafenib versus 5.6months for placebo (hazard ratio (HR)=0.788; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.558-1.112; P=0.1715 [1-sided P=0.0857]). The addition of sorafenib increased time to progression (median, 8.1 versus 5.6months; HR=0.674; 95% CI 0.465-0.975; P=0.0343) and improved overall response (67% versus 54%; P=0.0468). Overall survival did not statistically differ (median, 16.8 versus 17.4months; HR=1.022; 95% CI 0.715-1.461; P=0.904). Grade 3/4 toxicities (sorafenib versus placebo) included hand-foot skin reaction (31% versus 3%), neutropenia (13% versus 7%) and anaemia (11% versus 6%). Two treatment-related deaths occurred (malaria and liver dysfunction) in the sorafenib arm. INTERPRETATION: The addition of sorafenib to paclitaxel improved disease control but did not significantly improve PFS to support a phase 3 trial of similar design. Toxicity of the combination was manageable with dose reductions. FUNDING: Northwestern University, Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals.",1
Phase IB study of the EpCAM antibody adecatumumab combined with docetaxel in patients with EpCAM-positive relapsed or refractory advanced-stage breast cancer.,"Background Targeted therapy options in HER2-negative breast cancer are limited. This open-label, multicenter phase IB dose-escalation trial was conducted to determine safety, tolerability, and antitumor activity of a combination of docetaxel (Taxotere) and increasing doses of adecatumumab, a human IgG1 antibody targeting epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), in EpCAM-positive relapsed or primary refractory advanced-stage breast cancer. Patients and methods Patients pretreated with up to four prior chemotherapy regimens received increasing adecatumumab doses either every 3 weeks (q3w) or weekly (qw) combined with docetaxel (100 mg/m(2) q3w). Primary end points were safety and tolerability. Antitumor activity was evaluated according to RECIST. Clinical benefit was defined as complete or partial response or stable disease for ≥24 weeks. Results Thirty-one evaluable patients were treated. Most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity. Neutropenia, leukocytopenia, lymphopenia, and diarrhea (dose-limiting) were the most frequent toxic effects. Maximum tolerated doses of adecatumumab given in combination with docetaxel were 550 mg/m(2) q3w and 360 mg/m(2) qw. Clinical benefit was observed in 44% of patients treated with q3w adecatumumab and docetaxel, increasing to 63% in patients with high EpCAM-expressing tumors. Conclusion Combination therapy of adecatumumab and docetaxel is safe, feasible, and potentially active in heavily pretreated advanced-stage breast cancer.",1
"An open-label, phase 2 trial of RPI.4610 (angiozyme) in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.","BACKGROUND: Serum and plasma levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) correlate with prognosis in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). VEGF binds to 2 receptors on endothelial cells, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2. RPI.4610 (Angiozyme0) is an antiangiogenic ribozyme targeting the VEGFR-1 mRNA. Preclinical and phase 1 studies suggested that RPI.4610 is a well-tolerated agent with clinical activity in solid tumors. The authors' trial evaluated the efficacy of RPI.4610 in the treatment of patients with progressive MBC. METHODS: This phase 2, multicenter, single-arm study was designed to assess the objective response rate of RPI.4610 in patients with MBC who had experienced disease progression with at least 1 course of chemotherapy for MBC. Patients received daily subcutaneous injections of RPI.4610 100 mg/m(2) for 12 weeks. RESULTS: Most patients (93%) had received at least 2 lines of chemotherapy previously; 69% of patients had received at least 3 lines of chemotherapy. Median follow-up was 2.76 months (range, 0.89-36.6 months). No partial responses nor complete responses were found. Median progression-free survival was 1.41 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.35-1.45). The median overall survival from start of treatment was 11.89 months (95% CI, 4.11-23.66). Treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were primarily grade 1 to 2 in intensity. Most common AEs were: injection site reactions, abdominal pain, anorexia, chromaturia, constipation, dyspnea, fatigue, headache, pain at the injection site, nausea, vomiting, and fever. CONCLUSIONS: Although RPI.4610 demonstrated a well-tolerated safety profile, its lack of clinical efficacy precludes this drug from further development.

Randomized phase II study of three doses of oral TAS-108 in postmenopausal patients with metastatic breast cancer.,"This randomized phase II study was intended to identify the optimal dose of TAS-108, a novel steroidal antiestrogen, for the treatment of breast cancer in postmenopausal Japanese women. The potential clinical effects of TAS-108 on the uterus, bone, serum lipids, and hormones were also investigated. Postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer who had previously received one or two endocrine therapies were randomly assigned to one of the three possible dose levels of TAS-108 (40, 80 or 120 mg/day). Oral TAS-108 was given daily, and the efficacy and safety of the three doses were evaluated. A total of 97 patients (33, 32, and 32 in the 40-, 80-, and 120-mg groups, respectively) were treated with TAS-108. The clinical benefit rate was 30.3% for the 40-mg, 25.0% for the 80-mg, and 25.0% for the 120-mg group. The 40-mg group achieved the prespecified target threshold. TAS-108 at all dose levels was well tolerated and appeared to have no harmful effects in terms of the variables examined in this study. We conclude that the optimal dose of TAS-108 among the three doses is 40 mg, once daily, for further studies. JAPIC Clinical Trials Information number: Japic CTI - 121754.",1
Bone-Related Complications and Quality of Life in Advanced Breast Cancer: Results from a Randomized Phase III Trial of Denosumab versus Zoledronic Acid.,"PURPOSE: Denosumab was shown to be superior to zoledronic acid in preventing skeletal related events (SRE) in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases in a randomized, double-blind phase III study. We evaluated further results from this study related to skeletal complications and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive subcutaneous denosumab 120 mg (n = 1,026) and intravenous placebo, or intravenous zoledronic acid 4 mg (n = 1,020) and subcutaneous placebo every 4 weeks. Analyses reported here include the proportion of patients with one or multiple on-study SREs, time to first radiation to bone, time to first SRE or hypercalcemia of malignancy, and change in HRQoL (functional assessment of cancer therapy-general). RESULTS: Fewer patients receiving denosumab than zoledronic acid had an on-study SRE (31% vs. 36%, P = 0.006). The incidence of first radiation to bone was 12% (n = 123) with denosumab versus 16% (n = 162) with zoledronic acid. Denosumab prolonged the time to first radiation to bone by 26% versus zoledronic acid (HR, 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59-0.94, P = 0.012) and prolonged the time to first SRE or hypercalcemia of malignancy by 18% (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70-0.95; P = 0.007). Ten percent more patients had a clinically meaningful improvement in HRQoL with denosumab relative to zoledronic acid, regardless of baseline pain levels. CONCLUSIONS: Denosumab was superior to zoledronic acid in reducing bone-related complications of metastatic breast cancer and maintained HRQoL, providing an efficacious, well-tolerated treatment option for patients with bone metastases from breast cancer.

Comparison between doublet agents versus single agent in metastatic breast cancer patients previously treated with an anthracycline and a taxane: A meta-analysis of four phase III trials.,"AIM: To compare doublet agents with single agent as salvage treatment in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients pre-treated with an anthracycline and a taxane. METHODS: We systematically searched for randomised clinical trials that compared doublet agents with single agent in MBC patients pre-treated with an anthracycline and a taxane. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Secondary end points were progression-free survival, overall response rate and grade 3 or 4 toxicity. Data were extracted from the studies by two independent reviewers. The meta-analysis was performed by Stata version 10.0 software (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). RESULTS: Four trials comprising 2373 patients were eligible for inclusion. Meta-analysis showed that there was significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) (hazard ratio (HR) 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72-0.86, P = 0.000) and overall response rate (risk ratio (RR) 1.47, 95%CI 1.13-1.91; p = 0.004) in doublet agents group, though the pooled HR for OS (HR 0.96, 95%CI 0.87-1.05; p = 0.356) showed no significant difference. Subgroup analysis also favoured capecitabine-based doublet agents therapy in terms of PFS (HR 0.77, 95%CI 0.70-0.86; p = 0.000) and overall response rate (ORR) (RR 1.65, 95%CI 1.06-2.56; p = 0.026), but gemcitabine-based doublet agents therapy gained no clinical benefits. There were more incidences of grade 3 or 4 anaemia (RR 1.610, 1.212-2.314, p = 0.01), neutropenia (RR 2.239, 1.231-4.071, p = 0.008), thrombocytopaenia (RR 2.401, 1.595-3.615, p = 0.000), fatigue (RR 2.333, 1.338-4.006, p = 0.000) and nausea and vomiting (RR 2.233, 1.558-3.199, p = 0.000) in the combination group. With regard to the risk of grade 3 or 4 stomatitis (RR 1.666, 0.818-3.392, p = 0.160), diarrhoea (RR 0.739, 0.542-1.008, p = 0.056) and hand-foot syndrome (RR 1.002, 0.835-1.203, p = 0.983), equivalent frequencies were found between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Combination chemotherapy offered a significant improvement in PFS and ORR in patients with MBC pre-treated with an anthracycline and a taxane but did not benefit OS. With present available data from randomised clinical trials, we were still unable to clearly set the role of combination therapy in the treatment of MBC in this setting.",0
"Efficacy and Safety of Docetaxel Combined With Oxaliplatin as a Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Regimen for Chinese Triple-Negative Local Advanced Breast Cancer Patients: A Prospective, Open, and Unicentric Phase II Clinical Trial.","BACKGROUND AND AIMS:: To determine the efficacy and toxicity of an oxaliplatin-based regimen as a neoadjuvant chemotherapy setting in triple-negative local advanced breast cancer (TNLABC) patients. METHODS:: Patients with stage IIIb or IIIc, chemotherapy-naive TNLABC receive docetaxel 75 mg/m day 1 and oxaliplatin 130 mg/m day 2, every 21 days for up to 4 cycles. The primary end point is pathologic complete response (CR), and the secondary end points are clinical response (including CR and partial response), disease-free survival, overall survival, and safety. RESULTS:: Twenty-nine TNLABC patients were treated: 17(58.62%) had stage IIIB disease and 12 (41.38%) had stage IIIC disease. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, there were 10 patients (34.48%) with pathologic CR (95% confidence interval, 21.51%-48.70%). Twenty patients responded (7 CR and 13 partial response) with a 68.97% total clinical response rate (95% confidence interval 57.51%-88.02%). Nearly 27.59% patients (8 patients) had disease progression after at least 2 cycles of chemotherapy, and only 1 patient (3.45%) had the disease stable, respectively. In the 29 treated patients, there were no unusual or unexpected adverse events in a total of 91 cycles for the chemotherapy setting. Common grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicities were leukocytopenia, which occured in 4 TNLABC patients (13.79%), and thrombocytopenia in 1 patient (3.45%). Grade 3 or 4 transaminase elevation occured in 5 (17.24%) patients and grade 3 vomiting occured in 1(3.45%) patient. One patient experienced grade 3 neurosensory toxicities. There are 5 reports (17.24%) of grade 3 fatigue. CONCLUSIONS:: The results of this phase II clinical study suggest that docetaxel combined with oxaliplatin as a neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen in TNLABC patients is active and well tolerated, and should be further investigated as a favorable treatment alternative for TNLABC patients. A large randomized prospective clinical study is warranted to confirm the results.",1
The mTOR inhibitor everolimus in combination with carboplatin in metastatic breast cancer - a phase I trial.,"AIM: Despite advances in the the first- and second-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer, there remains a large unmet need for additional treatment options. As preclinical studies have suggested that combining everolimus with carboplatin may produce higher activity than each drug by itself, we initiated a phase I study of this combination. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with pre-treated metastatic breast cancer received weekly carboplatin at AUC2 and daily oral everolimus at different dose-levels (level I: 2.5 mg; II: 5 mg; III: 7.5 mg; IV: 10 mg). Three patients were assigned to dose-levels I to III, and six to dose-level IV. The primary end-point was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). RESULTS: Fifteen patients were recruited to the study. The median number of previous chemotherapies was four (range: 1-11). No dose-limiting toxicity occurred at levels I-III during the first cycle. Based on the pre-determined definition, the maximum planned dose-level IV was selected as the MTD. Patients received a median of four cycles of treatment (range 1-13). Most frequent grade 3 and 4 toxicities included leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and infection. Response rates were as follows: 21% partial response, 43% stable disease, and 36% progressive disease. CONCLUSION: Carboplatin and everolimus is a well-tolerated combination for heavily pre-treated metastatic breast cancer. Everolimus (10 mg/d) and carboplatin (AUC2 weekly) were defined as the MTD. This dose is currently being employed in an ongoing phase II trial.",1
Phase 1b dose-finding study of motesanib with docetaxel or paclitaxel in patients with metastatic breast cancer.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of motesanib when combined with docetaxel or paclitaxel in patients with metastatic breast cancer. In this open-label, dose-finding, phase 1b study, patients received motesanib 50 or 125-mg orally once daily (QD), beginning day 3 of cycle 1 of chemotherapy, continuously in combination with either paclitaxel 90 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28-day cycle (Arm A) or docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) on day 1 every 21-day cycle (Arm B). Dose escalation to motesanib 125 mg QD occurred if the incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs, primary endpoint) was ≤33 %. If the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of motesanib was established in Arm B, additional patients could receive motesanib at the MTD plus docetaxel 75 mg/m(2). Forty-six patients were enrolled and 45 received ≥1 dose of motesanib. The incidence of DLTs was <33 % in all cohorts; thus, motesanib 125 mg QD was established as the MTD. Seven patients (16 %) had grade 3 motesanib-related adverse events including cholecystitis (2 patients) and hypertension (2 patients). Pharmacokinetic parameters of motesanib were similar to those reported in previous studies. The objective response rate was 56 % among patients with measurable disease at baseline who received motesanib in combination with taxane-based chemotherapy. The addition of motesanib to either paclitaxel or docetaxel was generally tolerable up to the 125-mg QD dose of motesanib. The objective response rate of 56 % suggests a potential benefit of motesanib in combination with taxane-based chemotherapy.",1
A phase II trial to assess efficacy and safety of afatinib in extensively pretreated patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer.,"Afatinib (BIBW 2992) is an ErbB-family blocker that irreversibly inhibits signaling from all relevant ErbB-family dimers. Afatinib has demonstrated preclinical activity in human epidermal growth factor receptor HER2 (ErbB2)-positive and triple-negative xenograft models of breast cancer, and clinical activity in phase I studies. This was a multicenter phase II study enrolling patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer progressing following no more than three lines of chemotherapy. No prior epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted therapy was allowed. Patients received 50-mg afatinib once daily until disease progression. Tumor assessment was performed at every other 28-day treatment course. The primary endpoint was clinical benefit (CB) for ≥4 treatment courses in triple-negative (Cohort A) metastatic breast cancer (TNBC) and objective responses measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors in patients with HER2-negative, estrogen receptor-positive, and/or progesterone receptor-positive breast cancer (Cohort B). Fifty patients received treatment, including 29 patients in Cohort A and 21 patients in Cohort B. No objective responses were observed in either cohort. Median progression-free survival was 7.4 and 7.7 weeks in Cohorts A and B, respectively. Three patients with TNBC had stable disease for ≥4 treatment courses, one of them for 12 courses (median 26.3 weeks; range 18.9-47.9 weeks). The most frequently observed afatinib-associated adverse events (AEs) were gastrointestinal and skin-related side effects, which were manageable by symptomatic treatment and dose reductions. Afatinib pharmacokinetics were comparable to those observed in previously reported phase I trials. In conclusion, afatinib had limited activity in HER2-negative breast cancer. AEs were generally manageable and mainly affected the skin and the gastrointestinal tract.",1
Metronomic oral combination chemotherapy with capecitabine and cyclophosphamide: a phase II study in patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: Metronomic combination chemotherapy with the oral fluoropyrimidine doxifluridine/5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (5 -DFUR) and oral cyclophosphamide (C) showed promising efficacy in a single-arm study. The oral fluoropyrimidine capecitabine was designed to deliver 5-fluorouracil preferentially to tumors, potentially improving efficacy over doxifluridine. We conducted a phase II multicenter study to evaluate an all-oral XC combination in patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients received capecitabine 828 mg/m(2) twice daily with cyclophosphamide 33 mg/m(2) twice daily, days 1-14 every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. RESULTS: Between May 2007 and April 2009, 51 patients were enrolled and 45 were included in the efficacy analysis. The median follow-up was 18.1 months. ORR was 44.4% and stable disease (≥24 weeks) was achieved in 13.4%, resulting in a 57.8% clinical benefit response rate. Median PFS was 12.3 months (95% confidence interval: 8.9-18.9 months). Median PFS was 10.7 months in triple-negative disease and 13.2 months in estrogen-receptor positive, HER2-negative disease. The 1- and 2-year OS rates were 86 and 71%, respectively. Median OS has not been reached. Grade 3 adverse events comprised leukopenia (26%), neutropenia (16%), and decreased hemoglobin (2%). There was no grade 3 hand-foot syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Oral XC is an effective first- or second-line therapy for MBC, demonstrating high activity in both luminal A and triple-negative disease with few severe side effects. This metronomic oral combination chemotherapy could be beneficial for the treatment of HER2-negative MBC.",1
Assessment of quality of life in advanced breast cancer. An overview of randomized phase III trials.,"BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) parameters are often used as end points in phase III trials in advanced breast cancer. The frequency and correlates of significant gains in HRQOL have not been assessed. METHODS: To evaluate the contemporary role for HRQOL assessment in advanced breast cancer, we searched PubMed for the main and companion papers reporting the results of phase III trials on systemic antineoplastic therapies published between 1/98 and 7/09 in 11 leading journals. RESULTS: The search yielded 87 trials that enrolled a total of 33,669 patients. HRQOL was mentioned/reported in the main paper in 34 trials, reported in a companion paper in one (a total of 35/87=40%), and mentioned in the abstract of the main paper in 19/34 cases (56%). There was no temporal trend for reporting on HRQOL in the two 6-year periods. Although formal statistical comparisons were reported in 31/35 cases (89%), a significant difference was found in only 4/31 (13%) trials, always favoring the experimental arm. Given the small number of studies with a significant HRQOL finding, we could not assess correlates of gain in HRQOL. CONCLUSIONS: HRQOL is one of the key indicators of treatment benefit in advanced breast cancer, but contemporary systemic therapies in this setting do not appear to affect HRQOL differentially.",0
Maintenance of Clinical Efficacy After Dose Reduction of Ixabepilone Plus Capecitabine in Patients With Anthracycline- and Taxane-Resistant Metastatic Breast Cancer: A Retrospective Analysis of Pooled Data From 2 Phase III Randomized Clinical Trials.,"BACKGROUND: This retrospective analysis aimed to determine whether early dose reduction impacts the efficacy of ixabepilone plus capecitabine in women with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 2 phase III trials, patients (N = 1973) with anthracycline/taxane-pretreated MBC were randomized to receive ixabepilone 40 mg/m(2) on day 1 plus capecitabine 1000 mg/m(2) twice daily (BID) on days 1 to 14 or single-agent capecitabine 1250 mg/m(2) BID on days 1 to 14 of a 3-week course. Because of the similar design and populations, data from trials were pooled to evaluate efficacy of the combination regimen among women who did or did not undergo ixabepilone dose reduction during the first 4 courses. To adjust for bias resulting from selecting patients with inherently better outcome based on longer treatment durations, these analyses were restricted to patients who received ≥ 4 courses of ixabepilone. RESULTS: The pooled cohort included 566 patients with measurable disease who were evaluable for efficacy. Patients who had early dose reduction showed similar objective response rates (ORRs) and progression-free survival (PFS) as did those with no/late dose reduction. ORRs were 62.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 55.8%-69.0%) and 55.3% (95% CI, 49.9%-60.6%), respectively; median PFS was 7.2 months (95% CI, 6.6-8.0) and 7.0 months (95% CI, 6.5-7.5), respectively (hazard ratio = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.83-1.17). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that early ixabepilone dose reduction did not affect the overall efficacy of ixabepilone plus capecitabine in patients with MBC who received ≥ 4 courses of treatment. By making appropriate dose reductions, ixabepilone-related toxicities can be minimized while maintaining clinical efficacy.",0
"Randomized phase II trial of everolimus in combination with tamoxifen in patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer with prior exposure to aromatase inhibitors: a GINECO study.","PURPOSE: Cross-talk between signal transduction pathways likely contributes to hormone resistance in metastatic breast cancer (mBC). Everolimus, an oral inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin, has restored sensitivity in endocrine-resistance models and shown anticancer activity in early-phase mBC clinical trials. This analysis evaluated efficacy and safety of everolimus in combination with tamoxifen in patients with mBC resistant to aromatase inhibitors (AIs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This open-label, phase II study randomly assigned postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, AI-resistant mBC to tamoxifen 20 mg/d plus everolimus 10 mg/d (n = 54) or tamoxifen 20 mg/d alone (n = 57). Randomization was stratified by primary and secondary hormone resistance. Primary end point was clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as the percentage of all patients with a complete or partial response or stable disease at 6 months. No formal statistical comparison between groups was planned. RESULTS: The 6-month CBR was 61% (95% CI, 47 to 74) with tamoxifen plus everolimus and 42% (95% CI, 29 to 56) with tamoxifen alone. Time to progression (TTP) increased from 4.5 months with tamoxifen alone to 8.6 months with tamoxifen plus everolimus, corresponding to a 46% reduction in risk of progression with the combination (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.81). Risk of death was reduced by 55% with tamoxifen plus everolimus versus tamoxifen alone (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.81). The main toxicities associated with tamoxifen plus everolimus were fatigue (72% v 53% with tamoxifen alone), stomatitis (56% v 7%), rash (44% v 7%), anorexia (43% v 18%), and diarrhea (39% v 11%). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that tamoxifen plus everolimus increased CBR, TTP, and overall survival compared with tamoxifen alone in postmenopausal women with AI-resistant mBC.",1
"A multicenter, phase II study of epirubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel and concurrent trastuzumab as primary systemic therapy for HER-2 positive advanced breast cancer (the HER2NAT study).","BACKGROUND: The outcome in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2)-positive locally advanced breast cancer may be improved by integrating trastuzumab with primary systemic therapy (PST). METHODS: The efficacy and safety of PST comprising EC (epirubicin 90 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2), four cycles every 3 weeks) followed by docetaxel (75 mg/m(2), four cycles every 3 weeks) and concurrent trastuzumab (loading dose 4 mg/kg followed by 2 mg/kg, 12 cycles every week) was investigated in a multicenter, prospective, phase II study in patients with HER-2-positive stage IIIB/IIIC/IV breast cancer. The primary endpoint was pathologic complete response (pCR) including the tumor intraductal component confirmed by central pathologic review. RESULTS: In total, 38 patients were enrolled (stage IIIB, 63.2 %; IIIC, 23.7 %; IV, 13.2 %; estrogen receptor- and/or progesterone receptor-positive, 47.4 %). The pCR rate was 16.2 % in the primary tumor (six of 37 patients in the Full Analysis Set) and 56.8 % (21/37) in the ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes. Treatment was given according to protocol in 28 of 37 patients; six of 28 in the Per-Protocol Set achieved pCR (21.4 %). The clinical response rate was 67.6 % (25/37 patients; complete response, 13.5 %; partial response, 54.1 %). No patients developed congestive heart failure; however, three patients had a non-symptomatic decrease of >10 % of left ventricular ejection fraction. CONCLUSIONS: PST including concurrent use of trastuzumab combined with docetaxel is effective and well-tolerated in HER-2-positive advanced breast cancer patients, including those patients requiring mastectomy for local control.",1
"Results of a phase II open-label, non-randomized trial of cisplatin chemotherapy in patients with BRCA1-positive metastatic breast cancer.","ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the efficacy of cisplatin chemotherapy in BRCA1 mutation carriers with metastatic breast cancer. METHODS: In a phase II, open-label study, 20 patients with metastatic breast cancer who carried a mutation in BRCA1 were treated with cisplatin 75 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks as part of a 21-day cycle for 6 cycles. Restaging studies to assess response were performed after cycles 2 and 6, and every three months thereafter. RESULTS: Between July 2007 and January 2009, 20 patients were enrolled. Baseline characteristics were as follows: 65% had prior adjuvant chemotherapy, 55% had prior chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer; mean age was 48 years (ranges 32 to 70); 30% estrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor (PR)+, 70% ER/PR/Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)- and 0% HER2+. Overall response rate was 80%; nine patients experienced a complete clinical response (45%) and seven experienced a partial response (35%). Overall survival was 80% at one year, 60% at two years and 25% at three years. Four of the 20 patients are alive four years after initiating treatment. The median time to progression was 12 months. The median survival from the start of cisplatinum treatment was 30 months. Cisplatin-related adverse events, including nausea (50%), anemia (5%) and neutropenia (35%) were mostly mild to moderate in severity. CONCLUSIONS: This phase II study demonstrates that cisplatin chemotherapy has high activity in women with a BRCA1 mutation and metastatic breast cancer and is generally well tolerated. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered retrospectively on the clinical trials website ClinicalTrials.gov. The identifier is NCT01611727.",1
A phase II trial of capecitabine in combination with the farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib in patients with anthracycline-treated and taxane-resistant metastatic breast cancer: an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Study (E1103).,"Capecitabine produces an objective response rate of up to 25% in anthracycline-treated, taxane-resistant metastatic breast cancer (MBC). The farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib inhibits Ras signaling and has clinical activity when used alone in MBC. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of tipifarnib-capecitabine combination in MBC patients who were previously treated with an anthracycline and progressed on taxane therapy. Eligible patients received oral capecitabine 1,000 mg/m2 twice daily plus oral tipifarnib 300 mg twice daily on days 1-14 every 21 days. The primary endpoint was ORR. The trial was powered to detect an improvement in response rate from 25 to 40%. Among 63 eligible, partial response occurred in six patients (9.5%; 90% CI 4.2-17.9%), median progression-free survival was 2.6 months (95% CI 2.1-4.4), and median overall survival was 11.4 months (95% CI 7.7-14.0). Dose modifications were required for 43 patients (68%) for either tipifarnib and/or capecitabine. Grades 3 and 4 toxicities were seen in 30 patients (44%; 90% CI 44.4-67.0%) and 11 patients (16%; 90% CI 10.8-29.0%), respectively. The most common grade 3 toxicities included neutropenia, nausea, and vomiting; and the most common grade 4 toxicity was neutropenia (8 out of 11 cases). The tipifarnib-capecitabine combination is not more effective than capecitabine alone in MBC patients who were previously treated with an anthracycline and taxane therapy.",1
Final results of a multicenter phase II clinical trial evaluating the activity of single-agent lapatinib in patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer and HER2-positive circulating tumor cells. A proof-of-concept study.,"This multicenter phase II trial was designed to evaluate the activity of lapatinib in metastatic breast cancer patients with HER2-negative primary tumors and HER2-positive circulating tumor cells (CTCs). In this study MBC patients with HER2-negative primary tumors and HER2-positive CTCs previously treated with at least a first-line therapy for metastatic disease received lapatinib 1500 mg/day. The CellSearch System® was used for CTCs isolation and bio-characterization. HER2 status was assessed on CTCs by immunofluorescence. A case was defined as CTCs positive if ≥2 CTC/7.5 ml of blood were isolated and HER2-positive if ≥50% of CTCs were HER2-positive. 139 HER2-negative patients were screened, 96 patients were positive for CTCs (mean number of CTCs: 85; median number of CTCs: 19; range 2-1637). Seven of the 96 patients (7%) had ≥50% HER2-positive CTCs and were eligible for treatment with lapatinib. No objective tumor responses occurred in this population. In one patient, disease stabilization lasting 254 days (8.5 months) was observed. From the findings of this study, we concluded that a subset of patients with a HER2-negative primary tumor presents HER2-positive CTCs during disease progression, although the HER2 shift rate seems to be lower than previously reported. Despite the lack of objective response, the durable disease stabilization observed in one patient cannot rule out the hypothesis that lapatinib may have some activity in this patient population. However, considering that only 1/139 screened patients may potentially have derived benefit from this approach, future trials designed according to the presented strategy cannot be recommended.",1
A phase II study of lapatinib and bevacizumab as treatment for HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer.,"Preclinical data have demonstrated that the combination of antihuman epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (anti-HER2) and antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF)--targeted agents has antitumor activity; these data indicate certain patients with HER2-overexpressing breast cancer may derive clinical benefit from this combination. The purpose of this single-arm phase II study was to determine the efficacy and safety of the dual-targeting combination of lapatinib and bevacizumab. Women with HER2-overexpressing advanced breast cancer received 1,500 mg oral lapatinib daily plus 10 mg/kg IV bevacizumab every 2 weeks. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) at week 12; secondary endpoints included overall tumor response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), duration of response, time-to-response, PFS, and safety. Circulating tumor cells (CTC) and circulating endothelial cells (CEC) were measured at baseline and during study treatment as potential response markers. Fifty-two patients with stage IV disease were enrolled. The 12-week investigator-assessed PFS rate was 69.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 54.9, 81.3). Median PFS was 24.7 weeks (95% CI: 20.4, 35.1), and the CBR was 30.8% (95% CI: 18.7, 45.1). Of 45 patients with measurable disease, 6 were determined to have a partial response per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (ORR: 13.3%; 95% CI: 5.1, 26.8). The most common adverse events (AEs) included diarrhea, rash, and fatigue; most of these were either grade 1 or 2. Clinical responses were correlated with decreases in CTC and CEC. Lapatinib plus bevacizumab was active in patients with HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. The AE profile of the combination was consistent with the known profiles for these agents.",1
Randomized double-blind phase 2 trial of 3 doses of TAS-108 in patients with advanced or metastatic postmenopausal breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate 3 different doses of (7α)-21-(4-[(diethylamino)methyl]-2 methoxyphenoxy)-7 methyl-19 norpregna-1,3,5(10)-trien-3-ol 2-hydroxy-1,2,3-propanetricarboxylate (TAS-108) in patients with recurrent, hormone-responsive breast cancer. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, multicenter study, TAS-108 was administered daily at a dose of 40 mg, 80 mg, or 120 mg to postmenopausal patients with locally advanced, or inoperable, or metastatic hormone-receptor positive breast cancer. The primary efficacy outcome was clinical benefit (CB), defined as the total number of patients who achieved a complete response, a partial response, or stable disease for ≥24 weeks. The study was a 2-stage design in which 19 patients per dose group were planned in the first stage. If at least 3 patients in any dose group achieved a CB, then that dose group was to be allowed to continue enrolling for the second stage, and the group could include up to a total of 60 patients. RESULTS: The 40-mg and 80-mg groups met the criterion and enrolled patients into the second stage. In the 40-mg group, there were 13 CB events in 60 patients (21.7%); and, in the 80-mg group, there were 12 CB events in 60 patients (20%). The 120-mg daily dose was stopped early, because it failed to achieve the criterion. For the 40-mg and 80-mg groups, the median time to progression was 15.0 weeks and 15.9 weeks, respectively. Only 1 drug-related serious adverse event (grade 3 hyperglycemia) was reported. CONCLUSIONS: TAS-108 at 40 mg and 80 mg daily demonstrated clinical activity with an encouraging duration of benefit. Because of its superior safety profile, TAS-108 40 mg daily is recommended for further development.",1
Phase I/II trial of non-cytotoxic suramin in combination with weekly paclitaxel in metastatic breast cancer treated with prior taxanes.,"PURPOSE: Suramin, a polysulfonated naphthylurea, inhibits the actions of polypeptide growth factors including acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors (aFGF and bFGF), which confer broad spectrum chemotherapy resistance. We hypothesized that suramin at non-cytotoxic doses in combination with weekly paclitaxel would be well tolerated and demonstrate anti-tumor activity. METHODS: Women with metastatic breast cancer who had been previously treated with a taxane in the adjuvant or metastatic setting were eligible. The primary objective of the phase I was to determine the dose of intravenous (IV) weekly suramin that resulted in plasma concentrations between 10 and 50 umol/l over 8-48 h (or the target range) in combination with IV 80 mg/m(2) of weekly paclitaxel. The primary objective of the phase II trial was to determine the anti-tumor activity of the dosing regimen defined in phase I. Therapy was continued until disease progression or development of unacceptable toxicity. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were enrolled (9: phase I; 22: phase II). In phase I, no dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Pharmacokinetics during the first cycle showed suramin concentrations within the target range for 21 of 24 weekly treatments (88 %). In phase II, the objective response rate (ORR) was 23 % (95 % CI 8-45 %), the median progression-free survival was 3.4 months (95 % CI 2.1-4.9 months), and the median overall survival was 11.2 months (95 % CI 6.6-16.0 months). CONCLUSIONS: Non-cytotoxic doses of suramin in combination with weekly paclitaxel were well tolerated. The efficacy was below the pre-specified criteria required to justify further investigation.",1
A multicenter phase II trial of docetaxel and capecitabine as salvage treatment in anthracycline- and taxane-pretreated patients with metastatic breast cancer.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of docetaxel plus capecitabine (DC) combination as salvage treatment in anthracycline- and taxane-pretreated patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). PATIENTS AND TREATMENT: Patients with MBC who had disease progression after initial chemotherapy with anthracyclines (n = 29; 100 %) and taxanes (n = 11; 37.9 %) were treated with oral capecitabine 950 mg/m(2) twice daily on days 1-14 and docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) on day 1 every 3 weeks. Nineteen (65.5 %) patients received this regimen as second line and 10 (34.5 %) as ≥3rd line of therapy. All patients were evaluable for response and toxicity. RESULTS: Complete response occurred in two (6.9 %) patients and partial response in eleven (37.9 %) for an overall response rate of 44.8 % (95 % CI 26.7-62.9 %). Eleven women (37.9 %) had stable disease and five (17.2 %) progressive disease. Of the eleven patients previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes, five (45.5 %) responded to DC combination. The median duration of response was 5.7 months (range 3.4-64.2), the median time to disease progression 9.3 months (range 1.2-58), and the median overall survival 25.5 months. No toxic death occurred. Neutropenia grade 4 occurred in 58.6 % of patients and three of them (10.3 %) developed neutropenic fever. Non-hematological toxicities were manageable with grade 3 hand-foot syndrome occurring in 6.9 % of the patients, fatigue in 3.4 %, and neurotoxicity in 3.4 %. CONCLUSION: The DC combination is a valuable regimen as salvage treatment in anthracycline- or anthracycline and taxane-pretreated patients with MBC.",1
Phase II Trial of Nab-Paclitaxel Compared With Docetaxel as First-Line Chemotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer: Final Analysis of Overall Survival.,"BACKGROUND: A randomized phase II study in first-line MBC demonstrated superior efficacy and safety of weekly nab-paclitaxel compared with docetaxel. Final survival analyses and updated safety results are reported. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred two patients with no previous chemotherapy for MBC were randomized to receive nab-paclitaxel 300 mg/m(2) q3w, nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m(2) or 150 mg/m(2) the first 3 of 4 weeks (qw 3/4), or docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) q3w. The trial was powered for analyses of antitumor activity and safety. RESULTS: Treatment with nab-paclitaxel 150 mg/m(2) qw 3/4 resulted in a median overall survival (OS) of 33.8 months compared with 22.2, 27.7, and 26.6 months for nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m(2) qw 3/4, nab-paclitaxel 300 mg/m(2) q3w, and docetaxel, respectively (overall P = .047). Patients receiving 150 mg/m(2)nab-paclitaxel had prolonged median OS compared with those in the 100 mg/m(2)nab-paclitaxel arm (hazard ratio, 0.575; P = .008). A trend toward a longer OS was noted in the 150 mg/m(2)nab-paclitaxel arm versus docetaxel arm (hazard ratio, 0.688). Grade 3 or 4 fatigue, neutropenia, and febrile neutropenia were less frequent in all nab-paclitaxel arms compared with docetaxel. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with previously published efficacy results, these data suggest that 150 mg/m(2) qw 3/4 may represent the most clinically efficacious nab-paclitaxel dosing regimen for patients with no previous chemotherapy for MBC. A phase III trial confirming these results would be necessary and prudent before widespread adoption of the 150 mg/m(2) dose in clinical practice.",1
A phase II study of eribulin in Japanese patients with heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Eribulin mesylate is a non-taxane microtubule dynamics inhibitor that recently gained Food and Drug Administration approval for late-line metastatic breast cancer (MBC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this single-arm, multicentre open-label phase II trial Japanese patients pretreated with an anthracycline and a taxane received 1.4 mg/m(2) eribulin mesylate (2- to 5-min i.v. infusion on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle). The primary efficacy end point was overall response rate (ORR) by independent review. RESULTS: Patients (N = 80) had received a median of three prior chemotherapy regimens (range 1-5). ORR was 21.3% [95% confidence interval (CI) 12.9-31.8; all partial responses (PRs)], stable disease (SD) occurred in 30 patients (37.5%) and the clinical benefit rate (complete response + PR + SD ≥6 months) was 27.5% (95% CI 18.1-38.6). Median duration of response was 3.9 months (95% CI 2.8-4.9), progression-free survival was 3.7 months (95% CI 2.0-4.4) and overall survival was 11.1 months (95% CI 7.9-15.8). The most frequent treatment-related grade 3/4 adverse events were neutropenia (95.1%), leukopenia (74.1%) and febrile neutropenia (13.6%). Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy occurred in 3.7% of patients (no grade 4). CONCLUSIONS: Eribulin exhibited efficacy and tolerability in Japanese patients with heavily pretreated MBC.",1
"A phase II study of afatinib (BIBW 2992), an irreversible ErbB family blocker, in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer progressing after trastuzumab.","Afatinib is an oral, ErbB family blocker, which covalently binds and irreversibly blocks all kinase-competent ErbB family members. This phase II, open-label, single-arm study explored afatinib activity in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer patients progressing after trastuzumab treatment. Patients had stage IIIB/IV HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, with progression following trastuzumab or trastuzumab intolerance and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2. Patients received 50 mg afatinib once-daily until disease progression. Primary endpoint was objective response rate (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.0), with tumor assessments every 8 weeks. Forty-one patients were treated. Patients had received a median of three prior chemotherapy lines (range, 0-15) and 68.3% had received trastuzumab for >1 year. Four patients (10% of 41 treated; 11% of evaluable patients) had partial response. Fifteen patients (37% of 41) had stable disease as best response and 19 (46% of 41) achieved clinical benefit. Median progression-free survival was 15.1 weeks (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.1-16.7); median overall survival was 61.0 weeks (95% CI: 56.7-not evaluable). Most frequent common terminology criteria for adverse events grade 3 treatment-related adverse events were diarrhea (24.4%) and rash (9.8%). Afatinib monotherapy was associated with promising clinical activity in extensively pretreated HER2-positive breast cancer patients who had progressed following trastuzumab treatment.",1
A randomized trial of combination anastrozole plus gefitinib and of combination fulvestrant plus gefitinib in the treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer.,"EGFR signalling pathways appear involved in endocrine therapy resistance in breast cancer. This trial estimates the antitumor efficacy and toxicity of the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib in combination with anastrozole or fulvestrant in postmenopausal hormone receptor positive breast cancer. Subjects with estrogen receptor and/or PgR positive, metastatic breast cancer were randomized into this phase II study of gefitinib (initial dose was 500 mg orally daily, due to high rate of diarrhea, starting dose was reduced to 250 mg orally daily) with either anastrozole 1 mg daily or fulvestrant 250 mg every 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was clinical benefit (complete responses plus partial responses plus stable disease for 6 months or longer). 141 eligible subjects were enrolled, 72 in the anastrozole plus gefitinib arm, and 69 in the fulvestrant plus gefitinib arm. Anastrozole plus gefitinib had a clinical benefit rate of 44% [95% confidence interval (CI) 33-57%] and fulvestrant plus gefitinib 41% (95% CI 29-53%). Median progression-free survival was 5.3 months (95% CI 3.1-10.4) versus 5.2 months (95% CI 2.9-8.2) for anastrozole plus gefitinib versus fulvestrant plus gefitinib, respectively. Median survival was 30.3 months (95% CI 21.2-38.9+) versus 23.9 months (95% CI 15.4-33.5) for anastrozole plus gefitinib versus fulvestrant plus gefitinib, respectively. In general, the toxicity is greater than expected for single agent endocrine therapy alone. Anastrozole plus gefitinib and fulvestrant plus gefitinib have similar clinical benefit rates in the treatment of estrogen and/or PgR positive metastatic breast cancer, and the rates of response are not clearly superior to gefitinib or endocrine therapy alone. Further studies of EGFR inhibition plus endocrine therapy do not appear warranted, but if performed should include attempts to identify biomarkers predictive of antitumor activity.",1
A phase I study of ixabepilone in combination with epirubicin in patients with metastatic breast cancer.,"In this phase I trial, 42 women with metastatic breast cancer were treated with a fixed dose of epirubicin (75 mg/m2) and escalating doses of ixabepilone (25, 30, and 35 mg/m2). The maximum-tolerated dose of ixabepilone in combination with epirubicin was 30 mg/m2 (the recommended dose for phase II evaluation), and the dose-limiting toxicity dose was 35 mg/m2 with grade 4 neutropenia.PURPOSE: The objectives of this phase I trial were to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), toxicity profile, dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), pharmacokinetics, and the recommended phase II dose for ixabepilone in combination with epirubicin in women with metastatic breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients ≥18 years old with an histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of invasive breast cancer and clinical evidence of locally recurrent or metastatic disease were enrolled and treated with a fixed dose of epirubicin (75 mg/m(2)) and escalating doses of ixabepilone (25, 30, and 35 mg/m(2)). RESULTS: Forty-two women were treated at 3 different dose levels of ixabepilone: 25 (n = 6), 30 (n = 30), and 35 mg/m(2) (n = 6) in combination with 75 mg/m(2) epirubicin. The MTD of ixabepilone in combination with epirubicin 75 mg/m(2) was 30 mg/m(2), and the DLT dose was 35 mg/m(2) with grade 4 neutropenia. Grade 3/4 neutropenia was the most frequent moderate-to-severe adverse event and was manageable and reversible. No deaths were reported. Objective responses were achieved in 18 of 32 patients with measurable disease (56% [90% CI, 40%-71%]) and in 9 of 22 evaluable patients treated at the MTD (41% [90% CI, 23%-61%]). Ixabepilone clearance and the epirubicin pharmacokinetic profile were similar across ixabepilone dose levels. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of ixabepilone and epirubicin was clinically active. The recommended dose for evaluation in phase II is epirubicin 75 mg/m(2), followed by ixabepilone 30 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks.",1
"Classical markers like ER and ki-67, but also survivin and pERK, could be involved in the pathological response to gemcitabine, adriamycin and paclitaxel (GAT) in locally advanced breast cancer patients: results from the GEICAM/2002-01 phase II study.","INTRODUCTION: The identification and validation of biomarkers of chemotherapy sensitivity is critical in order to individualise therapy in breast cancer. We evaluated pathological complete response (pCR) to GAT, and its correlation with tumour biomarkers before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Stage III (and stage II with T≥5 cm) breast cancer patients were included. Treatment consisted of adriamycin (40 mg/m(2)) day 1, and paclitaxel (150 mg/ m(2)) followed by gemcitabine (2000 mg/m(2)) day 2, every 14 days for six cycles. Tissue from pre-treatment biopsy and surgery was evaluated for biologic markers by immunohistochemistry. Two XPD single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were also analysed. RESULTS: Forty-six patients entered the trial. Median age was 49.5 years (range 31-72); 25 patients (54%) were pre-menopausal; 12 (26%) were ER-PgR-negative; pCR was observed in 17% (95% CI: 6.4-28.4) of patients. Significant differences in marker expression (mean±SD) in correlation to pathological response were only found in Ki- 67. After treatment, tumours showed lower Ki-67-, surviving- and pERK-positive cells. No correlation between XPD polymorphisms and pCR was found. The overall response rate was 89% (95% CI: 80.1-98.1). Fifteen patients (33%) underwent breast-conserving surgery. The most frequent grade 3 or 4 toxicities were neutropenia (with one febrile neutropenia) and asthenia. CONCLUSION: These results show an effective regimen with acceptable tolerability. Our data suggest that not only classical markers (ER, Ki-67), but also survivin and pERK could be involved in the response to GAT, which may contribute to therapy individualisation in future study designs.",0
The BOLERO-2 trial: the addition of everolimus to exemestane in the treatment of postmenopausal hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer.,"The combination of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus with the aromatase inhibitor exemestane was evaluated in the randomized Phase III BOLERO-2 trial. Research has indicated that aberrant signaling through the mTOR pathway is associated with resistance to endocrine therapies. The BOLERO-2 trial examined the effects on progression-free survival of the addition of everolimus to exemestane in a patient population of postmenopausal, hormone receptor-positive, advanced breast cancer. At the interim analysis, the median progression-free survival assessed by local investigators was 6.9 months for everolimus plus exemestane versus 2.8 months for placebo plus exemestane (hazard ratio: 0.43; p < 0.001), and by central assessment was 10.6 versus 4.1 months, respectively (hazard ratio: 0.36; p < 0.001). The everolimus plus exemestane arm showed greater number of grade 3 and 4 adverse events. This study suggests that the addition of everolimus to exemestane is a potential viable treatment option for this patient population.",1
Phase II study of oxaliplatin plus leucovorin and 5-fluorouracil in heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer patients.,"The aim of this phase II study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (LV) in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients heavily pretreated with anthracyclines, taxanes, vinorelbine, gemcitabine, and capecitabine. Sixty-two women who had received at least 3 above-mentioned drug classes were treated with oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2) as a 2-h infusion on day 1, LV 200 mg/m(2) as a 2-h infusion followed by bolus 5-FU 400 mg/m(2) on day 1, and a continuous infusion of 5-FU 1,200 mg/m(2) for 44 h. The median patient age was 52 years with a median of two involved organs, and the metastases were mostly in the lung (53.2%), lymph nodes (51.6%), and liver (45.2%). Patients had a median of three prior chemotherapy regimens. Forty-five patients (72.6%) had prior exposure to all 5 classes of drugs. Based on an intention-to-treat analysis, 60 patients were assessable for responses and 11 patients achieved a partial response (PR), giving an overall response rate (ORR) of 18.3%. Twenty-one (35%) patients had stable disease (SD), and of these, 8 achieved long SD (13.3%). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3 months, and the median overall survival (OS) was 10 months. Toxicity was mild to moderate with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and neuropathy occurring in 14 (22.6%), 9 (14.5%), and 3 (4.8%) patients, respectively. The study demonstrated that the combination of oxaliplatin plus 5-FU/LV was a well-tolerated salvage regimen with moderate activity in patients with heavily pretreated MBC.",1
Evaluating health-related quality-of-life therapeutic effectiveness in a clinical trial with extensive nonignorable missing data and heterogeneous response: results from a phase III randomized trial of gemcitabine plus paclitaxel versus paclitaxel monotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: This manuscript presents health-related quality of life (HRQL) results from a phase III trial of gemcitabine-paclitaxel (GT) versus paclitaxel (T) in metastatic breast cancer patients. METHODS: Patients completed the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist (RSCL) and Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) at baseline and at the end of each cycle. Sensitivity analyses for six longitudinal pattern mixture models (PMMs) assessed potential bias due to informative dropout. Cumulative probability plots with 50% confidence intervals indicated the proportion of patients whose HRQL was likely to improve, decline, or stay the same. RESULTS: Sensitivity analyses addressing nonignorable missing RSCL data included 351 patients. The mean RSCL global HRQL score for GT was significantly and consistently better than that for T (all PMMs P < 0.040). The slope estimate of 1.5 points (100-point scale) per cycle from one PMM translated to a clinically significant 9-point improvement over six cycles with GT versus T. For GT, ~25% of patients were more likely than not to have improved HRQL, whereas that proportion for T was ~5%. PMMs showed no consistent treatment arm differences for BPI or other RSCL outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Adding gemcitabine to paclitaxel for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer is more likely to improve global HRQL over time compared to monotherapy treatment.",0
Locally advanced breast cancer: MR imaging for prediction of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy--results from ACRIN 6657/I-SPY TRIAL.,"PURPOSE: To compare magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings and clinical assessment for prediction of pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in patients with stage II or III breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The HIPAA-compliant protocol and the informed consent process were approved by the American College of Radiology Institutional Review Board and local-site institutional review boards. Women with invasive breast cancer of 3 cm or greater undergoing NACT with an anthracycline-based regimen, with or without a taxane, were enrolled between May 2002 and March 2006. MR imaging was performed before NACT (first examination), after one cycle of anthracyline-based treatment (second examination), between the anthracycline-based regimen and taxane (third examination), and after all chemotherapy and prior to surgery (fourth examination). MR imaging assessment included measurements of tumor longest diameter and volume and peak signal enhancement ratio. Clinical size was also recorded at each time point. Change in clinical and MR imaging predictor variables were compared for the ability to predict pathologic complete response (pCR) and residual cancer burden (RCB). Univariate and multivariate random-effects logistic regression models were used to characterize the ability of tumor response measurements to predict pathologic outcome, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) used as a summary statistic. RESULTS: Data in 216 women (age range, 26-68 years) with two or more imaging time points were analyzed. For prediction of both pCR and RCB, MR imaging size measurements were superior to clinical examination at all time points, with tumor volume change showing the greatest relative benefit at the second MR imaging examination. AUC differences between MR imaging volume and clinical size predictors at the early, mid-, and posttreatment time points, respectively, were 0.14, 0.09, and 0.02 for prediction of pCR and 0.09, 0.07, and 0.05 for prediction of RCB. In multivariate analysis, the AUC for predicting pCR at the second imaging examination increased from 0.70 for volume alone to 0.73 when all four predictor variables were used. Additional predictive value was gained with adjustments for age and race. CONCLUSION: MR imaging findings are a stronger predictor of pathologic response to NACT than clinical assessment, with the greatest advantage observed with the use of volumetric measurement of tumor response early in treatment.",0
A phase 1 study of weekly dosing of trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in patients with advanced human epidermal growth factor 2-positive breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: We conducted a phase 1, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study (TDM3569g) to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single-agent trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) administered weekly and once every 3 weeks in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab. The weekly dose results are described here. METHODS: Patients were administered escalating doses of T-DM1 weekly, starting at 1.2 mg/kg. Additional patients were enrolled at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) to better characterize tolerability and pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients received weekly T-DM1, and the MTD was determined to be 2.4 mg/kg. In general, T-DM1 was well tolerated, requiring few dose modifications or discontinuations because of adverse events (AEs). Grade ≥3 AEs were reported in 19 patients (67.9%); treatment-related AEs occurred in 25 (89.3%) patients. Exposure to weekly T-DM1 was dose-proportional at ≥1.2 mg/kg, and accumulation of T-DM1 and total trastuzumab was observed. Objective partial tumor responses were reported in 13 (46.4%) patients; the median duration of response was 18.6 months, and the 6-month clinical benefit rate was 57.1%. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that a weekly dose of T-DM1 2.4 mg/kg has antitumor activity and is well tolerated in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.

Safety results from a phase III study (TURANDOT trial by CECOG) of first-line bevacizumab in combination with capecitabine or paclitaxel for HER-2-negative locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: We report safety data from a randomised, phase III study (CECOG/BC.1.3.005) evaluating first-line bevacizumab plus paclitaxel or capecitabine for locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients aged ⩾18years with human epidermal growth factor receptor-2-negative breast adenocarcinoma were randomised to Arm A: bevacizumab 10mg/kg days 1 and 15; paclitaxel 90mg/m(2) days 1, 8, and 15, every 4weeks; or Arm B: bevacizumab 15mg/kg day 1; capecitabine 1000mg/m(2) b.i.d., days 1-14, every 3weeks, until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or consent withdrawal. RESULTS: A post hoc interim safety analysis included 561 patients (Arm A: 284, Arm B: 277). The regimens demonstrated similar frequencies of all-grade and serious adverse events (SAEs), but different safety profiles. Treatment-related events occurred in 85.2% (Arm A) and 78.0% (Arm B) of patients. Fatigue was most common in Arm A (30.6% versus 23.5% Arm B), and hand-foot syndrome (HFS) most common in Arm B (49.5% versus 2.5% Arm A). Diarrhoea (Arm A: 0.4%, Arm B: 1.4%) and pulmonary embolism (Arm A: 0.7%, Arm B: 1.1%) were the most frequently reported SAEs. CONCLUSION: These findings are in-line with safety data for bevacizumab plus paclitaxel or capecitabine, reported in previous phase III trials.",0
"A multicenter phase II study of TSU-68, a novel oral multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in patients with metastatic breast cancer progressing despite prior treatment with an anthracycline-containing regimen and taxane.","PURPOSE: TSU-68 is a novel multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, platelet-derived growth factor receptor and fibroblast growth factor receptor. TSU-68 demonstrated a strong anti-tumor effect against established human breast cancer xenografts in nude mice without apparent toxicity. We conducted a phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TSU-68 monotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer progressing despite prior treatment with an anthracycline-containing regimen and taxane. METHODS: TSU-68 was administered daily at a dose of 400 mg twice a day after meals in 20 patients. The primary endpoint was objective overall response rate according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors guideline version 1.0. Secondary endpoints included clinical benefit rate (complete response, partial response and stable disease lasting for at least 24 weeks), exploratory assessments of change in mRNA levels of biological markers associated with angiogenesis in tumor tissue at the end of Cycle 1, and safety of TSU-68. RESULTS: Twenty patients were enrolled into the study from October 2002 through April 2003. TSU-68 monotherapy produced objective overall response in none of the patients; however, clinical benefit was seen in 5 % of the patients. The mRNA levels of CD31, Flt-1 and Flk-1/KDR showed a decreasing trend in all 4 patients who provided additional written informed consent for collection of tumor tissue. However, no significant difference was observed in the change in mRNA level due to the small sample size. The most common adverse drug reaction (ADR) was tumor pain (60 %); hematological ADRs rarely occurred, and they were mild in severity. Only one patient experienced grade 2 rash and no patient experienced hypertension. No patients experienced a grade 4 ADR and no episode of death related to the study treatment occurred in the 20 patients. CONCLUSIONS: TSU-68 monotherapy produced clinical benefit in only 5 % of the patients and did not produce objective overall response; however, the treatment was well tolerated. Further evaluation of the efficacy of TSU-68 will be worthwhile because the mRNA levels of CD31, Flt-1 and Flk-1/KDR decreased in 4 patients.",1
Phase II study of irinotecan plus capecitabine in anthracycline- and taxane- pretreated patients with metastatic breast cancer.,"To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of combined treatment with irinotecan (I) and capecitabine (X), we conducted a phase II study of the IX combination in anthracycline- and taxane-pretreated patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Patients received 80 mg/m(2) I on days 1 and 8 and 1,000 mg/m(2) X twice daily on days 1-14 of 21-day cycles until disease progression. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR), and the secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. Thirty-six patients were enrolled between September 2006 and April 2008. The median follow-up was 47.6 months. The ORR was 58.3 % (95 % CI, 42.2-72.9), with 3 complete responses and 18 partial responses. The median PFS was 7.6 months (95 % CI, 5.0-10.2), and the median OS was 20.0 months (95 % CI, 11.6-28.4). Neutropenia was the most common adverse event (grade 3, 30.6 %; grade 4, 27.8 %) with febrile neutropenia in 2 patients (5.6 %). Three patients (8.3 %) had grade 3 diarrhea, 3 patients (8.3 %) had grade 3 asthenia, and 1 patient (2.8 %) had grade 3 hand-foot syndrome. The IX combination was effective and tolerable for anthracycline- and taxane-pretreated patients with MBC. A phase III trial of this combination is ongoing.",1
Weekly paclitaxel plus trastuzumab in metastatic breast cancer pretreated with anthracyclines-a phase II multipractice study.,"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The 3-weekly combination of trastuzumab and paclitaxel has been approved for the treatment of advanced breast cancer based on a large pivotal study. However, mono and combination chemotherapy trials suggest that weekly paclitaxel has a better therapeutic index, especially in the palliative setting. The present trial examined the efficacy and safety of weekly paclitaxel over a limited duration combined with continued trastuzumab in HER2+ patients. METHODS: Patients with histologically confirmed metastatic breast cancer overexpressing HER2 were eligible if pretreated with anthracycline in either the adjuvant or palliative setting. Treatment consisted of weekly trastuzumab (2 mg/kg/week for up to one year after a loading dose of 4 mg/kg in week 1) and paclitaxel (90 mg/m², administered in weeks 1-6 and 8-13). RESULTS: Twenty-seven German centers enrolled 121 patients. The median number of metastatic sites was two (range 1-5); 38% of patients had received chemotherapy for advanced disease. After a median 42 weeks of trastuzumab treatment, limited by disease progression in roughly half the patients, a best objective response rate (complete response + partial response) of 76% was achieved, including complete remissions in 29%. 74% of patients lived without tumor progression at six months. Median progression-free and overall survival were 9.4 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.1-11.3) and 22 months (95% CI: 17-46). After alopecia, Common Toxicity Criteria grade ≥2 toxicity was predominantly hematological (leukopenia [31%] and anemia [41%]); however, thrombocytopenia occurred in only 5%. Neurotoxicity was remarkably low. Two cardiac events (grades 2 and 3) were presumed treatment-related. CONCLUSIONS: Weekly paclitaxel plus trastuzumab allows an increased dose density and offers an attractive and effective alternative to the conventional schedule. Limiting the duration of cytotoxic therapy to 3 months seems to be an option to reduce neurotoxicity without impairing long-term outcome.",1
A multicenter randomized phase III trial of vinorelbine/gemcitabine doublet versus capecitabine monotherapy in anthracycline- and taxane-pretreated women with metastatic breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: The Breast Cancer Study Group of the Hellenic Oncology Research Group conducted a phase III trial of single-agent capecitabine versus the vinorelbine/gemcitabine doublet in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) pretreated with anthracyclines and taxanes. The primary objective was to demonstrate superiority of combination treatment in terms of progression-free survival (PFS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women with MBC were randomly assigned to receive either capecitabine (Cap arm: 1250 mg/m(2) twice daily, on days 1-14) or vinorelbine/gemcitabine doublet (VG arm: vinorelbine 25 mg/m(2); gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2); both drugs on days 1 and 15). RESULTS: Seventy-four women were treated on each arm and median PFS was 5.4 versus 5.2 months (P = 0.736), for VG and Cap, respectively. Median overall survival was 20.4 months for the VG arm and 22.4 months for the Cap arm (P = 0.319). Overall response rate was 28.4% in the VG arm and 24.3% in the Cap arm (P = 0.576). Both regimens were generally well tolerated. Neutropenia and fatigue were more common with VG arm and hand-foot syndrome with Cap arm. CONCLUSIONS: This trial failed to demonstrate superiority of vinorelbine/gemcitabine doublet over single-agent capecitabine in terms of PFS. Given the favorable toxicity and convenience of oral administration, single-agent capecitabine is recommended for compliant patients.",1
A phase 1 study of weekly everolimus (RAD001) in combination with docetaxel in patients with metastatic breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin with everolimus may improve the efficacy of taxanes. Everolimus and docetaxel are both metabolized by CYP3A4, which could result in a pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction. METHODS: Fifteen patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with docetaxel (doses of 40-75 mg/m(2) intravenously on day 1 of a 21-day cycle) in combination with everolimus (doses ranging from 20 to 50 mg orally on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle) in a phase 1 trial using the continuous reassessment method to determine maximum tolerated dose. The first 2 patients developed a dose-limiting toxicity (neutropenic infection), prompting a mandatory dose reduction and PK evaluation of both everolimus and docetaxel for patients enrolled in subsequent dosing cohorts. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were treated. Dose-limiting toxicity included grade 3 mucositis (n = 1), prolonged grade 4 neutropenia (n = 1), and grade 3 infection/febrile neutropenia (n = 3). Day 8 of everolimus was commonly held for neutropenia despite a dose reduction in docetaxel to 40 mg/m(2). Eleven patients underwent complete PK evaluation for everolimus, and 9 patients underwent complete PK evaluation for both everolimus and docetaxel. Widely variable changes in clearance were seen for both drugs, and the study was terminated because of lack of efficacy and concerns regarding toxicity seen with the combination. CONCLUSIONS: Weekly everolimus in combination with docetaxel every 3 weeks was associated with excessive neutropenia and variable clearance of both drugs, making combination therapy unpredictable, even at low doses of both drugs.",1
A multicenter phase II trial of docetaxel plus gemcitabine as salvage treatment in anthracycline- and taxane-pretreated patients with metastatic breast cancer.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the docetaxel-gemcitabine (DG) combination administered every 2 weeks as salvage therapy in anthracycline- and taxane-pretreated patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). PATIENTS AND TREATMENT: Thirty women with MBC who had disease progression after chemotherapy with anthracyclines, or anthracyclines and taxanes were treated with docetaxel 50 mg/m² and gemcitabine 1,500 mg/m² on days 1 and 14 in cycles of 28 days. All patients had received prior anthracyclines, and fourteen (46.6%) had also received prior taxanes. All patients were evaluable for toxicity and 24 for response to treatment. RESULTS: Complete response occurred in four (13.3%) patients and partial response in 10 (33.3%) for an overall response rate of 46.7% (95% CI 28.8-64.5). Seven patients (23.3%) had stable disease and nine (30%) progressive disease. Of the 14 patients previously treated with both anthracyclines and taxanes, seven (50%) responded. The median duration of response was 4.8 months (range 1.9-15.3), the median time to disease progression 6.6 months (range 0.5-16.9) and the median overall survival 16.8 months (range 1.3-53.2). There was no treatment-related toxic death. Neutropenia was the only grade 4 toxicity occurring in three (10%) patients. None of them developed neutropenic fever. Grade 3 thrombocytopenia occurred in two (6.7%) patients. Non-hematological toxicities were manageable. CONCLUSION: The DG combination administered biweekly is very well tolerated and effective in anthracycline- and taxane-pretreated patients with MBC. A previous treatment with taxanes does not preclude a good clinical response to this regimen.",1
A phase II multicenter study of two different dosages of pemetrexed given in combination with cyclophosphamide as first-line treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.,"Pemetrexed/cyclophosphamide was evaluated as first-line treatment for patients with locally advanced/metastatic breast cancer. In this randomized phase II study (NCT00190671), therapy consisted of either 600 mg/m(2) (P600) or 1,800 mg/m(2) (P1800) pemetrexed, followed by 600 mg/m(2) cyclophosphamide, every 21 days; 103 females (42 P600; 61 P1800) were enrolled. P600 was discontinued, as response rate (19.1%) was lower than targeted. In the P1800 arm, 20 patients had partial response (32.8%; 95% CI: 21.0-44.6) and 26 (42.6%) had stable disease. Median progression-free survival was 6.3 months (range: 0.3-31.1). P1800 plus cyclophosphamide 600 represents a regimen of reasonable efficacy and acceptable tolerability.",1
Phase I-II study of vorinostat plus paclitaxel and bevacizumab in metastatic breast cancer: evidence for vorinostat-induced tubulin acetylation and Hsp90 inhibition in vivo.,"In preclinical models, the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat sensitizes breast cancer cells to tubulin-polymerizing agents and to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor-directed therapies. We sought to determine the safety and efficacy of vorinostat plus paclitaxel and bevacizumab as first-line therapy in metastatic breast cancer (MBC), and the biological effects of vorinostat in vivo. For this purpose of this study, 54 patients with measurable disease and no prior chemotherapy for MBC received vorinostat (200 or 300 mg PO BID) on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17, plus paclitaxel (90 mg/m(2)) on days 2, 9, 16, and bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) on days 2 and 16 every 28 days. The primary objective of the phase I study was to determine the recommended phase II dose (RPTD) of vorinostat, and for the phase II to detect an improvement of response rate from 40 to 60% (alpha = 0.10, beta = 0.10). No dose limiting toxicities were observed, and the RPTD of vorinostat was 300 mg BID. For the primary efficacy analysis in 44 patients at the RPTD, we observed 24 objective responses (55%, 95% confidence intervals (C.I) 39%, 70%). The adverse event profile was consistent with paclitaxel-bevacizumab, with the exception of increased diarrhea with the addition of vorinostat. Analysis of serial tumor biopsies in seven patients showed increased acetylation of Hsp90 and α-tubulin following vorinostat. Vorinostat induces histone and alpha tubulin acetylation and functional inhibition of Hsp90 in breast cancer in vivo and can be safely combined with paclitaxel and bevacizumab.",1
The efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemotherapy +/- letrozole in postmenopausal women with locally advanced breast cancer: a randomized phase III clinical trial.,"This two-arm randomized clinical study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant concurrent chemotherapy and letrozole in postmenopausal women with locally advanced breast carcinoma. One hundred and one postmenopausal women aged 50-83 years with pathologically proven locally advanced (clinical stage T3, T4 and/or N2, N3) breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone (control arm, n = 51) or neoadjuvant chemotherapy concurrent with letrozole 2.5 mg (study arm, n = 50). Chemotherapy consisted of a median 4 (range 3-5) cycles of intravenous 5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m(2), doxorubicin 60 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2), every three weeks. All patients subsequently underwent modified radical mastectomy approximately two weeks after the last cycle of chemotherapy. Pathologic complete response rates were 25.5% and 10.2% in the study and the control group, respectively (P = 0.049). Similarly, clinical complete response rates were 27.6% and 10.2% in the study and the control group, respectively (P = 0.037). In the subgroup analysis of hormone receptor-positive cases, the complete response rates were more prominent in study group compared with control group. Common treatment-related side effects such as nausea, vomiting, bone marrow suppression, and mucositis were similar in both groups, but hot flush was more prevalent in study group compared with control group (P = 0.023). The addition of letrozole concurrently with neoadjuvant chemotherapy provides a higher clinical and pathologic response rates with acceptable toxicity compared with chemotherapy alone in postmenopausal women with locally advanced sensitive breast cancer.",1
"Locally advanced breast cancers are more likely to present as Interval Cancers: results from the I-SPY 1 TRIAL (CALGB 150007/150012, ACRIN 6657, InterSPORE Trial).","Interval cancers (ICs), defined as cancers detected between regular screening mammograms, have been shown to be of higher grade, larger size, and associated with lower survival, compared with screen-detected cancers (SDCs) and comprise 17% of cancers from population-based screening programs. We sought to determine the frequency of ICs in a study of locally advanced breast cancers, the I-SPY 1 TRIAL. Screening was defined as having a mammogram with 2 years, and the proportion of ICs at 1 and 2 years was calculated for screened patients. Differences in clinical characteristics for ICs versus SDCs and screened versus non-screened cancers were assessed. For the 219 evaluable women, mean tumor size was 6.8 cm. Overall, 80% of women were over 40 and eligible for screening; however, only 31% were getting screened. Among women screened, 85% were ICs, with 68% diagnosed within 1 year of a previously normal mammogram. ICs were of higher grade (49% vs. 10%) than SDCs. Among non-screened women, 28% (43/152) were younger than the recommended screening age of 40. Of the entire cohort, 12% of cancers were mammographically occult (MO); the frequency of MO cancers did not differ between screened (11%) and non-screened (15%). ICs were common in the I-SPY 1 TRIAL suggesting the potential need for new approaches beyond traditional screening to reduce mortality in women who present with larger palpable cancers.",0
A phase I study of vinflunine in combination with capecitabine in patients with metastatic breast cancer previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes.,"PURPOSE: A phase I study was performed to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD), recommended dose (RD), safety and efficacy of vinflunine when combined with capecitabine in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes, with pharmacokinetic blood sampling to test potential drug-drug interactions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with MBC who had received anthracyclines and taxanes in the neo/adjuvant setting, if progression occurred during or within 12 months of chemotherapy completion, and/or as first-line chemotherapy of MBC were enrolled. Vinflunine (VFL) was given on day 1 with capecitabine (CAPE) twice daily from days 1 to 14, every 3 weeks. Three dose levels (DL) were investigated (DL1: VFL 280 mg/m² and CAPE 1,650 mg/m²/day, DL2: VFL 320 mg/m² and CAPE 1,650 mg/m²/day and DL3: VFL 280 mg/m² and CAPE 2,000 mg/m²/day). RESULTS: The RD was established as vinflunine 280 mg/m² on day 1 plus capecitabine 1,650 mg/m²/day on days 1 to 14 given every 3 weeks. Dose-limiting toxicities were grade 4 neutropenia lasting at least 7 days for 2 patients, anorexia with fatigue for 1 patient and diarrhoea with fatigue, anorexia and febrile neutropenia for 1 patient. Neutropenia was the main toxicity of the combination, it was reported in 15 patients (93.8%) with grade 3 in 7 patients (43.8%) and 22.6% of cycles and grade 4 in 7 patients (43.8%) and 19.8% of cycles. Complications were rare with only one patient experiencing febrile neutropenia at DL exceeding the RD. The most frequent non-haematological toxicities were fatigue and gastrointestinal disorders; however, no grade 3 or 4 episode was observed at the RD. Hand-foot syndrome was reported in 5 patients (31.3%) and 22.6% of cycles, no episode of grade 3 was seen. Concerning pharmacokinetics, no modifications were detected for VFL, while slight accumulation between days 1 and 14 was observed for 5-FU formed from CAPE. The risk of clinical significant drug-drug interaction was considered weak. Objective partial responses were reported in 7 patients, yielding a response rate of 43.8% in the all-treated population according to the investigator assessment. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of vinflunine and capecitabine is safe and showed promising antitumour activity in MBC patients who have failed prior anthracyclines and taxanes. Further clinical development of this combination is warranted.",1
Oral vinorelbine in metastatic breast cancer: a review of current clinical trial results.,"BACKGROUND: Oral chemotherapy is one of the options for the treatment of endocrine non-responsive metastatic breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A search of the online PubMed database was undertaken to identify clinical trials evaluating oral vinorelbine in metastatic breast cancer. All the clinically relevant data have been analysed in this article. RESULTS: A total of 31 studies including more than 1000 patients have been included into this analysis. Oral vinorelbine either as a single-agent or in combination has shown consistent efficacy results (response rates between 27% and 85% in first-line). The all-oral combination of oral vinorelbine and capecitabine has shown comparable efficacy to a taxane-based combination in a randomised phase II study. Importantly, activity has also been observed in the subset of patients previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes. For HER2-positive patients, oral vinorelbine in combination with trastuzumab is among the most active options. Oral vinorelbine presents a manageable tolerance profile. Neutropenia is the most common adverse event and alopecia is not frequently observed. Anti-emetic prophylaxis is recommended. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these data indicate that oral vinorelbine is a highly effective and well tolerated agent which can be used in first-line and subsequent metastatic breast cancer settings. Moreover, this compound may offer the specific advantages of oral chemotherapy, as fewer and shorter hospital visits, delayed use of central venous access devices and maintained social activities.",0
"Phase II trial of exemestane in combination with fulvestrant in postmenopausal women with advanced, hormone-responsive breast cancer.","INTRODUCTION: Exemestane, the irreversible steroidal aromatase inhibitor, and fulvestrant, the pure estrogen antagonist, are active as single drugs in postmenopausal women with advanced hormone-responsive breast cancer. We designed a phase II study with the purpose of determining whether combining these 2 drugs with different and potentially complementary mechanisms of action will improve the clinical benefit. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty postmenopausal women with hormone-responsive advanced breast cancer received intramuscular injection of fulvestrant 250 mg every 28 days in combination with daily exemestane 25 mg until disease progression. We examined the influence of fulvestrant on exemestane pharmacokinetics and the effect of exemestane and fulvestrant on serum IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) and IGFBP-3 (IGF-binding protein 3) levels. RESULTS: The observed proportion of patients free of progressive disease at 6 months after the initiation of treatment with exemestane and fulvestrant was 50%, a rate similar to that achieved with single-agent exemestane or fulvestrant in the first- or second-line setting. Pharmacokinetics parameters showed that coadministration of fulvestrant did not result in clinically relevant changes in exemestane plasma concentrations. A comparison of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels demonstrated the increase of 35% and 12%, respectively, in mean levels from baseline to day 120. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of exemestane and fulvestrant did not improve clinical benefit. The observed lack of improved efficacy was not related to altered drug exposure.",1
Phase II interventional study (N0337) of capecitabine in combination with vinorelbine and trastuzumab for first- or second-line treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer: a north central cancer treatment group trial.,"BACKGROUND: We conducted a multiinstitutional phase II study of capecitabine in combination with vinorelbine and trastuzumab in patients eligible to receive first- or second-line treatment for human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)-positive (HER2(+)) metastatic breast cancer (MBC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was designed to test that the true confirmed response rate (CRR) was at most 45% vs. a true CRR of at least 65%. Between March 2005 and June 2008, eligible patients received capecitabine 825 mg/m² orally on days 1 to 14, vinorelbine 25 mg/m² intravenously on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks, and trastuzumab 8 mg/kg intravenously on day 1 week 1 and 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks. The main outcome measure was CRR. RESULTS: Of 47 women accrued, 45 were evaluable. This design required at least 25 confirmed responses in the 45 evaluable patients for the treatment to be considered promising. Thirty women (67%) achieved a confirmed response; 25 women (56%) had a confirmed partial response (PR); 5 women (11%) had confirmed complete responses (CRs). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 11.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.4-16.7 months). Median overall survival was 28.5 months (95% CI, 24.8-36.4 months). CONCLUSIONS: This triplet combination demonstrated promising activity in patients with HER2(+) MBC.",1
Phase II multicenter trial of albumin-bound paclitaxel and capecitabine in first-line treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Capecitabine, a tumor-activated oral fluoropyrimidine, and albumin-bound paclitaxel (ab-paclitaxel) have substantial single-agent activity in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Taxane and antimetabolite doublets have improved efficacy compared with single agents. This phase II open-label trial was designed to test the safety and efficacy of capecitabine and ab-paclitaxel in previously untreated MBC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received capecitabine (825 mg/m(2) orally twice daily, approximately 12 hours apart, on days 1 to 15) and ab-paclitaxel (125 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1 and 8 of each cycle with no premedication) every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was overall objective response rate (ORR), with evaluation performed after every 2 cycles. Entry criteria included measurable MBC, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negativity, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2, no previous chemotherapy for metastatic disease, and > 6 months since adjuvant fluoropyrimidine or paclitaxel treatment. RESULTS: Fifty patients received at least 1 dose of study drug, with 46 patients evaluable for efficacy evaluation. Three hundred seventy-four cycles of therapy were delivered. Eighty percent of patients completed 8 cycles. The ORR was 61% (complete response [CR], 4%; partial response [PR], 57%), and 7 patients had sustained (≥ 24 weeks) stable disease for a clinical benefit rate of 76.1%. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 10.6 months, and the median overall survival was 19.9 months. The most common adverse events (AEs) that were ≥ grade 3 were pain, hand-foot syndrome, and neutropenia. CONCLUSION: The combination of weekly ab-paclitaxel plus daily capecitabine orally at these doses and scheduling was well tolerated and showed substantial efficacy.",1
Phase ii trial of a metronomic schedule of docetaxel and capecitabine with concurrent celecoxib in patients with prior anthracycline exposure for metastatic breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: This phase ii clinical trial examined the activity of a metronomic dosing schedule of docetaxel and capecitabine chemotherapy in patients with advanced breast cancer. Patients also received daily oral celecoxib in an effort to improve outcome measures and to ameliorate some of the common side effects of chemotherapy. METHODS: Patients received docetaxel at a starting dose of 15 mg/m² weekly, oral capecitabine 1250 mg/m² once daily, and oral celecoxib 200 mg twice daily. The primary endpoint was clinical benefit: percentage of patients experiencing either an objective response or stable disease (sd) for more than 6 months. In the absence of significant neutropenia, the dose of docetaxel was escalated after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. Therapy was given until disease progression or development of unacceptable toxicity. The level of thymidine phosphorylase expression in peripheral white blood cells of patients was measured before and during treatment to determine the effect on this capecitabine-activating enzyme. RESULTS: Of 47 patients enrolled, 38 (81%) completed treatment to a disease endpoint. No complete responses were achieved, but 13 of the 38 patients (34%) experienced a partial response, and another 3 patients (8%) experienced sd for more than 6 months. The clinical benefit rate was therefore 42% (95% confidence interval: 27% to 57%). The median time to disease progression for all evaluable patients was 3.6 months (range: 0.9-21.7 months). The most common nonhematologic toxicities were diarrhea, plantar- palmar erythrodysesthesia, fatigue, mucositis, and vomiting. Most patients (89%) received combination chemotherapy until disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that metronomic docetaxel-capecitabine chemotherapy with daily celecoxib can produce significant anticancer activity, with predictable toxicity. Efficacy fell short of expectations, with outcome measures being similar to those obtained when the study agents are given in conventional dosing. Furthermore, there is mounting evidence to indicate that a low dose of taxanes fails to induce thymidine phosphorylase expression, an effect believed to be important in achieving therapeutic synergism when taxanes are given concurrently with capecitabine.",1
"Vandetanib with docetaxel as second-line treatment for advanced breast cancer: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized Phase II study.","PURPOSE: The aim of this Phase II study was to assess the efficacy and safety of vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in patients with pretreated advanced breast cancer. METHODS: The primary study objective was to compare the number of progression events in patients receiving once-daily oral vandetanib (100 mg) in combination with docetaxel (100 mg/m(2) iv every 21 days) versus placebo plus docetaxel. Sixty-four patients were randomized to receive study treatment (n = 35, vandetanib; n = 29, placebo). RESULTS: A slightly greater number of patients had experienced a progression event by the data cut-off in the vandetanib group (24 [69%]) compared with the placebo group (18 [62%]); HR = 1.19, two-sided 80% CI: 0.79-1.81; two-sided P = 0.59), suggesting that the addition of vandetanib to docetaxel did not affect the risk of disease progression compared with placebo plus docetaxel. The safety and tolerability profile of the combination therapy reflected those of both drugs as monotherapy agents. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with advanced breast cancer, vandetanib plus docetaxel was generally well tolerated. Clinical benefit was not different to that observed with placebo plus docetaxel. However, due to the small patient number it was not possible to yield robust results, further research is required to identify predictive factors for patient selection.",1
"Cisplatin-ifosfamide combination chemotherapy in metastatic triple-negative, anthracycline- and taxane-pretreated breast cancer patients; a phase II study.","PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of cisplatin and ifosfamide combination chemotherapy in metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes. METHODS: Patients were treated with cisplatin 20 mg/ m2 iv, days 1-5, over 30 min and ifosfamide 1200 mg/m(2) iv, days 1-5 over 2 h with mesna uroprotection. Therapy was repeated every 3 weeks. Responding patients received a maximum of 6 cycles of chemotherapy. Treatment was delayed in the event of grade 3 or higher hematologic or non hematologic toxicity until resolution to grade 2 or less. Treatment then proceeded as scheduled but with 20% dose reduction of both drugs. RESULTS: 40 TNBC patients were enrolled. Median age was 43 years (range 37-49). Thirty (75%) patients had visceral involvement. Fourteen (35%) patients achieved objective response, disease stabilization occurred in 2 (5%) patients, while disease progression occurred in 24 (60%) patients. Grade 3/4 neutropenia occurred in 11 (27.5%) patients, while grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was registered in 9 (22.5%) patients. Neurosensory toxicity was the commonest non hematologic acute severe toxicity (10%). With a median follow up of 14 months the median time to progression was 6 months and the median overall survival 12 months. Survival of responding patients was significantly better compared with non responders (p=0.000). CONCLUSION: Our outpatient cisplatin / ifosfamide regimen displayed reasonable efficacy and toxicity in TNBC. However, the outcome did not differ from relevant studies in the literature. Further molecular studies and phase III trials are still needed to further improve treatment strategies in TNBC.",1
"First-line treatment of advanced breast cancer with sunitinib in combination with docetaxel versus docetaxel alone: results of a prospective, randomized phase III study.","PURPOSE: To investigate whether sunitinib plus docetaxel improves clinical outcomes for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/neu-negative advanced breast cancer (ABC) versus docetaxel alone. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this phase III study, patients were randomly assigned to open-label combination therapy (sunitinib 37.5 mg/d, days 2 to 15 every 3 weeks; and docetaxel 75 mg/m(2), day 1 every 3 weeks) or monotherapy (docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks). Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary end point. RESULTS: Two hundred ninety-six patients were randomly assigned to combination therapy, and 297 patients were assigned to monotherapy. Median PFS times were 8.6 and 8.3 months with combination therapy and monotherapy, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.92; one-sided P = .265). The objective response rate (ORR) was significantly higher with the combination (55%) than with monotherapy (42%; one-sided P = .001). Duration of response was similar in both arms (7.5 months with the combination v 7.2 months with monotherapy). Median overall survival (OS) times were 24.8 and 25.5 months with combination therapy and monotherapy, respectively (one-sided P = .904). There were 107 deaths with the combination and 91 deaths with monotherapy. The frequency of common adverse events (AEs) was higher with the combination, as were treatment discontinuations caused by AEs. CONCLUSION: The combination of sunitinib plus docetaxel improved ORR but did not prolong either PFS or OS compared with docetaxel alone when given to an unselected HER2/neu-negative cohort as first-line treatment for ABC. Sunitinib combination therapy may also have resulted in AEs that yield an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio. The sunitinib-docetaxel regimen evaluated in this study is not recommended for further use in ABC.",1
"Eribulin mesylate for the treatment of patients with refractory metastatic breast cancer: use of a ""physician's choice"" control arm in a randomized approval trial.","This work describes the considerations that led to the approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), on November 15, 2010, of eribulin mesylate (Halaven; Eisai, Inc.) for the treatment of patients with refractory metastatic breast cancer. The FDA review focused primarily on the results of a single randomized, open-label, multicenter trial of 762 patients with refractory locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The patients were randomized to receive eribulin or any single-agent treatment of the physician's choice, selected prior to randomization. The FDA's approval of eribulin mesylate was based on demonstration of a statistically significant prolongation of overall survival (OS) in patients who had been randomized to receive eribulin. The median OS was 13.1 months in the eribulin arm compared with 10.6 months in the control arm [HR 0.81 (95% CI, 0.66-0.99); P = 0.041]. Treatment with eribulin did not show a statistically significant treatment effect [HR 0.87 (95% CI, 0.71-1.05)] on progression-free survival as determined by independent review. This approval highlights the appropriate use of an innovative trial design and shows that improvement in OS is an achievable endpoint in the setting of advanced breast cancer. On the basis of the different conclusions arising from the OS and progression-free survival results, investigators should consider using OS as a primary endpoint in clinical trials for refractory breast cancer.",0
"A multicenter phase II study of TSU-68, an oral multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in combination with docetaxel in metastatic breast cancer patients with anthracycline resistance.","BACKGROUND: TSU-68 is a novel multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and fibroblast growth factor receptor. This open-label, non-comparative, multicenter phase II study evaluated TSU-68 in combination with docetaxel in patients with metastatic breast cancer that had relapsed within 1 year despite prior treatment with an anthracycline-containing regimen. METHODS: TSU-68 was orally administered on days 1-21, and docetaxel was intravenously delivered on day 1. The regimen was repeated every 21 days. Primary endpoint was objective response rate according to the RECIST guidelines version 1.0. RESULTS: TSU-68 in combination with docetaxel produced objective responses in 21.1% and clinical benefits in 42.1% of the patients, respectively (1 complete response, 3 partial response, and 4 stable disease for at least 24 weeks, n = 19). Median time to progression was 148 days, and median overall survival was 579 days. The common adverse drug reactions were leukopenia, neutropenia, nail disorder, malaise, dysgeusia, alopecia, and edema. CONCLUSIONS: TSU-68 in combination with docetaxel showed a promising antitumor response with manageable toxicity in patients with anthracycline-resistant metastatic breast cancer. Further studies are warranted in a different population of breast cancer or other solid cancers.",1
"Phase II study of single-agent bosutinib, a Src/Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer pretreated with chemotherapy.","BACKGROUND: This phase II study evaluated single-agent bosutinib in pretreated patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received oral bosutinib 400 mg/day. The primary end point was the progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 16 weeks. Secondary end points included objective response rate, clinical benefit rate, 2-year overall survival rate, safety, and changes in levels of bone resorption/formation biomarkers. RESULTS: Seventy-three patients were enrolled and treated. Median time from diagnosis of metastatic disease to initiation of bosutinib treatment was 24.5 months. For the intent-to-treat population, the PFS rate at 16 weeks was 39.6%. Unexpectedly, all responding patients (n = 4) were hormone receptor positive. The clinical benefit rate was 27.4%. The 2-year overall survival rate was 26.4%. The main toxic effects were diarrhea (66%), nausea (55%), and vomiting (47%). Grade 3-4 laboratory aminotransferase elevations occurred in 14 (19%) patients. Myelosuppression was minimal. No consistent changes in the levels of bone resorption/formation biomarkers were seen. CONCLUSIONS: Bosutinib showed promising efficacy in prolonging time to progression in chemotherapy-pretreated patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Bosutinib was generally well tolerated, with a safety profile different from that of the Src/Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib in a similar patient population.",1
High independent prognostic and predictive value of circulating tumor cells compared with serum tumor markers in a large prospective trial in first-line chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer patients.,"BACKGROUND: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are a prognostic marker in metastatic breast cancer, but comparisons with serum tumor markers (CA 15-3, carcinoembryonic antigen and lactate dehydrogenase) variations are needed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: CTCs were counted with CellSearch® at baseline, before cycle 2 (C2) and cycle 3 or 4 (C3/4) in 267 metastatic breast cancer patients on first-line chemotherapy with/without targeted therapy. RESULTS: Baseline CTC detection rate was 65% with ≥1 CTC/7.5 ml threshold and 44% with ≥5 CTC/7.5 ml and was independent of subtypes (luminal, triple negative, human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)+). CTCs were associated with tumor markers, bone/liver involvement, tumor burden and performance status. CTC detection ≥1 CTC/7.5 ml was a strong prognostic factor for progression-free survival (PFS), P < 0.0001. Threshold of CTC ≥5 was statistically significant for PFS and overall survival (OS), P = 0.03 on multivariate analysis. Among patients with ≥5 CTC/7.5 ml at baseline, 50% had <5 CTC/7.5 ml at C2. Changes were correlated with both PFS and OS (P < 0.0001). All patients receiving anti-HER2 therapy had <5 CTC/7.5 ml after three cycles of treatment. CONCLUSION: This is the largest prospective series validating the prognostic value of CTC independently from serum tumor marker. Elevated CTCs before C2 are an early predictive marker of poor PFS and OS, which could be used to monitor treatment benefit. CTC decrease under treatment seems stronger with targeted therapy.",0
Randomized phase II non-inferiority study (NO16853) of two different doses of capecitabine in combination with docetaxel for locally advanced/metastatic breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: This phase II study investigated whether a lower-than-approved dose of capecitabine, plus docetaxel (XT), would improve tolerability versus standard-dose XT without compromising efficacy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women aged ≥18 years with locally advanced/metastatic breast cancer resistant to anthracycline-based chemotherapy in the (neo)adjuvant, first- or second-line metastatic setting were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned to receive standard-dose XT (capecitabine 1250 mg/m(2) twice daily, days 1-14; docetaxel 75 mg/m(2), day 1 every 3 weeks) or low-dose XT (capecitabine 825 mg/m(2) twice daily, days 1-14; docetaxel as above). The primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of low-dose to standard-dose XT in terms of progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: 470 patients were randomly allocated in a 1 : 1 ratio to standard-dose or low-dose XT. Median PFS was 7.9 versus 5.8 months [hazard ratio 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95-1.43] in the standard-dose and low-dose arms, respectively. The upper limit of the 95% CI was above the predefined non-inferiority margin (1.35, P = 0.078). Secondary efficacy end points were consistent with PFS. The frequency and severity of adverse events was similar in both treatment arms. CONCLUSIONS: Non-inferiority of low-dose to standard-dose XT in terms of PFS was not demonstrated; this may be due to regional subgroup effects.",1
A phase II study of the combination of endocrine treatment and bortezomib in patients with endocrine-resistant metastatic breast cancer.,"The majority of patients with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer die from disease progression despite different types of anti-hormonal treatments. Preclinical studies have indicated that resistance to anti-hormonal therapies may be the result of an activated NF-κB signalling pathway in breast cancer. Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor that blocks the NF-κB pathway. Recent pharmacodynamic and pharmaco-kinetic xenograft studies have shown that drug exposure may be a crucial factor for the efficacy of bortezomib in solid tumours. The aim was to investigate whether the addition of bortezomib to anti-hormonal therapy would result in regained antitumour activity in patients with progressive and measurable disease being treated with an endocrine agent. Clinical benefit was defined as patients obtaining stable disease, partial response or complete response after 2 cycles, lasting for at least another five weeks. Bortezomib was administered on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of a 5-week regimen (1.6 mg/m2). Eight patients received an aromatase inhibitor and bortezomib, while one received tamoxifen and bortezomib. There were 3 grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicities. Median time to treatment failure was 69 days (range, 35-140). Two out of the 9 patients had stable disease for more than 10 weeks. Despite an effective target inhibition, suggested in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and available tumour samples, no objective antitumour responses were observed. Addition of a proteasome inhibitor to anti-hormonal therapy resulted in a clinical benefit rate of 22% in a limited number of patients with endocrine resistant and progressive metastatic breast cancer. The demonstrated proteasome inhibition in tumour tissue provides evidence that the lack of clinical responses is not attributed to deficient drug exposure.",1
A phase 2 study of sequential neoadjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine and doxorubicin followed by gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with large or locally advanced operable breast cancer: results from long-term follow-up.,"BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is being increasingly used for patients with large-size operable breast cancer. This phase 2 study of sequential NACT with gemcitabine and doxorubicin (Gem + Dox) followed by gemcitabine and cisplatin (Gem + Cis) was conducted in women with large or locally advanced breast cancer. The objectives were to evaluate the pathological complete response (pCR) rate, toxicity, pathological and genetic markers predicting response, the proportion of patients undergoing breast conservation surgery, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) after 5 years, and time to treatment failure (TtTF). In this manuscript, we report the long-term OS, PFS, and TtTF results. METHODS: Female patients aged at least 18 years with large T2 (at least 3 cm) or locally advanced (T3, T4, or N2) breast carcinoma were included. Treatment consisted of 4 cycles of Gem + Dox (gemcitabine 1,200 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8 plus doxorubicin 60 mg/m(2) on day 1 of each 21-day cycle), followed by 4 cycles of Gem + Cis (gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8 plus cisplatin 70 mg/m(2) on day 1 of each 21-day cycle), and then surgery. RESULTS: Sixty-five patients were enrolled. The pCR rate was 20%. The 5-year OS probability was 71% (95% CI 56-82%), and the 4-year PFS and TtTF probabilities were 63% (95% CI 48-74%) and 45% (95% CI 32-57%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: NACT with Gem + Dox followed by Gem + Cis was efficacious in patients with operable breast cancer.",1
Phase I study of lapatinib plus vinorelbine in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer overexpressing HER2.,"BACKGROUND: To determine the recommended doses of lapatinib (LPT) combined with vinorelbine (VNR) in women with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-overexpressing advanced breast cancer pretreated with trastuzumab. METHODS: In this phase I study, women were treated with oral daily LPT and i.v. VNR infused on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks. Dose levels (DL) of LPT (mg)/VNR (mg m(-2)) ranged from 750/20 to 1250/30. The primary end point was feasibility based on maximal tolerated dose (MTD) and maximum administered dose (MAD). Pharmacokinetic interactions were investigated. RESULTS: Of 33 patients included, 29 were evaluable. Two DLT occurred at DL4 (1000/25) meeting the MAD criteria. Despite an additional intermediate DL3' (1250/22.5), MTD was reached at DL3 (1000/22.5). Grade 3-4 neutropenia was the most common toxicity (34% and 38% of patients, respectively). Other significant toxicities included grade 3-4 diarrhoea (3% each), and grade 3 asthenia (10%). Although not statistically significant, LPT (at 1000 or 1250 mg) decreased the VNR clearance by 30-40% compared with DL1. CONCLUSION: The MTD LPT 1000 mg/VNR 22.5 mg m(-2) (DL3) is recommended for additional development. Pharmacokinetic interactions might increase the exposure to VNR and consequently alter the hematological tolerance.",1
Phase II trial of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in combination with gemcitabine in metastatic breast cancer patients.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and toxicity of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin combined with gemcitabine as first-line chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer patients in a phase II trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All breast cancer patients with HER2-negative status, hormone refractory tumor, assessable targets, with preserved performance status, and who had not received chemotherapy earlier as treatment for their metastatic disease were eligible. The patients received pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (30 mg/m(2), venous injection, day 1) concurrently with gemcitabine (1000 mg/m(2), venous injection, days 1 and 8), 1 cycle every 3 weeks. RESULTS: Although 38 patients should have been included, this study was prematurely discontinued after recruiting 20 patients because of excessive toxicity: 75% of the patients experienced grade 3 or 4 treatment-related toxicity, including neutropenia, thrombopenia, hand-foot syndrome, and stomatitis, which significantly affected the quality of life. Cardiac toxicity was mild. With regard to efficacy, 50% of the patients (95% confidence interval, 26%-74%) experienced tumor response. The response rate was 40% in patients who had earlier received anthracyclines as adjuvant therapy. Median progression-free survival and median overall survival were 8.8 months and 19 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This combination was efficient, but not well tolerated. From these results, we could not recommend these doses for further assessment and lower doses should be preferred.",1
"Multicenter, phase II, nonrandomized study of docetaxel plus trastuzumab every 21 days as the primary therapy in metastatic breast cancer overexpressing HER2.","Different anthracycline-free regimens have demonstrated activity, without serious cardiac events. This study was conducted to evaluate the activity and toxicity of docetaxel and trastuzumab given every 21 days in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). The primary endpoint was time to progression and the secondary aims included response rate, safety, duration of response, and overall survival. Eligible patients were those with MBC human epidermal growth factor receptor-2+ (HER2+) with no previous chemotherapy for advanced disease. Patients received six cycles of docetaxel (100 mg/m) plus trastuzumab (8 mg/kg loading dose and 6 mg/kg every 21 days thereafter), followed by maintenance treatment with trastuzumab monotherapy every 21 days until disease progression. Forty-nine patients with HER2+ MBC were included. The overall response rate was 44.9% (22/49). With a median follow-up of 16.6 months, the median time to progression was 8.3 months and the median overall survival was 25.7 months. Nineteen patients did not receive treatment continuation with trastuzumab monotherapy. The most common toxicity was febrile neutropenia. A total of 10 patients were taken off the study due to treatment-related toxicity, mainly cardiac events. First-line trastuzumab combined with docetaxel is an effective and well tolerated regimen for HER2+ MBC.",1
Ixabepilone plus capecitabine in advanced breast cancer patients with early relapse after adjuvant anthracyclines and taxanes: a pooled subset analysis of two phase III studies.,"BACKGROUND: Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients with rapid disease relapse after neo/adjuvant chemotherapy including anthracyclines and taxanes have limited treatment options and their efficacy is marginal. Two phase III studies compared ixabepilone plus capecitabine vs. capecitabine alone as first-line treatment in MBC patients pretreated with anthracyclines and taxanes in the neo/adjuvant setting. Here we report the efficacy and safety of these treatments in a prespecified subset of patients whose disease relapsed within 12 months. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 1973 patients across two studies, 293 relapsed within 12 months of neo/adjuvant treatment and received ixabepilone plus capecitabine (n = 149) or capecitabine alone (n = 144) as first-line chemotherapy for MBC. Analysis included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR) and toxicity. RESULTS: In 293 patients, ixabepilone plus capecitabine, as compared to capecitabine alone, increased PFS (median: 5.6 months vs. 2.8 months; hazard ratio, 0.58; p < 0.0001), ORR (46% vs. 24%) and OS (median: 15.1 months vs. 12.5 months; hazard ratio, 0.84; p = 0.208). Major toxicities of this regimen included neuropathy, neutropenia and hand-foot syndrome, but were manageable. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with breast cancer with early relapse following neo/adjuvant treatment with anthracyclines and taxanes may benefit from ixabepilone plus capecitabine.

"Higher efficacy of letrozole in combination with trastuzumab compared to letrozole monotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with HER2-positive, hormone-receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer - results of the eLEcTRA trial.","The eLEcTRA trial compared efficacy and safety of letrozole combined with trastuzumab to letrozole alone in patients with HER2 and hormone receptor (HR) positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Patients were randomized to either letrozole alone (arm A, n = 31) or letrozole plus trastuzumab (arm B, n = 26) as first-line treatment. Additional 35 patients with HER2 negative and HR positive tumors received letrozole alone (arm C). Median time to progression in arm A was 3.3 months compared to 14.1 months in arm B (hazard ratio 0.67; p = 0.23) and 15.2 months in arm C (hazard ratio 0.71; p = 0.03). Clinical benefit rate was 39% for arm A compared to 65% in arm B (odds ratio 2.99, 95% CI 1.01-8.84) and 77% in arm C (odds ratio 5.34, 95% CI 1.83-15.58). The eLEcTRA trial showed that the combination of letrozole and trastuzumab is a safe and effective treatment option for patients with HER2 positive and HR positive MBC.",1
Individually tailored treatment with epirubicin and paclitaxel with or without capecitabine as first-line chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer: a randomized multicenter trial.,"Anthracyclines and taxanes are active cytotoxic drugs in the treatment of early metastatic breast cancer. It is yet unclear whether addition of capecitabine to the combination of these drugs improves the treatment outcome. Patients with advanced breast cancer were randomized to first-line chemotherapy with a combination of epirubicin (Farmorubicin(®)) and paclitaxel (Taxol(®)) alone (ET) or in combination with capecitabine (Xeloda(®), TEX). Starting doses for ET were epirubicin 75 mg/m(2) plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2), and for TEX epirubicin 75 mg/m(2), paclitaxel 155 mg/m(2), and capecitabine 825 mg/m(2) BID for 14 days. Subsequently, doses were tailored related to side effects. Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), time to treatment failure (TTF), objective response (OR), safety and quality of life (QoL). 287 patients were randomized, 143 to ET and 144 to TEX. Median PFS was 10.8 months for patients treated with ET, and 12.4 months for those treated with TEX (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.65-1.07, P = 0.16); median OS was 26.0 months for women in the ET versus 29.7 months in the TEX arm (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.63-1.11, P = 0.22). OR was achieved in 44.8% (ET) and 54.2% (TEX), respectively (χ(2) 3.66, P = 0.16). TTF was significantly longer for patients treated with TEX, 6.0 months, versus 5.2 months following ET (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.58-0.93, P = 0.009). Severe hematological side effects related to epirubicin and paclitaxel were evenly distributed between the treatment arms, mucositis, diarrhea, and Hand-Foot syndrome were significantly more frequent in the TEX arm. Toxicity-adjusted treatment with ET and TEX showed similar efficacy in terms of PFS, OS, and OR. In this trial with limited power, the addition of capecitabine to epirubicin and paclitaxel as first-line treatment did not translate into clinically relevant improvement of the outcome.",1
"A phase II study of 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin in metastatic or locally advanced, unresectable breast cancer.","Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is an attractive target for breast cancer treatment, as it is required for the proper folding and stabilization of several proteins known to be involved in breast cancer growth and development. These proteins include the epidermal growth factor receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and src. 17-Allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) is an intravenous Hsp90 inhibitor in development for breast cancer treatment. We conducted a phase II study of 17-AAG 220 mg/m(2) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 every 21 days in patients with metastatic and locally advanced breast cancer. Since we expected the molecular effects of Hsp90 inhibition to extend beyond just ER, PR, and HER2 down regulation and to impact a variety of other cellular proteins, patients were not selected based on ER, PR, or HER2 status. Eleven patients, including 6 patients with triple negative breast cancer, were enrolled and treated. There were no responses and 3 patients had stable disease as their best response. Five patients developed grade 3/4 toxicities, which were primarily hepatic and pulmonary. Based on these results, we do not recommend further study of 17-AAG at this dosing schedule or in unselected breast cancer patients.",1
"A phase I/II prospective, single arm trial of gefitinib, trastuzumab, and docetaxel in patients with stage IV HER-2 positive metastatic breast cancer.","Inhibition of the HER-2 pathway via the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab has had a major impact in treatment of HER-2 positive breast cancer, but de novo or acquired resistance may reduce its effectiveness. The known interplay between the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and HER-2 receptors and pathways creates a rationale for combined anti-EGFR and anti-HER-2 therapy in HER-2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC), and toxicities associated with the use of multiple chemotherapeutic agents together with biological therapies may also be reduced. We conducted a prospective, single arm, phase I/II trial to determine the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of trastuzumab with the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib and docetaxel, in patients with HER-2 positive MBC. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined in the phase I portion. The primary end point of the phase II portion was progression-free survival (PFS). Immunohistochemical analysis of biomarker expression of the PKA-related proteins cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), phospho-CREB and DARPP-32 (dopamine and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of 32 kDa) plus t-DARPP (the truncated isoform of DARPP-32); PTEN; p-p70 S6K; and EGFR was conducted on tissue from metastatic sites. Nine patients were treated in the phase I portion of the study and 22 in the phase II portion. The MTD was gefitinib 250 mg on days 2-14, trastuzumab 6 mg/kg, and docetaxel 60 mg/m(2) every 21 days. For the 29 patients treated at the MTD, median PFS was 12.7 months, with complete and partial response rates of 18 and 46%, and a stable disease rate of 29%. No statistically significant correlation was found between response and expression of any biomarkers. We conclude that the combination of gefitinib, trastuzumab, and docetaxel is feasible and effective. Expression of the biomarkers examined did not predict outcome in this sample of HER-2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancer.",1
An all-oral combination of metronomic cyclophosphamide plus capecitabine in patients with anthracycline- and taxane-pretreated metastatic breast cancer: a phase II study.,"PURPOSE: Oral administration of cyclophosphamide (CTX) and capecitabine may have a greater potential for treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) due to anti-angiogenesis resulting from the metronomic dosage and upregulation of thymidine phosphorylase by CTX. The purpose of this phase II study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of an all-oral combination of metronomic CTX plus capecitabine for women with anthracycline- and taxane-pretreated MBC. METHOD: In this prospective single-center, open-label, phase II trial, patients with measurable disease received oral metronomic CTX 65 mg/m(2) daily on days 1-14 plus capecitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) twice daily on days 1-14. The treatment was repeated every 3 weeks, and continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of informed consent. The primary endpoint of the study was time to progression (TTP). RESULTS: A total of 68 patients were enrolled and received 537 cycles of chemotherapy with a median of 8 cycles (range: 1-30 cycles) per patient. Sixty-six patients were evaluated for efficacy with all patients for toxicity. With a median follow-up time of 26 months, the median time to progression was 5.2 months (95% CI, 4.2-6.2 months), and the median overall survival was 16.9 months. The overall response rate was 30.3% (95% CI, 20-43%). Clinical benefit rate was 53.0% (95% CI, 38-62%). The doublet was well tolerable, with anorexia (7.5%), the only grade 3/4 adverse events occurring in more than 5% of patients. Grade 3 hand-foot syndrome was 4.4%. CONCLUSION: The all-oral combination of metronomic CTX plus capecitabine is an effective and convenient and well-tolerated regimen for MBC. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00589901).",1
"Phase I and pharmacokinetic study of nab-paclitaxel, nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel, administered weekly to Japanese patients with solid tumors and metastatic breast cancer.","PURPOSE: We conducted phase I and tolerability studies to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose of nab-paclitaxel when administered weekly with solid tumors and to evaluate the tolerability of weekly administration at a dose of 150 mg/m(2) with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) as a first-line therapy in Japanese patients. METHODS: In this phase I study, patients with advanced solid tumors received nab-paclitaxel at dose levels of 80-125 mg/m(2) as 30-min infusions once a week for three weekly doses repeated every 4 weeks. In the tolerability study, patients received 150 mg/m(2) nab-paclitaxel. Blood samples at the first dose of nab-paclitaxel were collected for pharmacokinetic analysis. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were treated for a median of five cycles in the phase I study. The MTD was 125 mg/m(2); the dose-limiting toxicity was neutropenia requiring skipping of the second or third weekly administration in the first cycle. In the tolerability study, six patients were treated for a median of six cycles; no intolerable toxicities were observed in the first cycle. Grade 3 sensory and motor neuropathy was observed in four and one patients, respectively. Ocular toxicities were observed in two patients (keratopathy and macular hole). Maximum paclitaxel concentration and area under the curve increased linearly with the dose. CONCLUSIONS: Weekly administration of nab-paclitaxel was well tolerated up to 100 mg/m(2) by heavily pretreated patients. For MBC patients, 150 mg/m(2) nab-paclitaxel as a first-line therapy was well tolerated. Dose reduction due to neuropathy allows multiple cycles of treatment.",1
Intravenous or oral vinorelbine plus capecitabine as first-line treatment in HER2- metastatic breast cancer: joint analysis of 2 consecutive prospective phase II trials.,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the activity and safety of the combination of vinorelbine (VNR) and capecitabine (CAP) as first-line treatment in HER2-negative (HER(-)) metastatic breast cancer (MBC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (42) enrolled in trial A received intravenous (i.v.) VNR 25 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle combined with CAP 1000 mg/m2 twice daily for 14 consecutive days followed by 1 week of rest. Trial B (46 patients) followed trial A when the oral formulation of VNR became available at our institution. Patients received oral VNR (60 mg/m(2) on days 1-8) combined with the same CAP schedule as in trial A. RESULTS: The response rate (RR) in trial A was 73.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 56.4-82.8), including 12.2% complete responses (CRs). Clinical benefit was achieved in 78% of patients (95% CI, 63.2-87.9). In trial B, overall RR was 76% (95% CI, 62.0-86.0), with 13% CRs and clinical benefit of 80.4% (95% CI, 66.8-89.3). In trial A, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 8.2 months (range, 6-14+ months) and median overall survival (OS) was 32.4 months (range, 17-36+ months). In trial B, median PFS and OS were 8.8 months (range, 8-21+ months) and 34.3 months (14-39+ months), respectively. Treatment-related toxicity was manageable. Quality of life assessment showed a statistically significant difference regarding body image (p = .001), sexual functioning (p = .02), and future perspectives (p = .03) in women receiving chemotherapy fully by the oral route. CONCLUSION: This joint analysis shows that both tested schedules can produce high objective RRs with encouraging PFS, manageable toxicity profile, and suggested benefit on some aspects of quality of life for the fully oral combination.",0
Meta-analysis of phase III trials of docetaxel alone or in combination with chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: Whether combination chemotherapy offers an advantage over sequential therapy in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is still an unsettled issue. Polychemotherapy regimens containing taxanes has been shown to increase overall survival (OS), time to tumor progression (TTP), and overall response rate (ORR) when compared with regimens that did not contain a taxanes, while taxane-based doublets have a statistically significant benefit over single-agent taxane only for progression-free survival. However, the term ""taxanes"" generally includes both paclitaxel and docetaxel, drugs with different clinical activity. Aim of this work is to compare OS, TTP, and ORR in patients with MBC receiving docetaxel alone or in combination with chemotherapy using a formal meta-analysis. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of all published trials comparing docetaxel alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in MBC. RESULTS: Three randomized clinical trials including 1,313 patients were retrieved. A significant reduction of risk ratio was found in TTP (P ≤ 0.0001) but not in OS (P = 0.48) or ORR (P = 0.10) for patients treated with a chemotherapy agent plus docetaxel compared with docetaxel alone. Treatment with docetaxel alone is associated with a lower incidence of grade 3 diarrhea and stomatitis (diarrhea, P = 0.011; stomatitis, P = 0.0004). CONCLUSION: Combination chemotherapy regimens with docetaxel show a statistically significant advantage for TTP, but not for OS and ORR in MBC. This review confirms that it is unlikely that any single agent or combination chemotherapy regimen will emerge as superior in MBC, due to its heterogeneous nature.",0
Phase II trial of temsirolimus in patients with metastatic breast cancer.,"Preclinical models suggested that activating mutations of the PIK3CA gene are associated with sensitivity to inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). In breast cancers, PIK3CA mutations are associated with estrogen receptor (ER) positivity. We therefore performed an open-label single arm phase II study of the rapamycin analog, temsirolimus, at a dose of 25 mg weekly, in women with pretreated breast cancers that were positive for ER, PR, or HER2. Archived formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumor was collected for immunohistochemical evaluation of components of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and PIK3CA mutation analysis. Thirty-one patients were enrolled. There were no major objective responses; however, three patients had stable disease for over 24 weeks. Twenty-three tumor samples were available for mutational analysis. There were five tumors with PIK3CA mutations; no association was found between prolonged stable disease and PIK3CA mutation or any immunohistochemical marker. There was a trend toward improved progression free survival (PFS) for patients with positive nuclear staining for phospho-Akt308. One patient remains on study four and a half years after starting therapy; her tumor did not have a PIK3CA mutation. We conclude that single agent temsirolimus has minimal activity in a population of women with heavily pretreated breast cancer. We found no evidence that either absence of immunohistochemical staining for PTEN or mutations in the hotspot domains of PIK3CA in the primary tumor were associated with clinical benefit.",1
A GINECO randomized phase II trial of two capecitabine and weekly paclitaxel schedules in metastatic breast cancer.,"To determine whether capecitabine schedule adaptation improves the tolerability of capecitabine-paclitaxel combination therapy for metastatic breast cancer (MBC), patients with anthracycline-pretreated HER2-negative MBC were randomized to either arm A (21-day cycles: capecitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) twice daily, days 1-14; paclitaxel 60 mg/m(2), days 1, 8, and 15) or arm B (28-day cycles: capecitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) twice daily, days 1-5, 8-12, and 15-19; paclitaxel 80 mg/m(2), days 1, 8, and 15). The primary endpoint was the incidence of dose reductions or delays >1 week for grade 3/4 toxicity. Secondary endpoints were efficacy and safety. All 130 randomized patients were evaluable for safety. Dose reduction or delay for grade 3/4 toxicity occurred in 39% of patients in arm A and 34% in arm B during cycles 1-6. In arm A, there were significantly more toxicity-related dose reductions (cycles 1-6: 82 vs. 67%, respectively; P = 0.05) and discontinuations (29 vs. 8%, respectively). Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 12 and 0%, respectively, and grade 3 hand-foot syndrome in 12 versus 9%, respectively (grade 4 not applicable). There were no detectable differences in efficacy. Weekday capecitabine dosing with weekly paclitaxel may improve tolerability without a detrimental effect on efficacy, and merits further evaluation in patients suited to combination chemotherapy.",1
Phase II trial of a novel capecitabine dosing schedule in combination with lapatinib for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.,"Our group applied mathematical modeling to capecitabine dosing and predicted 7 days of treatment followed by 7 days of rest (7-7) would improve efficacy and minimize toxicity. The conventional schedule of capecitabine limits full dosing in combination with other agents due to toxicity. Lapatinib inhibits the tyrosine kinase of HER2 and has activity when added to conventionally scheduled capecitabine for the treatment of patients with trastuzumab-refractory, HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer (MBC). We performed this study to evaluate the activity and tolerability of capecitabine 7-7 with lapatinib in patients with trastuzumab-refractory MBC. Eligible patients had measurable, HER2-positive, MBC that progressed following exposure to trastuzumab. Treatment consisted of capecitabine 2,000 mg orally twice daily, 7-7 and lapatinib 1,250 mg orally daily. The primary endpoint was response rate. Secondary endpoints included toxicity, progression-free survival, and stable disease ≥ 6 months. Twenty-three patients were treated on study. More than 60% had prior chemotherapy for MBC and all had prior trastuzumab. After a median of 23 weeks (range 2-96+), five patients had partial responses (23; 95 CI, 7-44%) and six (27; 95 CI, 10-48%) had stable disease ≥ 6 months. Median progression-free survival was 9.4 months. The most common treatment-related toxicities ≥ grade (gr) 2 were hand-foot syndrome (gr 2 43%; gr 3 4% gr 4 0%), diarrhea (gr 2 26%; gr 3/4 0%), elevated liver chemistries (gr 2 17%; gr 3/4 0%), and anemia (gr 2 13%; gr 3 4%; gr 4 4%). No grade ≥ 3 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea events occurred. This study demonstrated feasibility and after meeting biostatistical requirements for continued accrual was terminated in anticipation of slow enrollment. Capecitabine 7-7 with lapatinib was well tolerated with minimal gastrointestinal toxicity. Antitumor activity was observed in patients with trastuzumab-refractory MBC.",1
"Exemestane versus anastrozole as front-line endocrine therapy in postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive, advanced breast cancer: final results from the Spanish Breast Cancer Group 2001-03 phase 2 randomized trial.","BACKGROUND: Several aromatase inhibitor studies have reported variations in the inhibitory potency of these agents that could lead to differences in clinical outcomes. In the current study, the authors formally evaluated the activity of anastrozole and exemestane in postmenopausal women with hormone-responsive, advanced breast cancer. METHODS: Postmenopausal women who had measurable disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors and had not received previous endocrine therapy for advanced breast cancer were randomized to receive either oral exemestane 25 mg daily or oral anastrozole 1 mg daily until they had disease progression. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR), and secondary endpoints included the clinical benefit rate (CBR), time to progression (TTP), overall survival, and safety. Crossover to the other aromatase inhibitor was permitted at the time of disease progression; ORR, CBR, and TTP after second-line treatment also were explored. RESULTS: In total, 103 patients were enrolled. The median patient age was 71.6 years, 52.4% of patients had visceral disease, and 75.8% of patients had ≥ 2 disease sites. Half of the patients had received previous tamoxifen, and 60% had received previous chemotherapy. The efficacy observed in the exemestane and anastrozole groups was an ORR of 36.2% and 46%, respectively; a CBR of 59.6% and 68%, respectively, and a TTP of 6.1 months and 12.1 months, respectively. At progression, 28 patients crossed over to the other aromatase inhibitor, including 16 patients who switched to exemestane (CBR, 43.7%; TTP, 4.4 months) and 12 patients who switched to anastrozole (CBR, 8.3%; TTP, 2 months). Both drugs were generally well tolerated, and no study drug-related serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: In this phase 2 randomized trial, no significant differences in clinical activity were observed in favor of exemestane to justify a superiority phase 3 trial design in the first-line setting.",1
A phase I trial of oral metronomic vinorelbine plus capecitabine in patients with metastatic breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: To determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) of oral metronomic vinorelbine with capecitabine in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Escalated doses of oral metronomic vinorelbine (starting dose 30 mg) every other day continuously and capecitabine (starting dose 800 mg/m(2) bid) on days 1-14 every 21 days were administered. DLTs were evaluated during the first cycle. RESULTS: Thirty-six women were enrolled at eight escalating dose levels. For twenty-four patients, treatment was first line, for eight second line, and for four third line. The DLT level was reached at oral metronomic vinorelbine 70 mg and capecitabine 1,250 mg/m(2), and the recommended MTD doses are vinorelbine 60 mg and capecitabine 1,250 mg/m(2). DLTs were febrile neutropenia grade 3 and 4, diarrhea grade 4, and treatment delays due to unresolved neutropenia. There was no treatment-related death. The main toxicities were grade 2-3 neutropenia in 16.6% of patients each, grade 2-3 anemia 16.5%, grade 2-4 fatigue 27.5%, grade 2-3 nausea/vomiting 11%, and grade 3-4 diarrhea 8.2%. Two complete and 10 partial responses were documented. CONCLUSION: Oral metronomic vinorelbine with capecitabine is a well-tolerated and feasible regimen that merits further evaluation in MBC.",1
"Safety and Efficacy of Tien-Hsien Liquid Practical in Patients with Refractory Metastatic Breast Cancer: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group, Phase IIa Trial.","To evaluate the safety and efficacy of Tien-Hsien Liquid Practical (THL-P), a Chinese herbal mixture, in patients with refractory metastatic breast cancer, we performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase IIa pilot trial. Patients were randomly assigned to either receive THL-P or matching placebo and followed up every 4 weeks for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was changes in the global health status/quality of life (GHS/QOL) scale. The secondary endpoints were changes in functional and symptom scales, immunomodulating effects, and adverse events. Sixty-three patients were enrolled between June 2009 and June 2011. The intent-to-treat population included 28 patients in the THL-P group and 11 patients in the placebo group. Compared to the placebo group, the THL-P group had significant improvement from baseline to last visit in GHS/QOL (41.7 versus -33.3; P < 0.05), CD3, CD4/CD8, CD19, CD16+56 positive cells (P < 0.05), and higher levels of physical, role, emotional, and cognitive functioning, as well as decreased fatigue and systemic side effects. Treatment-related adverse events were mild constipation and localized itching, and no serious adverse events were reported. THL-P appears to be a safe alternative adjuvant treatment for patients with refractory metastatic breast cancer, as it effectively improves QOL and palliates cancer-related symptoms.",0
Preperation of (99m)Tc labeled 5-fluorouracil as a potential diagnostic agent in advanced breast cancer: first clinical trial.,"The chemotherapeutic drug 5-fluorouracil (5FU) is used for treatment of various types of cancers. The present study was conducted to evaluate the potential of this drug as a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical in advanced breast cancer. We have labeled 5FU by using the stannous chloride reduction method with 555MBq of technetium-99m ((99m)Tc). The (99m)Tc-5FU was injected intravenously in 4 patients having advanced breast cancer. Dynamic and static images were taken at various time intervals till 2h. Whole body images were used to calculate the percentage of the injected dose, in each organ. Target to non target ratio was calculated to find out the optimum time for imaging. In conclusion, our study showed that (99m)Tc-5FU was a promising agent for diagnosing advanced breast cancer with optimum visualization at 1h.",0
A phase 2 study of the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with anthracyclines with/without taxanes.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Many patients with relapsed metastatic breast cancer are pre-treated with taxanes and anthracyclines, which are usually given in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting or as first-line treatment for metastatic disease. The primary objective of this study was to determine the overall response rate for combination treatment with gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who had relapsed after receiving one adjuvant/neoadjuvant or first-line metastatic chemotherapy regimen containing an anthracycline with/without a taxane. Secondary endpoints included duration of response, time to progression, one-year survival probability, and toxicity. DESIGN AND SETTING: A single-arm, open-label, phase 2 study conducted at 17 investigative sites in Egypt. PATIENTS AND METHODS: treatment consisted of gemcitabine (1250 mg/m2) on Days 1 and 8 and cisplatin (70 mg/m2) on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Treatment continued until disease progression or a maximum of 6 cycles. RESULTS: Of 144 patients all were evaluable for safety and 132 patients were evaluable for efficacy. The overall response rate was 33.3% and 45.5% of the patients with stable disease as their best response. The median time-to-progression was 5.1 months and the one-year survival probability was 73%. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were nausea/vomiting (20.1%), neutropenia (19.4%), anemia (13.9%), asthenia (11.1%), diarrhea (9.7%), stomatitis (7.6%), leucopenia (7.6%), and thrombocytopenia (6.2%). twelve (8.3%) patients had serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that gemcitabine and cisplatin were active and generally well tolerated in pretreated patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.",1
Gefitinib in Combination with Weekly Docetaxel in Patients with Metastatic Breast Cancer Caused Unexpected Toxicity: Results from a Randomized Phase II Clinical Trial.,"In patients with metastatic breast cancer, taxane treatment demonstrates activity but is not curative. Targeted treatment modalities are therefore necessary in order to improve outcomes in this group. A randomized placebo-controlled phase II trial was initiated to evaluate effect and toxicity of gefitinib (250 mg QD) and docetaxel 35 mg/m(2) (six of seven weeks) (NCT 00319618). The inclusion of 66 patients was planned. The study was closed due to treatment-related toxicity. Of the 18 included patients, seven (of which three received gefitinib) were withdrawn from the study due to toxicity. Of the nine patients receiving gefitinib and chemotherapy, one achieved a partial response and four stable disease. In the chemotherapy of nine patients, four had a partial response and four stable disease. The breast cancer patients in this study were genotyped using a panel of 14 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), previously found associated with docetaxel clearance in a cohort of lung cancer patients. We were unable to identify genes related to toxicity in this study. Nevertheless, toxicity was aggravated by the addition of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor. In conclusion, despite adequately tolerated as monotherapy, combination regimens should be carefully considered for overlapping adverse events in order to avoid increased treatment-related toxicity.",1
"A Phase II Study of Concurrent Docetaxel, Epirubicin and Cyclophosphamide as a Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Regimen in Patients with Locally Advanced Breast Cancer.","Background: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with concurrent docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide is commonly used for patients with locally advanced breast cancer. Epirubicin is another anthracycline used in breast cancer but the concurrent use of epirubicin and taxane is not well-established. We conducted a single institution, phase II study to assess the efficacy and safety of concurrent docetaxel, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (TEC) as a neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen in breast cancer. Methods: Patients with newly diagnosed locally advanced breast cancer defined as T2 >3 cm, T3, T4 with any N, or any T with N1-3 were eligible. A chemotherapy regimen of docetaxel 75mg/m(2), epirubicin 75mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 600mg/m(2 )was given with filgrastim support every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. The primary end-point was pathologic complete response rate. Results: Twenty patients were enrolled from 2003 to 2006. The median age was 51 (29-70) year-old. Eight patients were premenopausal. Ten patients had positive hormone receptors. Four patients had HER2 positive receptor. Nineteen patients completed six cycles of TEC chemotherapy. The pathologic complete response rate was 25%. Eight of sixteen patients with N1-3 disease had pathological negative lymph nodes. With a median follow up of 57.5 (16-71) months, four patients relapsed including one death from recurrence. The estimated 5 year relapse-free survival was 79.3% and the 5-year overall survival was 94.7%. No patient had cardiac failure or death during treatment. The most common grade 3-4 toxicity was neutropenia (35%). Conclusion: TEC regimen is a well- tolerated and effective neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen for locally advanced breast cancer that results in a pathologic complete response rate of 25%.",1
High-dose toremifene as first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer resistant to adjuvant aromatase inhibitor: A multicenter phase II study.,"There is currently no standardized therapy available for metastatic breast cancer in patients with aromatase inhibitor (AI)-resistant breast cancer. We conducted a prospective study to examine the efficacy and safety of high-dose toremifene (TOR) treatment for the first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer following AI adjuvant therapy. A multicenter phase II study was designed (Registry no.: UMIN000000489). Inclusion criteria comprised hormone-responsive postmenopausal women who had received adjuvant AI postoperatively for >1 year and had relapsed during the treatment or within 12 months of completion of adjuvant therapy. Treatment comprised oral intake of 120 mg TOR once a day. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). The secondary endpoints were evaluations of clinical benefit (CB), progression-free survival (PFS) and toxicity. A total of 13 patients were enrolled. ORR was 7.7% (1/13) [95% CI, 0.2-36.0%]. In total, 7 patients (53.8%) had stable disease (SD), 5 of whom were long SD, and 5 patients (38.5%) experienced progressive disease (PD). The CB rate was 46.2% (6/13) [95% CI, 19.2-74.9%]. The median time to PFS was 5.9 months. No serious adverse events were observed. Patients with HER2-positive disease exhibited marginally poorer PFS (p=0.08). Patients with PD had a relatively short duration of AI treatment in contrast to responders, who had a longer period of AI treatment (p=0.02). High-dose TOR as a first-line treatment following AI adjuvant therapy was effective and well tolerated. A longer duration of adjuvant AI therapy and negative HER2 overexpression may, with further studies, be beneficial as positive predictive factors for the effectiveness of TOR treatment.",1
Phase II study of bevacizumab in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine as first-line treatment for HER-2-positive locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer.,"We report the first results from a phase II, open-label study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine as first-line therapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2-positive locally recurrent (LR) or metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Patients were aged ≥18 years with confirmed breast adenocarcinoma, measurable LR/MBC and documented HER-2-positive disease. Patients received bevacizumab (15 mg/kg on day 1) plus trastuzumab (8 mg/kg on day 1 of cycle 1, 6 mg/kg on day 1 of each subsequent cycle) plus capecitabine (1,000 mg/m2 twice daily, days 1-14) every 3 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or consent withdrawal. Eighty-eight patients were enrolled; 40 (46%) are still on study treatment. The median follow-up was 8.8 months (range, 0.9-17.1 months). The overall response rate, the primary endpoint, was 73% (95% confidence interval [CI], 62%-82%), comprising 7% complete and 66% partial responses. The median progression-free survival interval was 14.4 months (95% CI, 10.4 months to not reached [NR]), with 35 events. The median time to progression was 14.5 months (95% CI, 10.5 months to NR), with 33 events. Treatment was well tolerated; main side effects were grade 3 hand-foot syndrome (22%), grade ≥3 diarrhea (9%), and grade ≥3 hypertension (7%). Overall, 44% of patients experienced grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events and 13 patients discontinued capecitabine because of toxicity, but continued with bevacizumab and trastuzumab. Heart failure was seen in two patients. The combination of bevacizumab, trastuzumab, and capecitabine was clinically active as first-line therapy for patients with HER-2-positive MBC, with an acceptable safety profile and no unexpected toxicities.",1
Phase II trial of simple oral therapy with capecitabine and cyclophosphamide in patients with metastatic breast cancer: SWOG S0430.,"BACKGROUND: Interest in oral agents for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) has increased because many patients prefer oral to i.v. regimens. We evaluated a simple oral combination of capecitabine with cyclophosphamide (CPA) for MBC. METHODS: The trial was designed to determine whether or not combination therapy would achieve a 42% response rate (RR) using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) in MBC. Patients with two or fewer prior chemotherapy regimens for MBC were eligible. Those with estrogen receptor-positive MBC had to have progressed on endocrine therapy. Patients had measurable disease or elevated mucin (MUC)-1 antigen and received CPA, 100 mg daily on days 1-14, and capecitabine, 1,500 mg twice daily on days 8-21, in 21-day cycles. RESULTS: In 96 eligible patients, the median progression-free survival (PFS) interval was 5.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.7-8.0 months) and median overall survival (OS) time was 18.8 months (95% CI, 13.1-22.0 months). The RR was 36% (95% CI, 26%-48%) in 80 patients with measurable disease. The MUC-1 antigen RR was 33% (95% CI, 20%-48%), occurring in 15 of 46 patients with elevated MUC-1 antigen. Toxicity was mild, with no treatment-related deaths. CONCLUSIONS: PFS, OS, and RR outcomes with capecitabine plus CPA compare favorably with those of capecitabine monotherapy and combination therapy with bevacizumab, sorafenib, or ixabepilone. The addition of these other agents to capecitabine does not improve OS time in MBC patients, and this single-arm study does not suggest that the addition of CPA to capecitabine has this potential in an unselected MBC population. When OS prolongation is the goal, clinicians should choose single-agent capecitabine.",1
Randomised trial of expressive writing for distressed metastatic breast cancer patients.,"Women with metastatic breast cancer and significant psychological distress (N = 87) were assigned randomly to engage in four home-based sessions of expressive writing or neutral writing. Women in the expressive writing group wrote about their deepest thoughts and feelings regarding their cancer, whereas women in the neutral writing group wrote about their daily activities in a factual manner. No statistically significant group differences in existential and psychological well-being, fatigue and sleep quality were found at 8-weeks post-writing. However, the expressive writing group reported significantly greater use of mental health services during the study than the neutral writing group (55% vs. 26%, respectively; p < 0.05). Findings suggest that expressive writing may improve the uptake of mental health services among distressed cancer patients, but is not broadly effective as a psychotherapeutic intervention.",0
A phase I study of dasatinib and weekly paclitaxel for metastatic breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: SRC plays an important role in the pathogenesis of metastatic breast cancer (MBC). In preclinical models, paclitaxel and the oral SRC inhibitor dasatinib showed greater antitumor activity than either agent. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of this combination, we conducted a phase I study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with MBC; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of zero to one; normal hepatic, renal and marrow function were eligible. Paclitaxel 80 mg/m(2) was given 3 weeks of 4. The starting dasatinib dose was 70 mg and was increased, using a standard 3 + 3 dose-escalation scheme. RESULTS: Fifteen patients enrolled (median age 54 years, range 35-74). No dose-limiting toxic effects (DLTs) occurred at dasatinib doses of 70-120 mg. One DLT (grade 3 fatigue) occurred in the dasatinib 150-mg cohort, which was expanded (six patients) with no further DLTs. However, due to cumulative toxic effects (rash, fatigue, diarrhea), the recommended phase II dose is dasatinib 120 mg. Of 13 assessable patients, a partial response was seen in 4 patients (31%), including 2 patients previously treated with taxanes; all received ≥120 mg dasatinib. An additional five patients (29%) had stable disease. CONCLUSION: In combination with weekly paclitaxel, the recommended phase II dose of dasatinib is 120 mg daily and preliminary activity has been seen in patients with MBC.",1
Multicenter Phase II Study with Weekly Bendamustine and Paclitaxel as First- or Later-Line Therapy in Patients with Metastatic Breast Cancer: RiTa II Trial.,"The combination of bendamustine (B) and paclitaxel (P) as anthracycline-free treatment option in patients with advanced breast cancer has been evaluated in the previous RiTa I trial. The regimen of weekly B 70 mg/m(2) and P 90 mg/m(2) with a pause every 4th week was established as an effective regimen with low toxicity. The aim of the present RiTa II study was to investigate the potential of BP as anthracycline-free combination therapy. The primary objective was to determine the progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints were safety, tolerability, overall response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS). 26 patients were available, 15 received BP as first-line, 11 as beyond first-line treatment. 27% patients had triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Median PFS and OS were 7.3 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 5.5-10.9) and 14.9 months (95% CI: 9.9-22.9), respectively. The 1-year PFS rate was 20.3% and the 1-year OS rate 71.2%. The ORR was 42.3%, including 4 complete and 7 partial remissions. TNBC patients reached an ORR of 71.4%. Anthracycline-pretreated patients showed an ORR of 43.8%, confirming bendamustine's lack of cross-resistance to anthracycline agents. BP represents a favorable option with moderate toxicity in pretreated metastatic breast cancer and offers a possibility for application in anthracycline-pretreated and TNBC patients.",1
A phase II study of lipoplatin (liposomal cisplatin)/vinorelbine combination in HER-2/neu-negative metastatic breast cancer.,"We assessed the efficacy and safety of a liposomal cisplatin (lipoplatin) and vinorelbine combination in metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Thirty-five patients were treated. The objective response rate was 53.1% and the median survival time was 22 months. Grade 3/4 neutropenia was observed in 44% of cycles, and febrile neutropenia was seen in 4 patients (11.4%). No grade 3/4 nephrotoxicity or neuropathy was noted. This combination is effective and well tolerated in patients with MBC and it warrants investigation as first-line treatment.BACKGROUND: Liposomal cisplatin (lipoplatin) has a mechanism of action similar to that of cisplatin, with reduced toxicities and enhanced or similar efficacy. We wanted to assess the efficacy and safety of a lipoplatin/vinorelbine combination in a phase II clinical trial in metastatic breast cancer (MBC). METHODS: Thirty-five patients with HER-2/neu-negative (HER-2/neu(-)) MBC were enrolled. Lipoplatin 120 mg/m(2) (days 1, 8, and 15) and vinorelbine 30 mg/m(2) (days 1 and 8) were administered in a 21-day cycle. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis; 32 patients were evaluable for response. The objective response rate was 53.1%. Complete response (CR) was achieved in 3 patients (9.4%), partial response (PR) was seen in 14 patients (43.8%), stable disease (SD) was obtained in 12 patients (37.5%), and progressive disease (PD) was seen in 3 patients (9.4%). Median time to disease progression was 8 months (range 6-10 months). After a median follow-up of 15.5 months, 18 patients were still alive; the median survival time was 22 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 14-30). A total of 174 cycles were administered. Neutropenia was the most frequent hematologic toxicity, with grade 3/4 neutropenia observed in 44% of cycles. Febrile neutropenia was observed in 4 patients (11.4%). No grade 3/4 nephrotoxicity or neuropathy was noted. Grade 1/2 nephrotoxicity occurred in 8 patients (22.9%) and grade 3 vomiting was seen in 3 patients (8.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this trial reveal that vinorelbine/lipoplatin is effective in treating patients with MBC. This regimen is well tolerated with no grade 3/4 nephrotoxicity or neuropathy. The investigation of this regimen as first-line treatment in MBC is warranted.",1
A pilot phase II trial of all-trans retinoic acid (Vesanoid) and paclitaxel (Taxol) in patients with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: We investigated a combination therapy with weekly paclitaxel and all trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) for tolerability, response to treatment, time to progression and survival in previously treated patients with metastatic or recurrent breast cancer. Our rationale was based on preclinical studies demonstrating potentiation of the cytotoxic effects of taxanes and induction of differentiation by ATRA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients with previously treated metastatic or recurrent breast cancer were enrolled to a regimen of all-trans retinoic acid (Vesanoid, tretinoin, Hoffman-La Roche, Inc.) 45 mg/m(2) PO daily for 4 days starting 2 days before a 1 h treatment with paclitaxel (Taxol, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Plainsboro, NJ) 80 mg/m(2) IV administered weekly for 3 weeks, repeated in 28 day cycles until disease progression or until no longer tolerated. Patients were evaluated for toxicity, response, time to progression and survival. Patients were primarily African American and Latino, representative of the population served by our Cancer Center. RESULTS: The regimen was relatively well tolerated. There were nine grade 3 and one grade 4 toxic events. We administered 162 treatment cycles with a mean of 7.5 per patient (range 1-22, median 5). Three patients had a partial response (17.6%) and ten patients had stable disease (58.8%), with an overall clinical benefit of 76.4%. Median time to progression was 6.0 months (range 1-21, mean 7.7 months). Fourteen evaluable patients had a median survival of 16 months (range 1-68 months, mean 25.2 months). CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest this is a well tolerated regimen with modest response rates but with time to progression and survival rates similar to those reported for paclitaxel alone and relatively high rates of stable disease in this sample of patients.",1
A phase II randomized study comparing navelbine and capecitabine (Navcap) followed either by Navcap or by weekly docetaxel in the first-line treatment of HER-2/neu negative metastatic breast cancer.,"Following the proven efficacy and tolerability of Navcap and Navcap followed by docetaxel in the treatment of MBC, a phase II randomized study was initiated to assess the ORR of both arms in the first-line setting of MBC. Patients with no prior chemotherapy for MBC and HER-2/neu negative were eligible. All patients received Navcap (V 25 mg/m2 on d1 and d8 and C 825 mg/m2 bid D1-14 q3w) for a total of 4 cycles. Patients progressing under Navcap were withdrawn and received docetaxel as second-line treatment. Patients responding or stable were randomized to 2 arms: 4 cycles of Navcap (A) or 12 weekly docetaxel (25 mg/m²/week) (B). From July 2004 to July 2008, a total of 106 patients were enrolled. Ninety-four patients were evaluable before randomization, with a clinical benefit of 58%. Twenty-one patients (22%) had disease progression and were therefore not randomized. Forty-one patients were randomized to arm A and 29 patients to arm B. ORRs were 56 and 71% in arms A and B, respectively. The median time to progression and overall survival were 10 and 35 months in arm A and 12 and 37 months in arm B. Adverse events were mild. Arm A: grade 3-4 neutropenia (10%), grade 3 anemia (5%). Arm B: grade 3 neutropenia (6%), grade 3 anemia (6.2%), and grade 2 alopecia (12%). Conclusion: Both Navcap and Navcap followed by Docetaxel regimens were tolerated with manageable toxicity, offering consistent activities in terms of response rate for metastatic breast cancer patients.",1
Phase II study of bi-weekly irinotecan for patients with previously treated HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer: KMBOG0610B.,"BACKGROUND: A trial was conducted to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of biweekly administration of irinotecan, a novel topoisomerase I inhibitor, for patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) previously treated with either anthracycline-based or taxane-based chemotherapy. METHODS: Eligible patients were HER2-negative, had a performance status of 0 to 2, and had been treated previously with either anthracyclines or taxanes for MBC. Patients received irinotecan intravenously at 150 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 15 every 4 weeks. The primary end-point was feasibility, and the treatment was considered feasible if a patient was able to receive three administrations of irinotecan within the first 8 weeks, as pre-specified in the protocol. RESULTS: Eighteen patients (median age 60 years) were enrolled. Fifteen patients received irinotecan more than 3 times within the first 8 weeks, with resulting feasibility of 83.3%. The median number of treatment cycles was 2 (range 1-16) during this period, and the relative dose intensity was 91.2%. Partial response was observed for one patient, so overall response rate was 5.6%. Nine patients (50.0%) had stable disease, and overall disease control was 50.0%. Median progression-free survival and overall survival periods were 3.2 and 9.6 months, respectively. The only grade 3/4 hematological toxicity was neutropenia (22.2%). Grade 3/4 non-hematological toxicities were anorexia (11.2%), diarrhea (11.2%), and fatigue (5.6%). No treatment-related death occurred. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that biweekly administration of 150 mg/m(2) irinotecan was feasible for patients with MBC treated previously with anthracyclines or taxanes.",1
A phase 2 trial of dasatinib in patients with advanced HER2-positive and/or hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: SRC-family kinases (SFK) are involved in numerous oncogenic signaling pathways. A phase 2 trial of dasatinib, a potent oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor of SFKs, was carried out in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) and/or hormone receptor-positive (HR+) advanced breast cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with measurable tumors and progression after chemotherapy and HER2 and/or HR-targeted agents in adjuvant or metastatic settings (maximum of two prior metastatic setting regimens) received twice daily dasatinib. Primary endpoint was Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors-defined response rate. Secondary endpoints included toxicity and limited pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: Seventy patients (55 years median age) were treated, 83% of HER2+ patients had received prior HER2-directed therapy, and 61% of HR+ patients had received prior endocrine therapy in the advanced setting. Dasatinib starting dose was reduced from 100 to 70 mg twice daily to limit toxicity. Median therapy duration was 1.8 months in both dose groups and most discontinuations were due to progression. Of 69 evaluable patients, three had confirmed partial responses and six had stable disease for 16 weeks or more (disease control rate = 13.0%); all nine of these tumors were HR+ (two were also HER2+). The most common drug-related toxicities were gastrointestinal complaints, headache, asthenia, and pleural effusion. Grade 3-4 toxicity occurred in 37% of patients and was comparable between doses; drug-related serious adverse events were less frequent with 70 mg twice daily than 100 mg twice daily. CONCLUSION: Limited single-agent activity was observed with dasatinib in patients with advanced HR+ breast cancer.",1
Myotax: a phase II trial of docetaxel plus non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin as first-line therapy of metastatic breast cancer previously treated with adjuvant anthracyclines.,"AIM: Non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (NPLD) has demonstrated equivalent antitumour activity to conventional doxorubicin and a significantly lower risk of cardiotoxicity when given as a single agent or in combination with cyclophosphamide. This phase II trial was performed to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of NPLD and docetaxel combination in patients with metastatic breast cancer previously exposed to adjuvant anthracyclines. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients received NPLD 60 mg/m(2) and docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) in a 21-day cycle as first-line therapy of metastatic breast cancer. Treatment was planned for six cycles and was continued until progression or toxicity. RESULTS: Objective response rate among response-assessable patients was 79% (95% CI (confidence interval), 64-94%) and 27% (95% CI, 11-43%) presented a complete response. Median progression free survival was 11.3 months (95% CI, 6.2-13.3 months) and median overall survival was 28.2 months (95% CI, 16-36.4 months). Symptomatic grade 3 cardiotoxicity occurred in 15% of cases and febrile neutropenia in 47% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of NPLD and docetaxel demonstrated high antitumour activity in a population of metastatic breast cancer patients exposed to adjuvant anthracyclines and showed an unexpected and unexplained 15% symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction rate.",1
Bi-weekly docetaxel and gemcitabine regimen in her-2-negative and anthracycline-pretreated metastatic breast cancer patients: a multicenter phase II trial.,"PURPOSE: Bi-weekly gemcitabine (G) in combination with docetaxel (D) is an effective treatment for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) previously treated with adjuvant/neoadjuvant anthracyclines containing regimens with a good toxicity profile. In the present phase II study, we investigated the activity of the same regimen as first-line treatment. METHODS: Women with breast cancer pretreated in adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting with anthracyclines received bi-weekly G (1,250 mg/m² days 1, 15) and D (50 mg/m² days 1, 15) every 28 days with restaging after 3 and 6 cycles. RESULTS: Overall 42 patients were enrolled. Median age is 48 years (range, 31-71 years). Eight patients (19%) achieved complete responses, 18 (43%) partial responses for an overall response rate (ORR) of 62%; five patients (12%) obtained stable disease (SD), and 8 (19%) patients had progressive disease (PD). After a median 17-month follow-up, the median time to disease progression was 12 months (95% CI, 3-26 months) and the median survival time was 27 months (95% CI, 4-57 months). No grade 4 toxicity was seen except in one patient who developed a grade 4 neutropenia. Grade 3 toxicities were leukopenia (2%), neutropenia (14%), anemia (2%), nausea and vomiting (2%), diarrhea (2%), asthenia (2%), and skin toxicity (12%). CONCLUSION: The GD bi-weekly regimen is well tolerated and active as first line in anthracyclines-pretreated women with MBC. It appears as an interesting alternative compared to a 3-week schedule whenever hematological toxicity is the main clinical concern.",1
"Phase II trial of saracatinib (AZD0530), an oral SRC-inhibitor for the treatment of patients with hormone receptor-negative metastatic breast cancer.","BACKGROUND: SRC activation is associated with cell migration, proliferation, and metastasis. Saracatinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) selective for SRC. We performed this trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saracatinib monotherapy in patients with estrogen receptor (ER)(-) and progesterone receptor (PR)(-) metastatic breast cancer (MBC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients who had undergone ≤ 1 previous chemotherapy regimen for measurable ER(-) and PR(-) MBC received saracatinib 175 mg orally daily. The primary endpoint was disease control defined as complete response (CR) + partial response (PR) + stable disease (SD) > 6 months. Secondary endpoints included toxicity and progression-free survival (PFS). Levels of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in response to therapy were measured over time. RESULTS: Nine patients were treated on study. After a median of 2 cycles (range 1-3), no patient had achieved CR, PR, or SD >6 months. The median time to treatment failure was 82 days (12-109 days).The majority (89%) of patients discontinued saracatinib because of disease progression. One patient acquired potentially treatment-related grade 4 hypoxia with interstitial infiltrates and was removed from the study. Common adverse events included fatigue, elevated liver enzymes, nausea, hyponatremia, dyspnea, cough, and adrenal insufficiency. CONCLUSIONS: These efficacy results were not sufficiently promising to justify continued accrual to this study. Based on this series, saracatinib does not appear to have significant single-agent activity for the treatment of patients with ER(-)/PR(-) MBC.",1
Phase 2 trial of a novel capecitabine dosing schedule in combination with bevacizumab for patients with metastatic breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Capecitabine has antitumor activity in metastatic breast cancer (MBC); however, its optimal dose and schedule remain unclear. Mathematical modeling predicts that a capecitabine schedule 7 days of treatment followed by 7 days of rest (7-7) will improve efficacy and minimize toxicity. Bevacizumab has demonstrated the ability to improve outcomes when it is added to chemotherapy, including capecitabine, in the first-line and second-line settings. METHODS: Patients with measurable MBC received oral capecitabine (2000 mg twice daily; 7-7), and intravenous bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks). The primary endpoint was the response rate. Secondary endpoints included toxicity, the clinical benefit rate, and progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: Forty-one patients were treated. After a median of 7 cycles (range, 1-32 cycles), partial responses were observed in 20% of patients, and stable disease for ≥6 months was noted in 35% patients. The median PFS was 8 months. The most common treatment-related toxicities were hand-foot syndrome (49% grade 2, 20% grade 3/4) hypertension (12% grade 2, 10% grade 3/4), and fatigue (12% grade 2, 2% grade 3/4). Diarrhea (5% grade 2, 0% grade 3/4), nausea (0% grade 2-4), and vomiting (0% grade 2-4) were rare. CONCLUSIONS: Capecitabine administered for 7 days followed by a 7-day rest in combination with bevacizumab had modest efficacy and an acceptable toxicity profile in patients with MBC. Gastrointestinal toxicity with this schedule was minimal.",1
Single-agent pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer: results of an Austrian observational trial.,"BACKGROUND: In advanced breast cancer, multiple sequential lines of treatments are frequently applied. Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) has a favourable toxicity profile and can be used in first or higher lines of therapy. PLD has demonstrated response activity even after prior anthracycline exposure. METHODS: 129 consecutive patients with advanced breast cancer, of whom the majority had been massively pretreated, received PLD as monotherapy within licensed approval, for which efficacy and toxicities were documented. RESULTS: In a routine therapy setting, PLD was administered in a slightly reduced dose (median, 40 mg/m2 per cycle). Response rate (complete and partial remission) was 26%, and stable disease was observed in 19% of patients. Progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 5.8 months and 14.2 months, respectively. There was no difference in terms of response and PFS, no matter if patients had already received anthracycline treatment. Interestingly, PFS proved similar regardless whether PLD was administered as palliative therapy in first, second or third line. Furthermore, PFS and OS were similar in patients with response or stable disease, underscoring the view that disease stabilization is associated with a profound clinical benefit. The most common side effects reported were palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (17%), exanthema (14%) and mucositis (12%). CONCLUSIONS: Efficacy and toxicity data in these ""real life"" patients permit the conclusion that PLD is a valuable option in the treatment of advanced breast cancer even in heavily pretreated patients.",1
Phase I/II study of trastuzumab in combination with everolimus (RAD001) in patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer who progressed on trastuzumab-based therapy.,"PURPOSE: Trastuzumab resistance has been linked to activation of the phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a dual phosphatase that counteracts the PI3K function; PTEN loss leads to activation of the Akt cascade and the downstream mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Preclinical studies demonstrated that mTOR inhibition sensitized the response to trastuzumab in mice with HER2 overexpressing and PTEN-deficient breast xenografts. Our trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of the combination of everolimus and trastuzumab in women with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer (MBC) that progressed on trastuzumab-based therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This represents a pooled analysis (n = 47), stemming from two trials that occurred concurrently in The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Patients with HER2-overexpressing MBC who had progressed on trastuzumab-based therapy received trastuzumab every 3 weeks in combination with daily everolimus. RESULTS: Among 47 patients, the combination of everolimus and trastuzumab provided partial responses in seven patients (15%) and persistent stable disease (lasting 6 months or longer) in nine patients (19%), resulting in a clinical benefit rate of 34%. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.1 month. Fatigue, infection, and mucositis were the predominant nonhematologic toxicities. Trastuzumab did not have significant influence on the pharmacokinetic profile of everolimus. Patients with PTEN loss demonstrated decreased overall survival (P = .048). However, PFS was not affected by PTEN loss. CONCLUSION: Inhibition of mTOR results in clinical benefit and disease response in patients with trastuzumab-resistant HER2-overexpressing MBC.",1
HSP90 inhibition is effective in breast cancer: a phase II trial of tanespimycin (17-AAG) plus trastuzumab in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer progressing on trastuzumab.,"PURPOSE: HSP90 is a chaperone protein required for the stability of a variety of client proteins. 17-Demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) is a natural product that binds to HSP90 and inhibits its activity, thereby inducing the degradation of these clients. In preclinical studies, HER2 is one of the most sensitive known client proteins of 17-AAG. On the basis of these data and activity in a phase I study, we conducted a phase II study of 17-AAG (tanespimycin) with trastuzumab in advanced trastuzumab-refractory HER2-positive breast cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We enrolled patients with metastatic HER2(+) breast cancer whose disease had previously progressed on trastuzumab. All patients received weekly treatment with tanespimycin at 450 mg/m(2) intravenously and trastuzumab at a conventional dose. Therapy was continued until disease progression. The primary endpoint was response rate by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were enrolled with a median age of 53 years and a median Karnofsky performance status (KPS) of 90%. The most common toxicities, largely grade 1, were diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, and headache. The overall response rate was 22%, the clinical benefit rate [complete response + partial response + stable disease] was 59%, the median progression-free survival was 6 months (95% CI: 4-9), and the median overall survival was 17 months (95% CI: 16-28). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first phase II study to definitively show RECIST-defined responses for 17-AAG in solid tumors. Tanespimycin plus trastuzumab has significant anticancer activity in patients with HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer previously progressing on trastuzumab. Further research exploring this therapeutic interaction and the activity of HSP90 inhibitors is clearly warranted.",1
Hormonal therapy plus bevacizumab in postmenopausal patients who have hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer: a phase II Trial of the Sarah Cannon Oncology Research Consortium.,"PURPOSE: Preclinical models suggest that addition of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy may improve the efficacy of anti-estrogens in hormone-sensitive breast cancer. This phase II trial evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of bevacizumab added to either anastrozole or fulvestrant in the first-line treatment of patients who have hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer. METHODS: Women who had newly diagnosed metastatic hormone receptor-positive breast cancer were eligible. Patients who had relapsed while receiving, or ≤ 12 months after receiving, adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy were treated with bevacizumab (10 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks) and fulvestrant (loading dose 500 mg intramuscularly [IM], then 250 mg IM 2 weeks later, then 250 mg IM every 4 weeks). All other patients received fulvestrant/bevacizumab or anastrozole (1 mg orally daily)/bevacizumab. Patients who were HER2-positive could also receive trastuzumab (8 mg/kg loading dose, then 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks). Patients were reevaluated after 8 weeks of therapy; responding or stable patients continued treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients were enrolled (38 were administered anastrozole 41 fulvestrant). Median treatment duration was 8 months in the anastrozole group and 5.5 months in the fulvestrant group. Both regimens were efficacious: overall response rate and median progression-free survival for the entire group were 28% and 13.5 months, respectively. Both regimens were well-tolerated; toxicity was consistent with the known toxicity profiles of each single agent. CONCLUSION: Bevacizumab combined with either anastrozole or fulvestrant was feasible and active in the first-line treatment of patients who have hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer. Phase III trials evaluating the efficacy of bevacizumab added to endocrine therapy are in progress.",1
Phase II Study of Vinorelbine Plus Trastuzumab in HER2 Overexpressing Metastatic Breast Cancer Pretreated with Anthracyclines and Taxanes.,"PURPOSE: The role of first-line trastuzumab-based therapy has been firmly established in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) positive metastatic breast cancer. In this trial, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of a vinorelbine and trastuzumab combination chemotherapy in patients who were pretreated with anthracyclines and taxanes. METHODS: Thirty-three patients with HER2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancer, all of whom had previously been treated with anthracyclines and taxanes, were included in this study. The patients were treated with 25 mg/m(2) of vinorelbine (over a 15-minute infusion) on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks. Additionally, trastuzumab was administered at an initial dose of 4 mg/kg over 90 minutes, and was subsequently administered at weekly doses of 2 mg/kg (over 30 minutes). RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 53 years (range, 39-72 years). The overall response rate was 30.3% (10 patients; 95% confidence interval [CI], 23-57%). The median time to progression was 6.8 months (95% CI, 5.3-8.2 months). The median overall survival was 12.4 months (95% CI, 10.3-14.6 months). In the 194 cycles of treatment, the incidence rates of grade ≥3 neutropenia and anemia were 7.2% and 1.0%, respectively. Neutropenic fever was detected in three cycles (1.5%). The non-hematological toxicities were not severe: grade 1 or 2 nausea or vomiting was detected in 15.2%, and grade 2 neuropathy was noted in 6.1% of patients. None of the patients experienced any serious cardiac toxicity, and no treatment-related deaths occurred. CONCLUSION: These results show that a combination chemotherapy consisting of vinorelbine and trastuzumab is useful in patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer who were pretreated with anthracyclines and taxanes, with a favorable toxicity profile.",1
A multicentre dose-escalating study of cabazitaxel (XRP6258) in combination with capecitabine in patients with metastatic breast cancer progressing after anthracycline and taxane treatment: a phase I/II study.,"BACKGROUND: Most patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) progress after chemotherapy. Cabazitaxel (XRP6258) is a new taxoid that is active in chemotherapy-resistant tumour cell lines. The objectives of this phase I/II study were to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety profile, pharmacokinetics, and activity of cabazitaxel plus capecitabine in patients with MBC who had been previously treated with taxanes and anthracyclines. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In part I, we used a 3+3 dose-escalation scheme to assess the MTD of intravenous cabazitaxel (day 1) with oral capecitabine twice daily (days 1-14) every 3 weeks. In part II, we evaluated the objective response rate (ORR) at the MTD. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients were enrolled and treated (15 in part I; 18 in part II). Cabazitaxel 20mg/m(2) plus capecitabine 1000 mg/m(2) was the MTD. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed no apparent drug-drug interaction. In all patients, the main grade 3-4 toxicities were asthenia (n=5), hand-foot syndrome (n=5), neutropenia (n=21), neutropenic infection (n=1), and neutropenic colitis (n=1). One patient had febrile neutropenia. Antitumour activity was observed at all dose-levels with two complete responses, five partial responses (PRs), and 20 disease stabilisations (seven unconfirmed PR). At the MTD, 21 patients were evaluable for efficacy. The ORR was 23.8% (95% CI: 8.2-47.2%). The median response duration was 3.1 months (95% CI: 2.1-8.4 months), with four of five lasting for more than 3 months. Median time to progression was 4.9 months. CONCLUSIONS: Cabazitaxel combined with capecitabine is active, has a safety profile consistent with a taxane plus capecitabine combination and warrants further investigation in patients with MBC.",1
Biweekly vinorelbine and tegafur/uracil in patients with metastatic breast cancer previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes: GEICAM 2000-02 phase II study.,"INTRODUCTION: To assess the efficacy and safety profile of biweekly vinorelbine and tegafur/uracil (UFT) as treatment in patients with metastatic breast cancer previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with histologically confirmed breast cancer, measurable disease, no more than one prior chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2, and adequate bone marrow, renal and liver function were eligible. Patients received vinorelbine (30 mg/m(2) on day 1) and UFT (250 mg/m(2) daily) every two weeks for 12 cycles unless progression or unacceptable toxicity was observed. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were included and received 311 cycles of chemotherapy. Efficacy and toxicity analyses were carried out on an intention-to-treat basis. The overall response rate was 35% (95% CI: 20-53). With a median follow-up of 18.6 months (95% CI: 1.0-74.3), the median time to progression was 7.0 months (96% CI: 5.2-8.9) and the median overall survival was 19.4 months (95% CI: 11.1-27.8). The most common severe toxicities were neutropenia (38% of patients) and asthenia (11% of patients). CONCLUSION: The combination of biweekly vinorelbine and UFT in patients with metastatic breast cancer pretreated with anthracyclines and taxanes is a well tolerated and effective regimen.

Phase II trial of pyrazoloacridine (NSC#366140) in patients with metastatic breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: Pyrazoloacridine (PZA) is an investigational nucleic acid binding agent that inhibits the activity of topoisomerases 1 and 2. We conducted a phase II clinical study to determine the efficacy and toxicities of PZA in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Experimental DESIGN: In this phase II multicenter study, patients who were treated with no more than one prior chemotherapy for MBC were treated with 750 mg/m² of PZA given as a 3-hour intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. Treatment cycles were continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities. The study was designed to distinguish between a response rate of < 15% vs > 30% (alpha = 0.10, beta = 0.10) using Simons optimal 2-stage design. At least 2 responses were required in the first 12 patients in the 1st stage and 6 of 35 in the 2nd stage to recommend the agent for further study. RESULTS: Two patients in the first stage had a response allowing accrual to second stage. A total of 15 patients (out of 35 planned) were treated on the study prior to premature closure. Three patients had a partial response (20%) lasting 4.5-6 months. Two patients had stable disease for 3 and 5 months. The dose limiting toxicity was granulocytopenia with ten patients requiring dose reduction or dose delay for grade 4 neutropenia. Other grade 3 and 4 toxicities include vomiting (n = 2), nausea (n = 2), neurotoxicity (n = 1), fatigue (n = 1), anemia (n = 1), dyspnea 9n = 1) and renal (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: Pyrazoloacridine demonstrated modest activity in patients with metastatic breast cancer.",1
"Combination of trastuzumab and letrozole after resistance to sequential trastuzumab and aromatase inhibitor monotherapies in patients with estrogen receptor-positive, HER-2-positive advanced breast cancer: a proof-of-concept trial (SAKK 23/03).","A sequential treatment design was chosen in this trial to ensure complete resistance to single-agent non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (AI) and trastuzumab both given as monotherapy before receiving the combination of a non-steroidal AI and trastuzumab. Key eligibility criteria included postmenopausal patients with advanced, measurable, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2)-positive disease (assessed by FISH, ratio (≥2)), hormone receptor (HR)-positive disease, and progression on prior treatment with a non-steroidal AI, e.g. letrozole or anastrozole, either in the adjuvant or in the advanced setting. Patients received standard dose trastuzumab monotherapy in step 1 and upon disease progression continued trastuzumab in combination with letrozole in step 2. The primary endpoint was clinical benefit rate (CBR) in step 2. Totally, 13 patients were enrolled. In step 1, six patients (46%) achieved CBR. Median time to progression (TTP) was 161 days (95% confidence interval (CI): 82-281). In step 2, CBR was observed in eight out of the 11 evaluable patients (73%), including one patient with partial response. Median TTP for all the 11 patients was 188 days (95% CI: 77-not reached). Results of this proof-of-concept trial suggest that complete resistance to both AI and trastuzumab can be overcome in a proportion of patients by combined treatment of AI and trastuzumab, as all patients served as their own control. Our results appear promising for a new treatment strategy that offers a chemotherapy-free option for at least a subset of patients with HR-positive, HER-2-positive breast cancer over a clinically relevant time period.",1
A prospective multicenter phase II study of oral and i.v. vinorelbine plus trastuzumab as first-line therapy in HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral and i.v. vinorelbine plus trastuzumab as first-line regimen in a patient-convenient application for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-overexpressing patients with metastatic breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-two women were enrolled in a multicenter study. The patients received i.v. vinorelbine at a dose of 25 mg/m(2) on day 1 followed by oral vinorelbine at a dose of 60 mg/m(2) on days 8 and 15 in a 3-week cycle. Standard dose trastuzumab was given at 3-week intervals. RESULTS: Complete response was observed in 7 patients (18.9%) and partial response in 19 patients (51.4%), for an overall response rate of 70.3% [95% confidence interval (CI) 53.0-84.1]. The disease control rate reached 91.9% (95% CI 78.1-98.3). The median time to progression was 9.3 months, while median overall survival reached 35.6 months. Hematological and non-hematological toxic effects were acceptable with grade 3-4 leukopenia of 14% and neutropenia of 38%; cardiac toxicity did not reach the level of clinical relevance. CONCLUSION: The combination of i.v. and oral vinorelbine plus trastuzumab demonstrates high activity and good tolerability in first-line treatment of HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. In addition, it offers convenience for the patients with only one i.v. treatment every 3 weeks.",1
Phase I/II study of biweekly vinorelbine and oxaliplatin as first-line treatment in patients with metastatic breast cancer.,"The objective of this phase I/II study was to establish the recommended dose of biweekly vinorelbine and oxaliplatin in patients with metastatic breast cancer and to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of this schedule as first-line treatment. Four different dose levels of vinorelbine and oxaliplatin were selected for the phase I study: (i) 25 and 80 mg/m²; (ii) 25 and 90 mg/m²; (iii) 25 and 100 mg/m²; and (iv) 30 and 90 mg/m²; respectively. At least three patients were treated at each dose level. Overall, 12 patients were included in the phase I trial. No dose-limiting toxicities occurred at any dose level. Therefore, the fourth dose level (30 mg/m² of vinorelbine and 90 mg/m² of oxaliplatin) every 2 weeks was selected for the phase II trial. In this part, 44 patients were included and 61% completed the eight 2-week cycles of study treatment. On an intention-to-treat basis, overall response rate was 59%, and median progression-free survival and overall survival were 9.2 months (95% confidence interval: 7.6-10.9) and 18.6 months (95% confidence interval: 14.4-22.9), respectively. The main severe toxicities were neutropenia (46%) and fatigue (14%). We conclude that the biweekly combination of vinorelbine and oxaliplatin at doses of 30 mg/m² and 90 mg/m², respectively, is highly active and well tolerated as first-line treatment for patients with metastatic breast cancer.",1
Phase I-II trial of prolonged gemcitabine infusion plus paclitaxel as a biweekly schedule for advanced breast cancer patients pretreated with anthracyclines.,"PURPOSE: Paclitaxel (PACL) plus gemcitabine (GEM) is an effective regimen for advanced breast cancer patients pretreated with anthracyclines. A prolonged GEM infusion at a fixed dose rate (FDR) of 10 mg/m²/min produces higher levels of intracellular active metabolites of GEM when compared with a standard 30-min infusion. In the present phase I/II trial, we investigated the association of FDR GEM plus PACL. METHODS: 1,200 mg/m² was the dose of GEM recommended for the phase II study, in which patients received PACL at 150 mg/m², followed by FDR GEM at 1,200 mg/m² (total GEM infusion time = 120 min), both drugs administered biweekly. RESULTS: Forty-two anthracycline-pretreated advanced breast cancer patients with disease recurrence following at least one line of chemotherapy were enrolled. Two (4.8%) and 12 (33.3%) patients experienced a complete and partial response, respectively, for an overall response rate of 38.1% (95% CI 23.4-52.8%). Median progression free survival and overall survival were 5 and 19.9 months, respectively. No statistically significant association was noted between in situ protein expression of RRM1 and BRCA1 (as assessed by immunofluorescence combined with automated quantitative analysis) and response to treatment in 15 patients with tissue available for analysis. Toxicity was mostly mild to moderate, mainly consisting of G3-G4 neutropenia (9.6%) and hypertransaminasemia (9.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Biweekly FDR GEM in combination with PACL is an active and safe regimen for advanced breast cancer patients pretreated with anthracyclines. A prolonged infusion regimen of GEM does not seem to improve the efficacy of a standard 30-min infusion.",1
Results of a phase II study of pemetrexed as first-line chemotherapy in patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer.,"Palliation is the primary goal in metastatic breast cancer (MBC), and safe, efficacious, new single-agent options are needed. Pemetrexed, an antifolate, inhibits several folate-dependent enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis. The primary goal of this study was to determine the objective response rate in patients with advanced or MBC given pemetrexed as a first-line, dose-dense, every 2-week chemotherapy. Women with HER2-negative advanced or MBC, without prior cytotoxic treatment for this stage of disease, were treated with intravenous pemetrexed 600 mg/m² on Day 1 of each 14-day cycle. Standard dexamethasone, folic acid, and vitamin B(12) premedications were given. 37 patients enrolled; 36 received ≥ 1 dose of pemetrexed and 35 were evaluable for response. Median age of patients was 61.4 years, 76% were hormone receptor positive (ER+ and/or PR+). Prior treatment included adjuvant chemotherapy (57%) and/or endocrine (65%). Patients received a median of 6 cycles of pemetrexed (range, 1-21). Based on 35 evaluable patients, the overall response rate (ORR) was 26% (1 CR and 8 PR), and the clinical benefit rate (CR+ PR+ stable disease [SD] ≥ 6 months) was 40%. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.1 months (range, <1-22.4). Median overall survival (OS) was 18.9 months (range, <1-27.7). Grades 3-4 treatment-related toxicities included: neutropenia (36%), leukopenia (17%), fatigue (14%), and anemia (14%). Grade 1/2 alopecia was seen in 8% of patients. This phase II study of dose-dense, single-agent pemetrexed showed moderate activity in the first-line setting with acceptable toxicity and no significant alopecia.",1
Carboplatin and gemcitabine combination in metastatic triple-negative anthracycline- and taxane-pretreated breast cancer patients: a phase II study.,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by lack of hormone receptors and HER-2 and shares many features with BRCA1-associated cancer. Preclinical data indicate cisplatin sensitivity, suggesting that these tumors may have defects in the BRCA1 pathway. The carboplatin and gemcitabine (CG) combination is active in unselected anthracycline/taxane pretreated metastatic breast cancer patients, so we carried out a phase II study to evaluate the activity of the CG combination in pretreated metastatic TNBC patients. From 10/2004 to 3/2009 we enrolled 31 patients. Median age was 57 years and 29 patients out of 31 had visceral involvement. The overall response rate (ORR) was 32% (1 complete response /9 partial responses), in addition 5 patients obtained stable disease for >12 weeks. After a median follow-up of 34 months, all patients progressed with a median time to progression of 5.5 months and median overall survival of 11 months. Dose reductions, delays and omissions occurred in 75 (60%), 36 (29%) and 22 (18%) cycles. Grade 3/4 neutropenia occurred in 17 and febrile neutropenia in 4 patients. Ten patients had Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia. Non hematological toxicities were manageable. The CG combination is a reasonable option for the treatment of metastatic pretreated TNBC patients.",1
A Phase II Study of Weekly Nanoparticle Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel With or Without Trastuzumab in Metastatic Breast Cancer.,"Introduction: Weekly administration of nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab) paclitaxel as a first-line treatment for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) has not been fully investigated. The addition of trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), is less understood. This phase II study evaluated the efficacy and safety of weekly nab paclitaxel in the first-line MBC setting. Patients whose tumors overexpressed HER2 also received trastuzumab. Patients and Methods: Patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer received nab paclitaxel (125 mg/m2) by 30-minute intravenous infusion weekly for 3 of 4 weeks. Patients who were HER2-positive received concurrent trastuzumab. Results: Seventy-two patients were enrolled; HER2 expression was detected in 22 patients. The overall response rate (ORR) was 42.2% (95% CI, 30%-55%); 5 patients had a complete response (CR) and 22 patients had a partial response (PR). Additionally, 17 patients experienced stable disease (SD), providing an overall benefit (CR + PR + SD) of 68.8%. Patients with HER2-positive tumors had an ORR of 52.4%; the ORR was 38.1% in the HER2-negative population (P = .3). Median progression-free survival was 14.5 months (range, 1-49.3 months) and survival rates at 1 year and 2 years were 69% and 62%, respectively. The most commonly observed toxicities were pain (64%), fatigue (58%), sensory neuropathy (54%), infection (46%), nausea (38%), alopecia (33%), and anemia (33%). Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that weekly nab paclitaxel has a favorable safety profile and is well tolerated as a first-line treatment for MBC. An ORR of 42% and an overall benefit of 69% is extremely encouraging, particularly in the HER2-positive population where 52% of patients responded.",1
Phase I/II study of sorafenib with anastrozole in patients with hormone receptor positive aromatase inhibitor resistant metastatic breast cancer.,"We evaluated the use of sorafenib to overcome resistance to aromatase inhibitors (AIs) in patients with metastatic breast cancer who had disease recurrence or progression while on AIs. We performed a multi-institution phase I/II study of sorafenib and anastrozole 1 mg daily in 35 postmenopausal females with hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer resistant to AIs. Primary objectives were to determine the dose of sorafenib in conjunction with anastrozole and the clinical benefit rate (CBR) (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], or stable disease [SD] ≥ 24 weeks). Secondary objectives were to determine toxicity and to evaluate if response was associated with change in number of circulating endothelial cells or circulating endothelial progenitor cells. Based on the phase I portion, sorafenib 400 mg twice daily was selected as the phase II dose. Among 35 patients, 7 had SD ≥ 24 weeks, 1 had PR ≥ 24 weeks, and 14 had progressive disease (PD) ≤ 24 weeks, corresponding to a CBR of 23%. The most common adverse events (all; Grade 3/4) were fatigue (66%; 17%), diarrhea (63%; 6%), nausea (60%; 9%), and hand-foot syndrome (57%; 34%). Dose reduction occurred in 77% of the patients and 31% came off study due to toxicity. The combination of sorafenib and anastrozole demonstrated a 23% CBR in patients with hormone receptor positive, AI-resistant metastatic breast cancer, which may be attributable to the restoration of sensitivity to AIs. Toxicities occurred frequently resulting in a high rate of discontinuation.",1
A multicenter phase II randomized trial of docetaxel/gemcitabine versus docetaxel/capecitabine as first-line treatment for advanced breast cancer: a Gruppo Oncologico Italia Meridionale study.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate two docetaxel-based regimens as first-line treatment in advanced breast cancer patients. METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to docetaxel/gemcitabine (arm A: docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) on day 1, gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8) or docetaxel/capecitabine (arm B: docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) on day 1, capecitabine 1,250 mg/m(2) twice daily on days 1-14); both chemotherapy regimens were repeated every 21 days. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the response rate. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients were enrolled (36 each in arms A and B). Responses according to intention-to-treat analysis were as follows: arm A, 41.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 25.6-57.8]; arm B, 38.9% (95% CI 23-54.8). Median progression-free survival was 10.9 months (95% CI 8.1-13.7) in arm A and 10 months (95% CI 8.8-11.2) in arm B. Overall survival was 26 months (95% CI 22.0-30.0) in arm A and 28 months (95% CI 23.4-32.6) in arm B. Both treatments were well tolerated; myelosuppression was the dose-limiting toxicity, with grade 3-4 neutropenia in 13.8 and 19.4% of the patients in arms A and B, respectively. No relevant differences in other toxicities were observed in the two arms, except for diarrhea (13.9%) and hand-foot syndrome (11.1%), which occurred only in arm B. CONCLUSIONS: Both regimens were active and well tolerated in advanced breast cancer.",1
A phase II study of gemcitabine plus paclitaxel in patients with metastatic breast cancer and prior anthracycline treatment.,"AIM: To investigate the efficacy and safety of gemcitabine-paclitaxel in Chinese patients with metastatic breast cancer following anthracycline failure in a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase II clinical trial. METHODS: Chinese female patients with unresectable, locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer who had relapsed after neo-adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy were included. All patients had measurable disease and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 at baseline. Gemcitabine (1250 mg/m(2) )-paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2) ) was administered on a 3-weekly schedule until disease progression, and patients were followed up for 12 months (post-enrollment). The primary end point was objective response rate; secondary end points included duration of response, progression-free survival and overall survival. RESULTS: Overall 60 patients were enrolled. Their mean age was 46.9 (SD ± 9.0) years and 90% of patients had metastatic disease. All patients had previously received chemotherapy. A total of 48 patients (80%) completed the 12-month follow up, and 40 patients (67%) completed at least six cycles of study therapy. The objective response rate (complete response + partial response) was 50% (95% CI: 36.6-63.4). Median duration of response was 5.6 months (95% CI: 4.4-7.6) and median progression-free survival was 7.6 months (95% CI: 5.8-8.8). Overall survival at 12 months was 87% (95% CI: 77.9-95.2). Laboratory toxicities were primarily hematologic, including Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia (n = 27 [45%]) and leukopenia (n = 18 [30%]). Eight patient deaths (13%) were not treatment-related. CONCLUSION: Gemcitabine-paclitaxel combination therapy is an active and well-tolerated chemotherapy regimen, with expected and manageable toxicity in Chinese patients with metastatic breast cancer.",1
Phase II study of bortezomib and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Based on preclinical studies and a phase I trial of the combination of bortezomib and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD), which both showed activity in breast cancer, we conducted a phase II study of this regimen in patients with metastatic breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of an every-21-day cycle, along with PLD 30 mg/m2 on day 4. The primary objective was to evaluate the response rate of this combination, while secondary objectives were to obtain further safety data about this combination, to evaluate the time to disease progression (TTP), and to evaluate response by the breast cancer subtype. RESULTS: One of 12 evaluable patients had a partial response (8%), while 3 (25%) had stable disease. At 26 months follow-up, the median overall survival was 4.3 months (95% CI, 1.2-26.2) and the median TTP was 1.3 months (95% CI, 0.8-14.0 months). The combination was well tolerated, with the most common events including low-grade nausea and vomiting, neutropenia, and neuropathy, and no cardiac toxicity was seen. Of the 7 tumors subtyped, no association was seen between intrinsic subtype or receptor status and response. CONCLUSION: The combination of PLD and bortezomib was well tolerated but has minimal activity in heavily pretreated unselected metastatic breast cancer.",1
First-line therapy with moderate dose capecitabine in metastatic breast cancer is safe and active: results of the MONICA trial.,"BACKGROUND: To determine activity and safety of capecitabine at a moderate dose of 2000 mg/m(2) as first-line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. METHODS: In this prospective phase II trial, patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer received first-line capecitabine 2000 mg/m(2) on days 1-14 every 3 weeks. The primary aim was to exclude a time to progression (TTP) <6 months. Secondary end-points were overall response rate, overall survival (OS), toxicity and quality of life. RESULTS: Median age of the 161 included patients was 65 years. Median TTP and OS were 7.3 months [95% (confidence interval) CI: 6.2-8.4] and 17.1 months (95% CI: 14.0-20.3), respectively. An overall response rate of 26.1%, including 13 complete remissions was observed. Patients developing grade I-III hand-foot syndrome had a significantly longer TTP and OS and patients >65 years also achieved a significantly longer TTP. Haematological grade I-IV toxicities were leucopenia (64.0%), anaemia (50.9%) and thrombocytopenia (28.0%). Relevant non-haematological toxicities were hand-food-syndrome (37.3%), fatigue (34.2%), nausea (29.8%) and diarrhoea (20.5%). Quality of life assessment revealed an improved emotional function, but worsening of nausea and vomiting from cycle 1-10. CONCLUSIONS: Capecitabine at a dose of 2000 mg/m(2) is active and safe as first-line treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer.",1
Phase II study of gemcitabine and carboplatin in metastatic breast cancers with prior exposure to anthracyclines and taxanes.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) are usually exposed to both anthracyclines and taxanes during neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment of primary breast cancer or during initial therapy of MBC. We investigate the combination of gemcitabine and carboplatin in MBC with prior exposure to both anthracyclines and taxanes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: MBC patients previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes were enrolled in a single tertiary center phase II study. Treatment consisted of gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m(2) I.V on days 1 and 8) and carboplatin (AUC 5 I.V on day 1) administered every 3 weeks. Results 41 patients were recruited. Objective response rate was 39% including 1 complete response (2%) and 15 partial responses (37%). Twelve patients (29%) had stable disease. Median time to progression was 4.6 months (95% CI 3.3-5.9 months) and median overall survival 10.5 months (95% CI 7.6-13.4 months). Grade 3 & 4 hematological toxicities included neutropenia (58%), febrile neutropenia (15%), anemia (12%) and thrombocytopenia (49%), including 7% who required platelet transfusions. Non-hematological toxicity was rarely severe. 56% of patients required at least one dose reduction; the mean relative dose intensity for gemcitabine and carboplatin were 0.82 (range 0.5-1.0) and 0.95 (range 0.75-1.00) respectively, with no difference in dose intensity between responders and non-responders. CONCLUSION: Gemcitabine combined with carboplatin has promising efficacy in MBC with prior treatment with anthracyclines and taxanes but has significant haematological toxicities requiring dose modifications. The regimen may be modified to gemcitabine 800 mg/m(2) days 1 and 8 to improve tolerability.",1
A phase II trial of vinflunine as monotherapy or in combination with trastuzumab as first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer.,"We investigated the microtubulin inhibitor vinflunine—with trastuzumab in human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-positive patients—as first-line metastatic breast cancer therapy. HER2-negative patients received vinflunine on day 1; HER2-positive patients received vinflunine/trastuzumab every 21 days. Forty-eight patients in each treatment group were planned; the sponsor terminated the study early. Thirty-two evaluable patients (vinflunine, 11; vinflunine/trastuzumab, 21) were enrolled. In HER2-positive patients, vinflunine/trastuzumab produced an objective response rate (33%), clinical benefit rate (71%), and progression-free survival (6.2 months). Grade-3/4 neutropenia occurred in 14 (44%) patients; gastrointestinal toxicities were common and six patients were hospitalized for treatment-related toxicity. The vinflunine/trastuzumab combination was active and well tolerated, but our results do not suggest advantages over taxane/trastuzumab or vinorelbine/trastuzumab.",1
A multicentre Phase II study of non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel as first-line therapy in metastatic breast cancer.,"To evaluate the cardiotoxicity, general toxicity, and activity of non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, in combination with docetaxel and trastuzumab, as first-line therapy in metastatic breast cancer. Thirty-one patients with metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-overexpressing breast cancer, who had not previously received chemotherapy for metastatic disease, received non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (50 mg/m(2)), docetaxel (75 mg/m(2)) and trastuzumab (2 mg/kg/week) for up to eight cycles, followed by trastuzumab alone for up to 52 weeks. Cardiotoxicity was defined as a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to below 45%, or a decrease in LVEF of at least 20% from baseline. Mean LVEF was maintained at baseline level also in the subset of patients who had received anthracycline previously. Cardiotoxicity developed in three patients during the treatment cycles, and in two further patients after the end of the study. The most common adverse events were haematological toxicity, alopecia, asthenia and fever. The best overall response rate was 65.5%. Median time to progression was 13.0 months. The combination of non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, docetaxel and trastuzumab combines acceptable cardiac and general toxicity and promising activity as first-line therapy in metastatic breast cancer.",1
Phase II study of 4-weekly capecitabine monotherapy in advanced/metastatic breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: A multicenter, phase II study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Japanese intermittent 4-week regimen of capecitabine in patients with advanced/metastatic breast cancer. METHODS: Fifty patients who had received no more than one prior chemotherapy regimen for advanced/metastatic disease were enrolled from 23 centers and received at least two 4-weekly cycles of capecitabine (828 mg/m² orally twice daily for 3 weeks followed by a 1-week rest period). RESULTS: The overall response rate assessed by the Independent Review Committee (standard population, n = 46) was 28.3% (95% confidence interval 16.0-43.5%), including complete responses in 6.5%. Stable disease was observed in 20 patients and maintained for more than 6 months in 10 patients. The median duration of response in 13 evaluable responders was 5.3 months. Among evaluable patients (n = 47), median time to disease progression was 5.1 months. Median overall survival was 20.2 months. The most common treatment-related adverse events (all grades) were hand-foot syndrome (66%), nausea (26%), stomatitis (22%) and diarrhea (20%). Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events were seen in 23 patients (46%). The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were lymphocytopenia (22%), hand-foot syndrome (18%) and hyperbilirubinemia (10%). CONCLUSIONS: Although the target overall response rate was not reached, the Japanese intermittent 4-week regimen of capecitabine was shown to be an effective and well-tolerated first- or second-line therapy for advanced/metastatic breast cancer.",1
A phase II trial of oxaliplatin and trastuzumab in the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.,"We investigated the feasibility/efficacy of oxaliplatin in combination with trastuzumab as first-/second-line treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Patients received oxaliplatin/trastuzumab every 21 days and were evaluated every 6 weeks using RECIST criteria. The study closed early due to slow accrual. Twenty-five patients were evaluable; of these, 5 (20%) had objective responses to oxaliplatin/trastuzumab. Therapy was well tolerated (no grade-4 and gastrointestinal grade-3 toxicity in 4% of patients), but had only modest activity (median time-to-progression 1.8 months). Substitution of oxaliplatin for cisplatin or carboplatin, in combination with trastuzumab, does not appear to improve first-/second-line therapy in HER2-positive MBC.",1
"Final results of a phase II study of nab-paclitaxel, bevacizumab, and gemcitabine as first-line therapy for patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer.","In order to examine the efficacy and safety of nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-P) in combination with bevacizumab (B) and gemcitabine (G) for the first-line treatment of patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC). In this single-center, open-label phase II trial, patients with HER2-negative MBC received gemcitabine 1500 mg/m(2), nab-paclitaxel 150 mg/m(2), and bevacizumab 10 mg/kg (each administered intravenously) on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle. The primary end point was progression free survival (PFS); secondary end points were overall response rate (ORR), complete (CR) and partial (PR) response rates, clinical benefit (ORR + stable disease), overall survival (OS), and safety. Thirty patients were enrolled. One patient was ineligible and was not included in analysis. Median PFS was 10.4 months (95% CI: 5.6-15.2 months). ORR was 75.9%, comprising eight (27.6%) CRs and 14 (48.3%) PRs; five patients had stable disease (SD) and two patients (6.9%) had progressive disease (PD) as their best response. The clinical benefit rate was 93.1% (27/29) in the overall group and 84.6% in the triple-negative cohort (11/13). The 18-month survival rate was 77.2% (95% CI: 51.1-90.5%). Eight (27.6%) patients experienced grade 3 or 4 toxicity: grade 4 neutropenic fever (n = 1) and grade 3 infection (n = 6), leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, peripheral neuropathy, seizure, shortness of breath, hematuria, and cardiac tamponade (one each). First-line therapy with nab-P, B, and G demonstrated a median PFS of 10.4 months and a 75.9% ORR with acceptable toxicity; this novel combination warrants investigation in a randomized study.",1
"Phase II trial of anastrozole plus goserelin in the treatment of hormone receptor-positive, metastatic carcinoma of the breast in premenopausal women.","PURPOSE: To explore the antitumor activity of the aromatase inhibitor, anastrozole, in the treatment of premenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, metastatic breast cancer who have been rendered functionally postmenopausal with the use of the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist, goserelin. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Premenopausal women with estrogen and/or progesterone receptor-positive, metastatic or recurrent breast cancer were enrolled in this prospective, single-arm, multicenter phase II trial. Patients were treated with goserelin 3.6 mg subcutaneous monthly and began anastrozole 1-mg daily 21 days after the first injection of goserelin. Patients continued on treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were enrolled of which 32 were evaluable for response and toxicity. Estradiol suppression was assessed, with mean estradiol levels of 18.7 pg/mL at 3 months and 14.8 pg/mL at 6 months. One participant (3.1%) experienced a complete response, 11 (34.4%) experienced partial response, and 11 (34.4%) experienced stable disease for 6 months or longer for a clinical benefit rate of 71.9%. Median time to progression was 8.3 months (range, 2.1 to 63+) and median survival was not been reached (range, 11.1 to 63+). The most common adverse events were fatigue (50%), arthralgias (53%), and hot flashes (59%). There were no grade 4 to 5 toxicities. CONCLUSION: The combination of goserelin plus anastrozole has substantial antitumor activity in the treatment of premenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer.",1
Exemestane and chemotherapy as first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer: results of a phase II study.,"BACKGROUND: Metastatic breast cancer remains largely incurable. Strategies involving the combination of the selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen and chemotherapy have been abandoned in view of unacceptable toxicity because of thromboembolic events. The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of the third-generation steroidal aromatase inhibitor exemestane plus chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer received 6 cycles of intravenous chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil [5-FU], epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide) and exemestane 25 mg/day that was continued after chemotherapy was completed. The primary efficacy endpoint was time to progression (TTP), and response rates were also assessed. Safety was assessed from adverse events. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (median age, 62 years) were included in this study. Twenty patients completed 6 chemotherapy cycles. Median TTP was 13.7 months. Overall response was achieved by 20 patients (73.9%), and the clinical benefit rate was 87%. During the chemotherapy plus exemestane treatments, 50 adverse events were reported in 14 of the 23 patients (60.9%). As expected, the incidence of adverse events decreased during the phase of exemestane treatment alone (19 adverse events in 10 of 20 patients [50%]). There were 2 grade 4 events reported, pulmonary embolism and pneumonia, although pneumonia was not considered to be related. CONCLUSION: Although a small number of patients were included, the combination of exemestane and chemotherapy was well tolerated and only 1 thromboembolic event was reported. Response rates were similar to other comparable series and may encourage further studies to confirm the efficacy of chemotherapy in combination with an aromatase inhibitor.",1
Phase II trial of weekly nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel with carboplatin and trastuzumab as first-line therapy for women with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: This multicenter phase II trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of weekly nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel with carboplatin and weekly trastuzumab as first-line therapy for women with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer (MBC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We treated 32 patients who had measurable MBC that was HER2-positive defined by an immunohistochemical staining score of 3+ or gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization, required for those with an IHC of 2+. Patients were treated with albumin-bound paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 and carboplatin at area under the curve (AUC) = 2 on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. Trastuzumab was administered at 2 mg/kg weekly after a loading dose of 4 mg/kg. Because of hypersensitivity reactions occurring during carboplatin infusion numbers 6-8 in 4 of the first 13 patients with this premedication-free regimen, the protocol was amended for carboplatin and dosed at AUC = 6 day 1 each 28-day cycle, in lieu of introducing steroid prophylaxis. Patients were treated with 6 cycles and allowed to continue with all 3 drugs or trastuzumab alone if free of progression and unacceptable toxicity after 6 cycles. RESULTS: The overall response rate (ORR) was 62.5% (95% CI, 45.7%-79.3%) with 3 confirmed complete responders (CRs; 9%) and 17 confirmed partial responses (PRs; 53%). An additional 6 patients (19%) had stable disease (SD) for greater than 16 weeks for a clinical benefit rate (ORR + SD > 16 weeks) of 81%. As of April 16, 2009, 20 patients (63%) had progressed with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 16.6 months (95% CI, 7.5-26.5 months). Antitumor activity was similar for patients treated with weekly carboplatin and every-4-week carboplatin (ORR, 65% vs. 67%, respectively). Hematologic toxicities were the only grade 4 toxicities noted and were infrequent with grade 4 neutropenia in 3 patients (9%) and 1 febrile neutropenia. Grade 2/3 peripheral neuropathy was uncommon (13%/3%). CONCLUSION: Weekly albumin-bound paclitaxel with carboplatin and trastuzumab is highly active in HER2-overexpressing MBC. In the absence of corticosteroid premedication, which we avoided with albumin-bound paclitaxel, carboplatin seems best dosed every 4 weeks rather than weekly because of carboplatin-associated hypersensitivity reactions. The regimen was very well tolerated with few grade 3 and 4 nonhematologic toxicities experienced, and severe hematologic toxicity and peripheral neuropathy were infrequent.",1
Gemcitabine and capecitabine in previously anthracycline-treated metastatic breast cancer: a multicenter phase II study (SOLTI 0301 trial).,"BACKGROUND: On the basis of clinical activity of capecitabine and gemcitabine for metastatic breast cancer, we carried out a multicenter phase II clinical trial on the combination of these two agents in advanced anthracycline-pretreated breast cancer patients. Main objectives were to assess its efficacy and safety profile. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-six anthracycline-pretreated breast cancer patients were evaluated and were stratified according to previous treatment of advanced disease (group-1: not previously treated and group-2: previously treated). Study treatment consisted of gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2), i.v., as 30 min-infusion, days 1 and 8 every 21 days, plus oral capecitabine 830 mg/m(2) b.i.d., days 1-14 every 21 days. RESULTS: Overall response rate was 61% for group-1, 48.5% for group-2 and 55.2% for the whole population. Clinical benefit rate was 73% for group-1, 80% for patients in group-2 and 76% for all patients. Median time to progression was 13.0 months for group-1, 8.2 months for group-2 and 11.1 months for the whole population. Most frequent grade 3-4 observed toxic effects per patient were neutropenia (60%), asymptomatic liver toxicity (13.5%), asthenia (14%) and hand-foot syndrome (16%). Only one patient presented febrile neutropenia. No treatment-related deaths occurred. CONCLUSION: Combination of gemcitabine and capecitabine is an active and safe regimen in anthracycline-pretreated breast cancer patients.",1
Trastuzumab plus capecitabine and docetaxel as first-line therapy for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer: phase II results.,"In human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER-2)-positive advanced breast cancer, taxanes plus trastuzumab are among the most widely applied options in the first-line setting. The addition of capecitabine to docetaxel significantly improves overall survival in anthracycline-pretreated metastatic breast cancer. We evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of trastuzumab plus capecitabine and docetaxel regimen as first-line therapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS: HER-2-positive patients who had received adjuvant anthracyclines received docetaxel at 75 mg/m(2) on day 1 and capecitabine 950 mg/m(2)/day, days 1-14, every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Trastuzumab was administered at a dose of 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Time to progression (TTP) was defined as the primary end point. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were evaluable (median age 52, range 34-70 years). The regimen achieved objective responses in 11 patients (38%), including complete response in three (10.3%) and partial response in eight (27.5%). The median overall survival time was 25.5 months, and the median progression-free survival time was 7.8 months. The safety profile of the combination was favorable and predictable, with a low incidence of grade 3/4 adverse events. The most common adverse events were hand-foot syndrome, and gastrointestinal toxicities. Severe myelosuppression was rare and cardiac toxicity did not occur. CONCLUSION: These data confirm that the combination of trastuzumab plus capecitabine and docetaxel is highly active in patients with HER-2-overexpressing anthracycline-pretreated breast cancer, offering a significant survival benefit and is well tolerated.",1
Weekly pegylated liposomal doxorubicin and paclitaxel in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma: A phase II study.,"Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) has the advantage of delivering active anthracycline directly to the tumor site, while exposing the patient to a lesser degree of doxorubicin-associated toxicities. Recently, a regimen in which paclitaxel is infused weekly over 1 h produced substantial antitumor activity with little myelosuppression. We designed a phase II trial to study the efficacy and toxicity of 10 mg/m(2) PLD on Days 1, 8 and 15, plus 70 mg/m(2) paclitaxel weekly in patients with untreated metastatic breast cancer and a high risk of cardiotoxicity. The study included 35 patients, with 31 (88.5%) evaluable for efficacy and 35 (100%) for toxicity. A total of 28 patients (80%) had two or more sites of disease. Overall, 4 complete and 16 partial responses were noted with an overall response rate of 64.5%, with 6 cases of stable and 5 cases of progressive disease. Toxicity was found to be manageable in that the only grade 3-4 side effects recorded were palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, 8.5%; mucositis, 2.8%; leucopenia, 12.5%; anemia, 2.8% and AST/ALT, 2.8%. No cardiotoxicity was observed. In conclusion, weekly PLD plus paclitaxel appears to be a well-tolerated and effective approach for metastatic breast cancer patients with a high risk of cardiotoxicity.",1
Phase II parallel group study showing comparable efficacy between premenopausal metastatic breast cancer patients treated with letrozole plus goserelin and postmenopausal patients treated with letrozole alone as first-line hormone therapy.,"PURPOSE: Goserelin and letrozole in premenopausal patients can result in clinical outcomes comparable to those obtained by letrozole alone in postmenopausal patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 73 patients with hormone-responsive MBC were included. Of those, 35 premenopausal patients received goserelin (3.6 mg subcutaneously every 28 days) plus letrozole (2.5 mg orally daily), and 38 postmenopausal patients received letrozole alone as their first-line endocrine therapy in a metastatic setting. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups, except for a younger age (median, 41 v 53.5 years; P < .001) and a shorter disease-free interval (median, 1.8 v 3.3 years; P = .03) in the premenopausal group. Clinical benefit rates were comparable between the two groups (77% v 74%; P = .77). With the median follow-up of 27.4 months, there was no statistical difference in the median time to progression between the two groups (9.5 months [95% CI, 6.4 to 12.1 months] v 8.9 months [95% CI, 6.4 to 13.3 months]). In patients who did not receive bisphosphonate, letrozole +/- goserelin caused a greater loss of bone mineral density at 6 months compared with that of patients receiving bisphosphonate treatment (premenopausal group, -16.7% v 53.9%; P = .002 and postmenopausal group, -13.3% v 17.4%; P = .04 at the lumbar spine). CONCLUSION: Clinical efficacies in premenopausal MBC patients with combined letrozole and goserelin therapy were comparable to those in postmenopausal patients treated with letrozole alone. Although letrozole +/- goserelin resulted in a modest increase in bone resorption, concurrent treatment with bisphosphonate could prevent bone loss at 6 months.",1
A phase 2 study of a fixed combination of uracil and ftorafur and leucovorin given orally in a twice-daily regimen to treat patients with recurrent metastatic breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: UFT, a combination of uracil and ftorafur, was developed to combine the cytotoxic effects of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with convenient oral dosing. Leucovorin is combined with UFT to further potentiate the effect of 5-FU on tumor cells. Orally administered UFT and leucovorin provide higher peak plasma concentrations of 5-FU and prolonged therapeutic 5-FU concentrations compared with continuous infusion of 5-FU. METHODS: Ninety-four patients with metastatic breast cancer who had been previously treated with anthracyclines and/or taxanes were treated with UFT and leucovorin, given orally, for the first 28 days of a 35-day cycle. The total daily dose of UFT was 300 mg/m(2), which was given in 2 divided doses every 12 hours. The primary endpoint was time to disease progression (TTP). Secondary objectives included overall tumor response rate (OR = complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Of the 94 patients enrolled, 68 were evaluable for efficacy. Although no CRs were observed, 9 patients achieved PRs, for an OR of 13.2% in the evaluable population. The median TTP for the evaluable population was 10.3 weeks, and the proportion of patients free of disease progression at 6 months was 17%. The median OS was 61.6 weeks for all patients enrolled. The most common drug-related >or= grade 3 adverse events (graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 2) were diarrhea, asthenia, nausea, and dehydration. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of UFT and leucovorin administered orally in a twice-daily regimen was found to have modest activity. Grade 3 toxicities were manageable with appropriate dose adjustments in patients with metastatic breast cancer previously treated with anthracyclines and/or taxanes.",1
Phase II trial of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin plus docetaxel with and without trastuzumab in metastatic breast cancer: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group trial E3198.,"The purpose of this trial was to determine cardiac toxicity and overall efficacy of the pegylated liposome doxorubicin (PLD)-docetaxel couplet alone if HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (internal control) or with trastuzumab if HER2-positive disease. Upon central HER2 confirmation, 84 eligible patients received induction with PLD (30 mg/m(2)) and docetaxel (60 mg/m(2)) every 3 weeks (maximum eight cycles), alone if HER2-negative (arm A; N = 38) or plus trastuzumab (4 mg/kg once, then 2 mg/kg weekly) if HER2-positive disease (arm B; N = 46) as first-line therapy. Maintenance therapy (without PLD) allowed. Primary objectives were to determine whether congestive heart failure (CHF) rate >3% and the efficacy/toxicity of each arm. CHF rate was <3% in each arm. Response rate, median progression-free-, and overall survival in arms A and B were 47.4 and 45.7%, 11 and 10.6 months, and 24.6 and 31.8 months, respectively. Trastuzumab arm was associated with higher rates of hand foot syndrome (grade 3: 22 vs. 38%; P = 0.16; overall 51 vs. 75%, P = 0.03) and treatment discontinuation due to toxicity/patient withdrawal (13 vs. 28%; P = 0.11). Febrile neutropenia occurred in approximately 10% of patients. In conclusion, concurrent administration of trastuzumab with PLD-docetaxel was not associated with higher risk of cardiac toxicity compared with PLD-docetaxel alone, but led to excessive hand-foot syndrome.",1

Clinical trial of high-dose oral medroxyprogesterone acetate in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer and review of the literature.,"Recent studies have suggested that there are benefits from the use of high-dose parenteral medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. The present study was designed to assess the efficacy and toxicity of high-dose oral MPA in women with clinical parameters suggesting potentially hormonally sensitive metastatic breast cancer. The first 28 patients received 800 mg/day, and 11 of them had received no previous hormone (NPH) therapy. The response rate (complete plus partial) was 63% for those receiving NPH and 12% for those receiving previous hormone (PH) therapy. Toxicity was significant at these doses, especially for women treated for more than 5 weeks. Toxic effects included excessive weight gain, Cushingoid facies, worsening of diabetes mellitus, and other stigmata suggestive of hypercorticism. Nineteen other patients were treated at 400 mg/day with a 60% response rate for 10 NPH patients and 44% for patients with PH treatment. Toxicity was less severe in these patients. The median time to treatment failure was 23 weeks, and to survival, 119 weeks for all treated patients. Moderately high (400 mg/d) and higher dose (800 mg/d) oral MPA are capable of inducing reasonable response rates in patients with NPH treatment. The toxicity of these regimens was significant--profound weight gain was dose limiting in some patients. While effective, high-dose oral MPA is unlikely to supplant tamoxifen as first-line therapy in metastatic breast cancer.",0
"Clinical trial of iproplatin (cis-dichloro-trans-dihydroxy-bis-isopropylamine platinum IV, CHIP) in patients with advanced breast cancer.","Twenty-five women with advanced breast cancer were treated in a phase II trial of iproplatin 275 mg/m2 administered intravenously every 4 weeks. All patients had measurable or evaluable indicator lesions, and had undergone treatment with no more than one previous chemotherapy regimen, including adjuvant chemotherapy. Two of the twenty-four evaluable patients (8%) experienced major therapeutic responses. One patient had a complete regression of pulmonary nodules lasting 18+ months; another had a partial regression of metastatic disease in the liver (4 months). The inevaluable patient was ineligible for the study because of previous radiation to the indicator lesions on her chest wall; nonetheless, she experienced a 10 month partial regression of those nodules. Myelosuppression was generally dose limiting; thrombocytopenia was more profound, but leukopenia was more prolonged. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and general malaise were prominent toxicities, and led to discontinuation of therapy in 4 patients. Iproplatin has limited activity in previously treated women with advanced breast cancer.",1
"Phase II study of the antifolate N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid (CB 3717) in advanced breast cancer.","Fifty-two patients with progressive advanced breast cancer were treated with the novel antifolate CB 3717 (N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazofolic acid) which inhibits thymidylate synthetase. Forty-six patients were pretreated with hormones, 43 with cytotoxic chemotherapy and 39 patients with both treatments. Eight of 48 patients (16.6%) evaluable for response had partial responses (confidence limits 7.4-30.2%, 95% confidence level) following CB 3717 administration. Liver function abnormalities, reversible in most cases, were the most commonest toxicities and were frequently accompanied by malaise. Severe renal failure occurred in eight patients, five of whom had had partial responses to CB 3717. This study shows the importance of thymidylate synthetase as a target for therapy but the clinical value of CB 3717 is limited by its hepatic and renal toxicities.",1
"Toremifene, a new antiestrogenic compound, for treatment of advanced breast cancer. Phase II study.","Forty-six postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor positive advanced breast cancer were treated with the novel antiestrogen toremifene in this phase II study. The patients had no prior or concurrent hormonal or cytostatic treatment. Sixty milligrams of toremifene was given as a single daily dose for a minimum treatment period of 6 weeks. Eight patients (17%) achieved complete response, 17 (37%) partial response and 12 (26%) showed no change. The median durations of responses were 93, 66 and 24 weeks, respectively. Three patients still continue the treatment in complete response, four patients in partial response. No significant differences in response rates could be seen when related to different estrogen receptor concentrations. The treatment was well tolerated, only two patients had remarkable side-effects; one of the patients interrupted the treatment mainly because of tremor. Our conclusion is that toremifene is an effective, safe and in clinical practice easily applied choice of treatment in estrogen receptor positive advanced breast cancer.",1
Phase II evaluation of teniposide (VM-26) in metastatic breast carcinoma. A Southeastern Cancer Study Group trial.,The Southeastern Cancer Study Group performed a Phase II study of teniposide in previously treated patients with metastatic breast cancer. No responses were observed in 11 evaluable patients who received teniposide 60 mg/m2 by IV infusion for five consecutive days every three weeks. Toxicity was primarily gastrointestinal and hematologic and was frequently severe. This study demonstrated no therapeutic activity for teniposide when given in this dose and schedule to patients with heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer.,1
Trimetrexate: a phase 2 study in previously treated patients with metastatic breast cancer.,"Trimetrexate, a nonclassical antifolate, was administered to 28 patients with progressive, metastatic breast cancer. The starting dose was 8 mg/m2 administered intravenously (IV) as a short infusion daily for 5 days, repeated every 3 weeks with dose adjustments depending on patient tolerance. The median age of the 28 females in this study was 58.5 years. Their median performance status on the Zubrod scale was 1. Nine of the patients were estrogen-receptor positive. The sites of metastasis included the pulmonary system (50%), bone (40%), and liver (35%). Twenty patients were evaluable for response. Three patients (15%; [95% confidence interval 0.0, 30.6]) achieved a partial response with a median time to partial response of 9.1 weeks and a median duration of partial response of 13.1 weeks. Two of the responders were estrogen-receptor positive. Median survival for all 28 patients was 41 + weeks with 15 patients alive at the last follow-up. Hematologic grade 3-4 toxicity occurred as follows: leukopenia (21%), thrombocytopenia (18%), and granulocytopenia (18%). There was no significant nonhematologic toxicity seen.",1
Primary chemotherapy with mitoxantrone and prednisone in advanced breast carcinoma. A phase II study.,"Thirty-seven evaluable patients with progressive disseminated breast carcinoma were treated with a combination of mitoxantrone 14 mg/m2 i.v. every 3 weeks plus prednisone 20 mg/m2 p.o. daily with a reducing dose over several weeks. Thirteen of 37 patients (35%) achieved an objective response with two complete regressions. The median duration of response was 7 months and the median duration of survival 14 months. The cardiac function of all patients was monitored by serial left ventricular ejection fraction, at rest and after stress, and 3-monthly thereafter. Ten patients showed a deterioration in the ejection fraction after a minimum cumulative dose of 86 mg/m2 (six cycles), but only four developed clinical cardiac failure which was easily reversible after stopping mitoxantrone. Leucopenia was the dose-limiting toxicity. Nausea and/or vomiting were generally mild and transient. Alopecia was minimal. These results confirmed that this combination is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of disseminated breast carcinoma, and cardiotoxicity can be avoided with adequate monitoring of the left ventricular ejection fraction after six cycles of therapy (86 mg/m2).",1

4-Demethoxydaunorubicin administered orally in advanced breast cancer. A phase II study.,"Twenty-five patients with advanced breast cancer were treated with 4-demethoxydaunorubicin (4-DMDR), a new antitumor analogue of daunorubicin, at the dose of 15-20 mg/m2/day x 3 days by oral route every 3-4 weeks. All patients were previously treated with chemotherapy and/or hormone therapy but none with anthracyclines. Of 23 evaluable patients, 1 complete and 5 partial remissions (26%) were observed for a median duration of 4+ months. Leukopenia and nausea occurred in 61% of the patients, vomiting in 30%, diarrhea in 17% and alopecia in 43%. There were 2 cases with minimal and transient EKG variations. 4-DMDR, administered orally in advanced breast cancer, was found to be generally well tolerated. Nevertheless, randomized trials with adriamycin or epirubicin are necessary to compare and to define the therapeutic activity and the toxicity of 4-DMDR.",1
"Prednimustine, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, mitoxantrone and tamoxifen for advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women. A phase II trial.","A phase II trial in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer naive to cytotoxic treatment for recurrent disease was performed with a combinated chemo-endocrine regimen of prednimustine, methotrexate, mitoxantrone, 5-fluorouracil, and tamoxifen. Thus we replaced the most toxic agents--cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin often used in combinations--with prednimustine and mitoxantrone respectively, which are supposed to be equally efficient but less toxic. Seventy-seven patients were registered but 6 were ineligible. Complete response was obtained in 11%, partial response in 29%, no change in 29%, and progressive disease in 31%. Median duration of response was 18.5 months, time to disease progression 9.2 months, and survival 16.0 months. Toxicity was modest; 61% had no or only moderate alopecia not necessitating a wig, 59% had no or only moderate, if any, nausea. Bone marrow suppression, especially thrombopenia, was a major dose limiting factor. This regimen seems to be effective and have low toxicity in advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women.",1

Phase II study of divided-dose vinblastine in advanced breast cancer patients.,"The pharmacokinetics of a 5-day, continuous infusion of vinblastine have been reproduced by an i.v. divided bolus at 0 and 48 h [10]; this schedule can be easily applied to outpatients. We treated 26 evaluable patients with refractory, advanced breast cancer with 3.5-4 mg/m2 vinblastine given i.v. by a divided bolus at 0 and 48 h of 21-day cycles. Neurotoxicity and myelosuppression were the main side effects: severe constipation and peripheral neurotoxicity developed in 14% and 3% of the patients, respectively; severe leukopenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 24% and 10% of the patients, respectively. One partial response, 14 no changes, and 11 progressions were obtained. Our results do not support the use of vinblastine in divided doses in treating this disease.",1
A phase II study of oral idarubicin (4-demethoxydaunorubicin) in advanced breast cancer.,"Idarubicin (4-demethoxydaunorubicin: DMDNR) is an orally active analogue of daunorubicin that has shown promising activity in animal and early clinical studies. We gave idarubicin in a phase II study to patients with advanced breast cancer unresponsive to hormonal manipulation and in some cases to standard chemotherapeutic agents. Idarubicin was given orally every 21 days at a starting dose of 40 mg/m2 with dose escalation until myelosuppression occurred. Nadir blood counts showed that patient compliance was good. Of 33 patients studied, 32 are evaluable for response: 4 (13%) had partial responses (95% confidence interval 1%-23%) with a duration of response between 32 and 59 weeks; 8 (25%) had static disease for between 17 and 48 weeks; and 20 failed to respond. For patients not previously exposed to chemotherapy, the response rate was 3/19 (16%). Toxicity was mild, with little or no gastro-intestinal disturbance in the majority of patients, no severe haematological toxicity and little alopecia. Two patients however, were withdrawn from the study because of toxicity; one with a skin rash and one with severe vomiting. Idarubicin produces little toxicity when given orally at a dose of 40 mg/m2 every 21 days, but its activity in breast cancer is insufficient to justify its further use with this schedule. Further studies should be undertaken only if direct comparison can be made with doxorubicin.",1
Phase II trial of fludarabine phosphate (F-Ara-AMP) in patients with advanced breast cancer.,"Eighteen patients with advanced breast cancer were entered into a phase II study of fludarabine phosphate. Fludarabine phosphate was given by continuous infusion for 5 days, at a starting dose of 20 mg/m2 per day for patients previously treated with two or more regimens and 25 mg/m2 per day for minimally treated patients with less than two prior regimens; therapy was repeated every 3-4 weeks. Of the 18 patients, 11 had undergone more than two prior regimens and 7 patients had undergone one prior regimen. One patient achieved a partial response (PR) for 22 months. Myelosuppression was the most common toxicity observed. Four patients developed mild nausea and vomiting and two developed a nonspecific dermatitis that resolved spontaneously. No renal, hepato-, or neurotoxicity was observed. Our study demonstrates that in heavily pretreated patients, fludarabine phosphate given on this schedule has minimal efficacy in treating advanced breast cancer. This drug might possibly have shown more activity in a previously nontreated patient population. However, patients with advanced breast cancer, who have not undergone previous treatment are not often encountered.",1
Treatment of metastatic breast cancer with AZQ: a phase II trial.,Seventeen patients with metastatic breast cancer who had failed prior chemotherapy were treated with intravenous AZQ at a dose of 15-20 mg/m2 weekly for four consecutive weeks followed by a two-week rest period. No responses were observed. Myelosuppression was the dose-limiting toxicity. One patient experienced massive liver infarction possibly related to AZQ. Our data suggest that this agent at the schedule and dosage used is of no benefit in pretreated breast cancer patients.,1
"Combination chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, oral Idarubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FIC) in metastatic breast cancer--an open phase II study.","Phase II studies of p.o. Idarubicin administration, a new daunorubicin analogue (4-demethoxy-daunorubicin), have shown antitumor activity in 23%-31% of previously treated metastatic breast cancer patients, while in untreated patients a response rate of 41% was observed. Our Phase II study has shown an overall response of 23% [1 complete response (CR), 9 partial response (PR), 10/43] with a daily dose of 15 mg/m2 p.o. on days 1,2,3. On the basis of these results we have recently included Idarubicin in combination chemotherapy of breast cancer, substituting Adriamycin by Idarubicin in an FAC schedule. Of 50 consecutive metastatic breast cancer patients who entered the study, 42 patients who received greater than 2 cycles were evaluable. There were 22 premenopausal and 20 postmenopausal patients (mean = 51 years). In 25 patients a performance status of 0-2 (ECOG) was registered and in 17 patients it was 3. Previous radiation had been administered in 34, hormonal therapy in 18, and adjuvant chemotherapy (CMF 5, CMFVP 3) in 8 patients; 22 patients had predominant metastatic sites in soft tissues, 18 in visceral organs, and 2 in the bones. The FIC schedule was administered as follows: 5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 i.v. days 1 and 8, Idarubicin 15 mg/m2 p.o. days 1, 2 and 3, and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 i.v. day 1. An objective response was observed in 23 (5 CR, 18 PR) out of 42 patients (53%, CR 12%). Soft tissue metastases responded in 55% (12/22), visceral organs in 61% (11/18), and no response was observed in bone lesions (0/2). The median remission duration was 8 months (3-16+). Toxicity was mild, expressed mainly in the form of nausea/vomiting, grade I and II in 64% of the patients. Alopecia was very mild (grade I and II in 23% of the patients). Leukopenia grade I-II was observed in 21% of the patients. In 4 patients reversible ECG changes occurred. Left ventricular ejection fraction did not show any pathological changes. The Idarubicin-containing combination chemotherapy we have used has the following characteristics: easier administration (p.o. anthracycline, no risk of tissue extravasation), lower toxicity (cardiotoxicity, alopecia, and myelosuppression in particular), and a notable antitumor activity.",1
Phase II evaluation of Ly156758 in metastatic breast cancer.,Fourteen patients with disseminated breast cancer with primary or secondary resistance to tamoxifen were treated with LY156758. There were no complete or partial responses and 1 patient showed a minor response. These data illustrate that LY156758 did not have significant antitumor activity in patients previously treated with tamoxifen therapy.,1
"Combined antiestrogen and cytotoxic therapy with pseudomonas vaccine immunotherapy for metastatic breast cancer. A prospective, randomized trial.","One hundred thirty-three consecutive, previously untreated patients who had metastatic breast cancer were treated with a combination of 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin (Adriamycin), and cyclophosphamide (FAC). They were randomly assigned to receive nonspecific immunotherapy with a heptavalent pseudomonas vaccine. Sixty-five patients were treated with pseudomonas vaccine, whereas 68 did not receive immunotherapy. In addition, all patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors or tumors with an estrogen receptor status were also treated with tamoxifen. To allow clinical assessment of hormone sensitivity in vivo, tamoxifen was started 6 weeks before chemotherapy except in patients who had life-threatening disease. After the initial 6 weeks of tamoxifen, 3% of patients had achieved a complete remission, 9% a partial remission, while 16% achieved a minor response. The maximum response after tamoxifen and chemotherapy included complete remissions in 20% of patients and partial remissions in 61% of patients for an overall remission rate of 81%. The median response duration was 15 months, and the median survival time, 27 months. There were no differences in remission rate, remission duration, or survival time between the groups treated with or without pseudomonas vaccine. Eleven patients with limited metastatic disease received radiotherapy consolidation to initially involved sites. In these patients the median time from radiotherapy to progression of disease was 33 months, and the median survival time was 46 months. We conclude that nonspecific immunotherapy with pseudomonas vaccine failed to increase remission rate or survival time. Furthermore, the addition of tamoxifen to FAC chemotherapy did not improve the remission rate or duration compared to a recent, historical control group of patients treated with only FAC chemotherapy.",0

Phase II study of iproplatin in metastatic breast carcinoma.,"Thirty patients with progressive metastatic breast cancer and one prior chemotherapy regimen were treated with iproplatin at a starting dose of 300 mg/m2 iv every 3 weeks. After the first 11 patients, the starting dose was decreased to 270 mg/m2. There were one complete remission, three partial remissions, and two minor responses. Responses were observed in soft tissue and osseous and visceral areas. Grade 3 nausea and vomiting were observed in 38% of patients, and grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 31%. The dose-limiting toxicity was thrombocytopenia, which required dose de-escalation in 15 patients. No nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, or ototoxicity was observed.

Twenty-one women entered the study and 19 were evaluable. The mean age was 54.5 years (25-69) with an average performance status of 60 according to Karnofsky. Hormonal receptors were unknown in 10, positive in 6 and negative in 3. The dominant site of disease was soft tissues in 11, bones in 1, liver in 3 and lung in 4. Fourteen patients had as prior treatment cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF), two had tamoxifen and three none. Ten patients (52.6%) had a partial response with a mean survival of 7.8+ months, 5 patients (26.3%) had stable disease with a mean survival 6.6+ months and 4 patients (21.1%) had progressive disease with a mean survival of 3 months. Regarding toxicity all patients had alopecia, most of the patients had nausea grade I, whereas 5 patients developed mild leukopenia. We conclude that VAP is an effective, well tolerated chemotherapy combination in patients with advanced breast cancer which deserves further clinical trials.",1

A phase II study with danazol in metastatic breast cancer.,"Danazol is a synthetic steroid that inhibits the gonadotropin secretion. Its efficacy was tested in 27 patients with metastatic breast cancer at the dose of 200 mg three times daily. Characteristics of patients were as follows. The median age was 57 years (range, 44-85). All patients were postmenopausal, and all had previously received a median of two (range, 1-3) endocrine therapies. Estrogen receptor status was known in 12 (positive in five of 12; negative in seven of 12). Dominant sites of metastases were lung in seven, bone in ten, liver in three, and soft tissue in seven. Six of 27 patients were unevaluable for response (early death, four; lost to follow-up, two). Three of 21 patients showed an objective response, eight of 21 obtained stabilization of disease, and eight progressed. The therapy was well tolerated in the majority: gastric pain was observed in three and nausea in two. Danazol could have a role in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer as an alternative regimen when other treatment has failed.",1

The patients had predominantly visceral disease and received a median of six (range, one to 12) cycles of therapy. There were no complete responders, but 13 patients (52%) achieved partial remission lasting a median of 8 months (range, 4-21+). Three patients (12%) had disease stabilization and nine (36%) had disease progression. Hematologic toxicity was generally mild, with median wbc count and platelet count nadirs of 1900/mm3 (range, 700-3100) and 160,000/mm3 (range, 49,000-406,000), respectively. One patient may have died from treatment-related sepsis (pneumonia), but lymphangitic lung disease was not excluded. Hair loss progressing to severe alopecia over several treatment cycles was relatively common, affecting seven of 16 evaluable patients (44%). Vomiting was mild or absent in 17 (71%) of 24 evaluable patients. Three of 15 patients in whom serial measurements of left ventricular ejection fraction were performed developed significant reductions compatible with anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. Two of these patients also had pericardial effusions and one developed congestive heart failure. In conclusion, mitoxantrone and doxorubicin is an active, well-tolerated drug combination for the treatment of advanced breast cancer but may have appreciable cardiotoxicity.",1

Long duration of response with vindesine-mitoxantrone-mitomycin (VMMc) combination chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer: a pilot phase II study.,"A total of 39 women with metastatic breast cancer entered a pilot phase II study of the vindesine-mitoxantrone-mitomycin (VMMc) combination chemotherapy. Most of them had received previous chemotherapy [including doxorubicin (27 patients)] for their primary or metastatic disease. The VMMc drugs were given at usual doses. Hematologic side effects were the most serious, leading mainly to leukopenia (five episodes of infection were successfully treated). A 33% partial response rate was obtained (95% confidence limits, 18%-48%), with a median duration (not yet reached) of greater than 510 days (range, 150-720) for the overall population. The median for pretreated patients was greater than 420 days (range, 150-720) which compares favorably with those previously reported in similar patients treated by mitomycin and vindesine or vinblastine.",1

Phase II study of idarubicin given orally in the treatment of anthracycline-naive advanced breast cancer patients.,"A phase II study of 4-demethoxydaunorubicin (idarubicin) administered orally (45 mg/m2) every 3 weeks was conducted in patients with anthracycline-naive advanced breast cancer. Fifty patients were eligible to enter the trial; the median time to disease progression for all 50 patients entered was 22 weeks. Four patients achieved complete response and 14 achieved partial response. Response rate was 36% (complete response + partial response) for all patients entered. The median duration of tumor regression was 39 weeks. The treatment toxic effects observed were both hematologic and nonhematologic and of moderate degrees. Hair loss was observed in 86% of the patients, nausea and vomiting in 96%, and diarrhea in 36%. Cardiac function was monitored with isotope angiocardiography and no patients developed clinical congestive heart failure, up to a median cumulative dose of 260 mg/m2. The left ventricular ejection fraction decreased with a median value of 4% in seven patients treated with greater than 360 mg/m2. This study indicates that idarubicin administered orally has pharmacodynamic effects comparable to those of doxorubicin administered iv on an every-3-week schedule.",1
Clinical trial of plasma perfusion over immobilized staphylococcal protein A in metastatic breast cancer.,"Nineteen patients with metastatic breast cancer refractory to conventional therapy were treated with plasma perfusion over 200 mg of staphylococcal Protein A immobilized on a silica matrix. Fever and chills (33%), pain at the site of tumor (18%), and dyspnea (16%) were the most frequent toxic effects encountered. Four patients (21%) developed a disseminated rash which necessitated cessation of treatment. Of 16 patients evaluable for response, one achieved a minor response of chest wall disease and two had no change in hepatic metastases for 4 and 5 months' duration. Potential mechanisms of antitumor effect are discussed.",0
A phase II study of oral weekly 4-demethoxydaunorubicin in advanced breast cancer.,"Thirty-eight patients with advanced breast cancer were treated with oral 4-demethoxydaunorubicin in a continuous weekly schedule at a dose of 15 mg/m2/week. Subjective toxicity consisted of mild nausea (grade 1) in 52% with more severe GI side effects (grade 2) in 15%. Three patients developed grade 1 alopecia and there were no episodes of cardiac failure. Significant neutropenia (grade 2/3) only occurred in patients with marrow involvement or widespread bone disease. There was one CR and 5 PRs, an overall response rate of 15.7% (95% confidence limits 6-31%). In addition 6 patients had disease stabilization for at least 6 months. Fourteen patients progressing on 4-demethoxydaunorubicin have received adriamycin 60 mg/m2 21 days. There have been 5 PRs in this group indicating possible non-cross-resistance between these two agents.",1
A phase I-II study of intensive-dose adriamycin for advanced breast cancer.,"Twenty-six women with metastatic breast cancer were treated with intensive Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) as a single agent administered for three successive days once a month. Dosing started at 25 or 30 mg/m2/d three times, and was escalated by 5 mg/m2/d monthly to maximal tolerance based on hematologic, mucosal, or cardiac toxicities. Four patients (15%) had complete remissions (CRs) pathologically proven, and six others (23%) sustained complete CRs, but were found to have microscopic residual tumor (three) or refused biopsy (three). Twelve patients (46%) attained partial remission (PR). The overall response (85%) and CR rates (38%) were approximately double those reported with conventional Adriamycin doses. Median unmaintained remission duration for the ten patients in CR was 11 months. Cardiotoxicity, determined by radionuclide physiologic studies, occurred in 16 patients at a mean dose of 459 mg/m2; three patients developed reversible congestive failure. There were no toxic deaths. The median overall survival was 18 months. These data suggest that there is steep dose responsiveness to Adriamycin in metastatic breast cancer, and that more effective techniques for using Adriamycin may exist than those conventionally used.",1
The antiprogestin RU486 in advanced breast cancer: preliminary clinical trial.,"Twenty-two oophorectomized or postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer resistant to several medical therapies (tamoxifen, or other endocrine therapy, and chemotherapy) were treated in a first trial with 200 mg per day of RU486 for 1 to 3 months. The long-term tolerance was good but there was a moderate decrease in plasma potassium. Plasma cortisol was increased 2-fold without clinical hypo- or hypercorticism. Twelve patients had a partial response or a stabilization of secondary deposits for 6 weeks but the response rate at 3 months was 18%. When available, estrogen and progesterone receptor levels were positive in these patients. This preliminary trial shows for the first time that the antiprogestin RU486 is well tolerated for medium term treatment. It suggests that it might be active on advanced breast cancer becoming resistant to tamoxifen.",1

Preliminary results of a phase II trial for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer with 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin.,"The active metabolite of FUra, 5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (5-FdUMP), requires the presence of reduced folates to form a covalent ternary complex with the target enzyme thymidylate synthase (TS). In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated a potentiation of the cytotoxic effects of FUra when combined with the reduced folate, leucovorin. We have applied this concept to the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in a phase II trial, as recent clinical studies on patients with colorectal carcinoma have suggested an enhanced efficacy for the combination of FUra plus leucovorin. Patients entered on the present study are undergoing treatment with a 5-day daily regimen of leucovorin (500 mg/m2, iv) followed by FUra (375 mg/m2, iv). Toxicity and response data are currently being collected on patients who have failed ""standard"" combination regimens that included FUra. In patients with accessible tumor, serial biopsies are being obtained during treatment with the combination of FUra and leucovorin and during therapy with FUra alone to assess the degree of 5-FdUMP binding to the target enzyme, TS, in the presence and absence of exogenously administered leucovorin. Preliminary results from the biochemical studies suggest an enhanced saturation of TS by the fluorinated pyrimidine when administered with leucovorin.",1
Phase II study of oral 4-demethoxydaunorubicin in previously treated (except anthracyclines) metastatic breast cancer patients.,"Forty-eight patients with metastatic breast cancer previously treated with cytostatics (except anthracyclines) underwent peroral treatment with 4-demethoxydaunorubicin (4-DMDR), a new daunorubicin analogue. Forty-three patients received greater than or equal to 2 cycles and have been evaluated. The mean age was 54 years, with 10 premenopausal and 33 postmenopausal patients. All the patients showed progressive disease. Performance status 0-2 (ECOG score) was recorded in 34, and 3 in 7 patients. Soft tissue metastases were recorded in 23, visceral in 10 and bone in 10 patients. 4-DMDR was administered in the dose of 15 mg/m2 perorally daily, on day 1, 2 and 3 (45 mg/m2 per cycle). Since there was no severe toxicity, after 2 cycles the dosage was increased to 60 mg/m2 per cycle. The patients received 2-6 cycles (median 3) and the total cumulative dose ranged from 90 to 300 mg/m2 (median 140 mg/m2). Objective response was observed in 10 patients (1 complete remission, 9 partial remissions) with a response rate of 23% (10/43). Soft tissue metastases were most responsive (8/23-35%). Two responses were observed in visceral organs. Response lasted 2-6+ months (median 4 months). Toxic side effects have been mild with myelotoxicity (grade I-II) observed in 23% of patients. Alopecia (grade 1-15 patients, grade II and III = 4 patients) was moderate. Nausea and vomiting (grade I-II) was present in 60% of patients. In all the patients MUGA scans (left ventricular ejection fraction) were in normal range, however, reversible ECG changes have been recorded in 4 patients (grade I = 3, grade II = 1). All the changes appeared on the 3rd day of the cycle but became normal before starting a new cycle. In conclusion, it should be emphasized that 4-DMDR administered perorally (45 mg/m2 per cycle) in previously treated (except anthracycline) metastatic breast cancer patients showed antitumor efficacy with a low incidence of toxic side effects. Further clinical studies, possibly with the dose escalation in the schedule we have used, will be needed in previously untreated breast cancer patients to determine exact antitumor activity of this new daunorubicin analogue.",1
Idarubicin in advanced breast cancer: a phase II study.,Twenty-nine patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated orally with idarubicin (15 mg/m2 X 3 days every 3-4 weeks). Objective response was seen in 31% of all patients. Toxicity was acceptable. There should be further clinical trials of new anthracycline antibiotic.,1
Aminoglutethimide and medroxyprogesterone acetate in the treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer. A phase II study of the Association of Medical Oncology of the German Cancer Society (AIO).,"One hundred twenty-eight women with advanced metastatic breast cancer were treated with a combination of aminoglutethimide (AG) (1000 mg orally, daily) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) (1500 mg orally, daily for six weeks and thereafter 500 mg orally, daily; omitting cortisone substitution). AG/MPA did not lead to side effects other than those described under AG or MPA monotherapy. Mental and personality changes seem to be more severe and frequent under combined therapy than under monotherapy. Impairment of mental functions, depressive syndromes, fatigue, ataxia, skin rash, and transient increase of gammaglutamyl transferase appeared and disappeared within the first 4 to 6 weeks of treatment. Objective remissions of at least 3 months duration from initiation of therapy were seen in 21 of 128 patients (21.9%) (3.9% complete remission [CR], 18% partial remission [PR]). A no change (NC) status occurred in an additional 25.8%. The remission duration (mean and range) was 19 (10.5-54) for CR, 16.5 (4.5-52+) for PR and 6 (3-27) months for NC patients. The highest response rate was registered for patients with only bone involvement (PR, 11; and NC, 11 of 26 patients). There was a distinct correlation of response to prior systemic treatment, receptor status of the primary tumor, disease-free interval, menopausal status, age and condition of the patient. PR was obtained in 4 of 20 patients with receptor-negative primary tumors. These results justify a prospective trial comparing AG/MPA with other forms of endocrine therapy in selected patient subgroups.",1
Phase II study of lonidamine in patients with metastatic breast cancer: a National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group Study.,"The National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group conducted a phase II study of lonidamine, given in an escalating oral daily schedule to a maximum dose of 450 mg/m2 in patients with previously treated advanced breast cancer. Five responses were seen in 30 evaluable patients (17%). Treatment was discontinued because of toxicity in seven patients. Toxicity generally consisted of myalgia, nausea, vomiting, skin hyperesthesia, somnolence, and ototoxicity. All side effects were reversible and no hematologic toxicity was observed. The absence of myelosuppression and the suggestive lack of cross-resistance between lonidamine and standard chemotherapeutic drugs warrant further studies of lonidamine in breast cancer, particularly in combination with other agents.",1

"Treatment of advanced postmenopausal breast cancer with an aromatase inhibitor, 4-hydroxyandrostenedione: phase II report.","4-Hydroxyandrostenedione (4-OHA), a potent new aromatase inhibitor, was given i.m. (500-1000 mg) to 58 patients with advanced postmenopausal breast cancer. Of 52 assessable patients 14 responded (27%), in 10 (19%) the disease stabilized, and in 28 (54%) the disease progressed. Sterile abscesses occurred at the injection site in 6 patients and painful lumps were found in a further 3 patients. Two patients developed allergic-type reactions and 4 developed lethargy, suspected to be treatment induced. Plasma estradiol levels were suppressed from a mean of 7.2 +/- 0.8 (SE) pg/ml before treatment to 2.6 +/- 0.2, 2.7 +/- 0.2, and 2.8 +/- 0.3 pg/ml after 1, 2, and greater than 4 months, respectively, of treatment and remained suppressed in patients whose disease relapsed. No significant fall in estrone levels was seen. Similarly, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, sex hormone binding globulin, and gonadotrophin levels were unaltered after 6 months of treatment. Plasma 4-OHA levels were measured in a radioimmunoassay for androstenedione after chromatographic separation of 4-OHA from androstenedione. Drug concentrations ranged from 0.7 to 23.2 (7.8 +/- 1.1) ng/ml after 2 months on treatment. 4-OHA is an effective drug in the management of postmenopausal patients with breast cancer and does not produce notable systemic side effects.",1
Phase II evaluation of megestrol acetate in previously treated patients with advanced breast cancer: relationship of response to previous treatment.,"Thirty-seven patients with advanced breast cancer were treated with megestrol acetate 160 mg daily. All patients except two had been heavily pre-treated with hormonal therapy; eight patients also received chemotherapy. Complete and partial responses occurred in 25% with a mean duration of 5 months (range 2-24 months). A further 38% of patients had static disease for 2 months or greater. Seven patients had previously received medroxyprogesterone acetate, and responses were seen even in patients who had failed to respond to this therapy. This was thought to be due to the higher levels of progestogenic activity which can be routinely achieved with megestrol acetate. Toxicity was minimal, and we would therefore consider that megestrol acetate should be the progestogen of choice in advanced breast cancer.",1

High-dose mitoxantrone in metastatic breast cancer: a phase I-II trial.,"Eighteen women with metastatic breast cancer entered a phase I-II study of high-dose mitoxantrone (MXT). They were heavily pretreated (mean, 2.3 prior regimens) with drugs including both doxorubicin (14 patients) and MXT at usual doses (three). Doses studied were 16, 20, 25, and 30 mg/m2, repeated every 3-4 weeks. Marked leukopenia was seen at all dose levels (four episodes of infection were successfully treated). Fatigue and malaise were the most common nonhematologic toxic effects. At 25 mg/m2, six of 13 courses resulted in severe fatigue and malaise. MXT is tolerated at doses up to 25 mg/m2 every 3-4 weeks. Cardiac function must be closely monitored. No responses were seen in these heavily pretreated patients.",1
Platinum and etoposide in chemotherapy refractory metastatic breast cancer. A phase II trial of the Italian Oncology Group for Clinical Research (G.O.I.R.C.).,"Twenty-four evaluable extensively pretreated advanced breast cancer patients received a combination of platinum and etoposide. Platinum was given i.v. at the dose of 80 mg/mq at day 1. Etoposide was given at the dose of 120 mg/mq i.v. at day 1, and p.o. at the dose of 200 mg/mq at day 3 and 5. Treatment was repeated every 3 weeks. CR was never obtained. PR was observed in four patients (17%), MR in two, NC in seven and PD in 11 patients. PR plus MR occurred in six patients (25%). Considering the extensive pretreatment of patients, the results seem to indicate that this combination is active and can be included among the possible options in treating chemotherapy refractory advanced breast cancer. Moreover, it deserves further evaluation in an earlier phase of the disease.",1
A phase II study of mitoxantrone in advanced breast cancer.,"A phase II study with mitoxantrone has been carried out in 30 metastatic breast cancer patients. Of 26 evaluable patients 7 (26.9%) experienced a partial response; 7 (26.9%) patients had stable disease and 12 (46.1%) had progression. Major toxicity observed was: nausea and vomiting in 52% of patients, moderate hair loss in 53% of patients and leukopenia in 53%.",1

"Phase II studies of homoharringtonine in patients with advanced malignant melanoma; sarcoma; and head and neck, breast, and colorectal carcinomas.","Five phase II trials of the antitumor agent homoharringtonine were conducted in 80 patients who had advanced solid tumors. The five categories of solid tumors included malignant melanoma; sarcoma; and head and neck, breast, and colorectal carcinomas. The starting dose of homoharringtonine was 3.0-4.0 mg/m2 by short iv infusion daily X 5 days every 21 days. Seventy-eight of 80 patients had had prior chemotherapy and 49 had had prior radiation therapy. Among the 74 evaluable patients in the five tumor categories, there were no complete or partial remissions. Homoharringtonine was generally well-tolerated. Nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, and fever and chills were the most common side effects. Serious reversible cardiovascular toxicity, which occurred in three patients, included symptomatic hypotension in two and short runs of ventricular tachycardia in one. The investigations thus conclude that homoharringtonine given by intermittent schedule is an inactive drug against these solid tumors previously exposed to chemotherapy.",1
"Combined cytotoxic and endocrine treatment of postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer: preliminary results of a phase II study of the combination of prednimustine, novantrone, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, and tamoxifen.","Postmenopausal patients with advanced measurable and/or evaluable breast cancer entered a phase II trial of multiple agent cytotoxic therapy combined with endocrine therapy. Cycles of PNMF (prednimustine, novantrone, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil) were repeated every 4 weeks as follows: P, 100 mg/m2 PO on days 1 to 5; M, 40 mg/m2 IV on day 1; F, 600 mg/m2 IV on day 1, and N, 14 mg/m2 IV on day 8. The endocrine therapy was tamoxifen given continuously, 10 mg three times daily. As of May 1985, 32 eligible patients had entered the study, 20 of whom had been treated for a sufficient time to enable evaluation of response. Ten patients responded (one complete, nine partial), five experienced no change, and five patients experienced progressive disease. The treatment regimen was fairly well tolerated, the dose-limiting factor being the hematologic toxicity. Conclusions from the trial must await the inclusion of more patients and longer time of follow-up.",1
"A preliminary analysis of combination therapy with vincristine, adriamycin, and prednimustine (VAP) in advanced breast cancer: a phase II study.","Between March 1984 and May 1985, 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer and high-risk prognostic factors were treated with vincristine, 1.4 mg/m2 IV on day 1, Adriamycin, 40 mg/m2 IV on day 1, and prednimustine, 100 mg/m2 PO on days 3 to 7. Courses were repeated every 3 weeks. At the present time, 26 patients are evaluable for tumor response; 29 are evaluable for toxicity. Fourteen of 26 patients (53.8%) achieved a partial response lasting 2 to 9 months (median 5.5+). A complete response was not recorded. Ten of 26 patients (38.5%) had stable disease; two patients (7.7%) showed a primary tumor progression. Most common side effects were nausea, vomiting, and alopecia, all generally mild to moderate. Fourteen of 29 patients developed leukocytopenia, mainly of WHO grade 1; thrombocytopenia was registered in one patient only and a fall of hemoglobin in three patients only. In 15 patients, no hematologic toxicity occurred. These preliminary data suggest good antitumor activity and acceptable toxicity for vincristine-Adriamycin-prednimustine in patients with metastatic breast cancer.",1
Randomized trial of bilateral oophorectomy versus tamoxifen in premenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer.,"A randomized clinical trial was performed to compare the efficacy of bilateral oophorectomy with that of tamoxifen at a dose of 10 mg twice daily in premenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer, and to examine the efficacy of each as a crossover treatment. Initial treatment responses were seen in ten of 27 patients (37%) treated with oophorectomy and seven of 26 patients (27%) treated with tamoxifen. The difference was not statistically significant. Crossover responses were seen in five of 15 patients (33%) treated with oophorectomy, including three responses in ten prior tamoxifen nonresponders; and two of 18 patients (11%) treated with tamoxifen. Time to progression distributions were not significantly different during initial treatment, and no significant differences in survival were noted. Thus, there was no overall disadvantage to the use of tamoxifen as opposed to oophorectomy as initial hormonal therapy, and a failure to respond to tamoxifen did not preclude a response to subsequent oophorectomy. Exploratory data analysis within subsets indicated consistent differential treatment effects in the visceral dominant patients. Of the 16 such patients treated with oophorectomy, eight (50%) experienced objective responses but there were no responses in the 14 patients treated with tamoxifen. In the nine visceral dominant crossover patients who had not responded to initial tamoxifen, three (33%) subsequently responded to oophorectomy. Time to progression distributions within the visceral dominant subset appeared to be better for the patients treated initially with oophorectomy. However, one must be very cautious in drawing conclusions from exploratory subset analyses, especially with the small sample size. Further studies would be required to test any hypothesis of differential organ site responsiveness.",0
A phase I/II investigation of trioxifene mesylate in advanced breast cancer. Clinical and endocrinologic effects.,"Tamoxifen and trioxifene are antiestrogens that appear to have different endocrine effects when tested in rats. Whereas tamoxifen has considerable clinical activity, trioxifene is a new antiestrogen with undefined clinical activity. Thirty-six patients were treated with graded doses of trioxifene. The low-dose group (0.5 to 12 mg/m2 twice daily) had a 21% response rate in 24 subjects, and the high-dose group (40 to 100 mg/m2 twice daily) had a 33% response rate in 12 patients (P = 0.13). The time to treatment failure was 67 days and 178 days for the low- and high-dose groups, respectively. Toxicities were non-dose dependent; those of moderate frequency included leukopenia (41%) and nausea (31%). Tamoxifen reduced both prolactin and inducible growth hormone (GH). Trioxifene, although reducing prolactin, differed from tamoxifen in that an increase in inducible GH occurred. Furthermore, a striking dose-dependent decrease in luteinizing hormone and lesser decrease in follicle-stimulating hormone occurred only in the trioxifene-treated patients. This implies an intrinsic estrogenic action of trioxifene in man. Trioxifene is no more efficacious than tamoxifen and has more toxicity.",1
Phase II trial with oral idarubicin in advanced breast cancer.,"Idarubicin, a new analogue of daunorubicin, was administered to 27 patients with advanced breast cancer in a phase II trial. The drug was given orally at a dose of 30-35 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. Twenty-two patients were evaluable for response. All evaluable patients were previously treated with one or more chemotherapeutic regimens, including an anthracycline in more than 50% of the cases. Partial remissions were obtained in 5 patients, for a response rate of 23%. The median duration of response was 191 days. Mild nausea and vomiting were common. Diarrhea, which occurred in less than 50% of the patients, was usually short-lived. Alopecia was generally minimal. Myelosuppression was the dose-limiting toxic effect. Leukopenia was frequently seen, with full recovery by day 28 in 81% of the courses. Thrombocytopenia was less common than leukopenia. Four cases of grade 1 acute cardiac toxicity were recorded. This study suggests that idarubicin can induce regressions in advanced carcinoma of the breast, and justifies further studies in combination with other agents.",1
Recombinant gamma interferon in advanced breast cancer: a phase II trial.,"Fifteen patients with advanced carcinoma of the breast who had failed prior chemotherapy, were treated with recombinant gamma interferon at a dose of 2mg/m2 (1mg = 2.4 X 10(7) international units) intravenously for five consecutive days every other week. The median patient age was 51 and all patients had a performance status of 0-2 (Karnofsky greater than or equal to 50). Thirteen patients had two or three sites of metastatic disease and seven were estrogen receptor positive. No complete or partial responses were noted. Although some patients had brief periods of stable disease, almost all patients progressed after one or two courses. Only one patient was able to receive six courses of induction therapy and a brief course of maintenance. Flu-like symptoms and nausea were seen in all patients; vomiting and anorexia were frequent. Hepatic toxicity manifested by enzyme elevation was common and was most severe in patients with liver metastases. In this study a highly purified biologically active gamma interferon was not associated with anti-tumor activity in previously treated women with metastatic breast cancer.",0
Phase II study of AMSA and doxorubicin to treat metastatic breast cancer.,"Twenty-two evaluable patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with a combination of 4-(acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide (AMSA) and doxorubicin. All patients but one had received prior therapy with fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide, and methotrexate. Eight patients had partial responses (36%) with a median time to treatment failure of 6 months. Two patients (9%) showed minor responses, and their times to progression were 4 and 6 months. The response rates obtained with this drug combination were similar to those observed in earlier studies using doxorubicin alone.",1
Aminoglutethimide and estrogenic stimulation before chemotherapy for treatment of advanced breast cancer. Preliminary results of a phase II study conducted by the E.O.R.T.C. Breast Cancer Cooperative Group.,"While both endocrine therapy and chemotherapy are of proven value in the treatment of advanced breast cancer, the effects of combining these two methods or applying them consecutively have been relatively disappointing. This may be due to endocrine therapy suppressing cell division, in hormone-dependent tumors, whereas chemotherapy acts mainly on active-dividing cells. A trial protocol has therefore been devised which seeks to exploit the properties of both types of therapy. Oestrogen suppression is first obtained by aminoglutethimide (Orimeten) plus hydrocortisone; after 2 weeks, ethinyloestradiol is given to induce cell division and followed 24 h later by a combination of 3 cytotoxic agents given intravenously. This pattern of therapy, repeated at regular intervals, appears to be producing favorable clinical results. A phase-III study is being started among patients with hormone-dependent advanced breast cancer.",1
Phase II trial of 4'-deoxydoxorubicin in patients with advanced breast cancer.,"4'Deoxydoxorubicin (25 mg/m2 iv every 3 weeks) was evaluated in 20 patients with advanced breast cancer. The patients had good performance status and had not been heavily pretreated. Although all patients experienced leukopenia, no major therapeutic responses were observed. Nonhematologic toxicity was mild. Further evaluation of 4'-deoxydoxorubicin at this dose and schedule is not warranted in patients with advanced breast cancer.",1
A phase II study of bisantrene in advanced refractory breast cancer. An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group pilot study.,"Thirty patients with advanced refractory breast cancer received bisantrene 260 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks. Reversible myelosuppression was the most commonly observed side effect. Four patients (13.3%) achieved objective partial response (90% confidence intervals 3-24%), while two patients (6.6%) had disease improvement with a PR + IMP rate of 19.9%. Seven additional patients (23.3%) had stabilization of disease. This drug has antitumor activity against breast cancer and warrants further study, particularly if problems with drug delivery are overcome.",1

Mild to moderate nausea and mouth dryness were the most frequently encountered side effects. Hemolysis occurred in five patients who had an IgM antibody and represents the dose-limiting toxicity. Cumulative renal toxicity (World Health Organization, grade 2) was observed in one of ten patients who had received greater than 2000 mg of elliptinium.",1
Phase II trial of alpha-lymphoblastoid interferon given weekly as treatment of advanced breast cancer.,"Eighteen patients with advanced breast cancer refractory to first-line chemotherapy and hormonal therapy (or estrogen receptor-negative) were treated with human alpha-lymphoblastoid interferon (Wellferon) in a dose of 30 X 10(6) U/m2 im weekly. None of 15 patients receiving three or more doses achieved a partial or complete response. Toxicity was substantial and included fatigue, malaise, fever, hematologic suppression, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea.",1
Cisplatin plus vindesine in advanced breast cancer: a phase II trial of the EORTC Breast Cancer Cooperative Group.,"This phase II clinical trial was conducted in a series of patients with advanced breast cancer, refractory to conventional chemotherapy. The therapeutic regimen consisted of a combination of cisplatin 100 mg/m2, given as a 24-hr infusion on day 1 and vindesine (VDS) 2 mg/m2, i.v. bolus on days 1 and 8. VDS injection was omitted on day 8 in patients with poor bone marrow reserves (prior extensive irradiation). Courses were repeated at 4-week intervals until documented disease progression. Among 46 evaluable patients, there were two complete and seven partial remissions for an overall response rate of 20%. These responses lasted for a median of 21 weeks (range 8-89 weeks). Remission rates according to the predominant metastatic site were as follows: soft tissue, 3/8 (38%); bone, 0/6 (0%); viscera, 6/32 (19%). Transient myelosuppression and gastrointestinal intolerance were almost universal. Renal function impairment and neurologic manifestations were frequently encountered but these adverse reactions were generally mild. Significant antineoplastic activity in far-advanced and heavily pretreated patients warrants further evaluation of this regimen at an earlier stage of the disease.",1
Randomized trial of estrogen vs. tamoxifen therapy for advanced breast cancer.,"Forty-three postmenopausal females with advanced breast cancer were studied in a prospective comparative trial of estrogen vs. an anti-estrogen (tamoxifen) therapy with a crossover to the alternative hormone with progressive disease. Ten of 19 patients (53%) responded to primary tamoxifen therapy and six of 24 (25%) responded to primary estrogen therapy. Crossover responses were observed in seven of 19 (37%) on the secondary tamoxifen therapy and in two of 10 (20%) on secondary estrogen therapy, and were not related to the response to the primary hormonal maneuver. Responses were related to the presence of estrogen receptor protein (ERP), particularly for tamoxifen therapy, although responses were observed in three of six ERP negative patients receiving estrogen and in seven of 25 (28%) of patients with an unknown ERP status. Complications were observed in 35 instances with estrogen therapy and in only five instances with tamoxifen therapy. Initial hormonal therapy with tamoxifen in postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer and ERP status positive or unknown is superior to primary estrogen treatment. Secondary therapy and response to estrogen or tamoxifen is not necessarily predicted by the initial hormone response, and crossover to the alternative therapy is generally indicated.",1
A clinical trial of aminoglutethimide in advanced postmenopausal breast carcinoma: low response in patients previously treated with medroxyprogesterone.,"In an attempt to define the influence of prior hormonal treatments upon aminoglutethimide activity in advanced cancer of the breast, 42 heavily pretreated postmenopausal patients received aminoglutethimide, 4 X 250 mg daily, with hydrocortisone or cortisone. Twenty-six received high doses of medroxyprogesterone before entering this study. There was no significant difference in patients' characteristics with or without medroxyprogesterone pretreatment. A comparison of patients with and without prior medroxyprogesterone shows a significant difference in the response rate to aminoglutethimide-hydrocortisone (4 vs 32%, P = 0.02). In patients pretreated with tamoxifen but not with medroxyprogesterone the response rate to aminoglutethimide was 36%. These results suggest that aminoglutethimide has a low activity in breast cancer patients previously exposed to medroxyprogesterone, an agent with glucocorticoid-like activity inducing adrenal suppression.",1

Recombinant DNA human interferon alpha 2 in advanced breast cancer: a phase 2 trial.,"Effectiveness of recombinant DNA (rDNA) human interferon alpha 2 (IFN alpha 2) in advanced breast cancer was evaluated in 14 patients who had received prior endocrine and/or cytotoxic therapy. After randomization, 7 patients received IFN alpha 2 two million IU m-2 day-1, s.c., 3 times a week (schedule 1) and 7 patients received 50 million IU m-2 day-1, i.v., for 5 consecutive days, every 3 weeks (schedule 2). Treatment duration was 4-21 weeks in schedule 1 and 6-24 weeks (2-8 courses) in schedule 2. Regressions were not achieved with either schedule. Treatment was associated with significant toxicity and was more severe in schedule 2. Dose limiting toxicities were leukopenia, elevation of liver enzymes, hyperglycemia and fatigue. Serum IFN activity was low or undetectable in patients on schedule 1 and high in patients on schedule 2. At 24 h, serum IFN activity was detectable in only 1/6 patients on schedule 1 as compared to 3/7 patients on schedule 2. IFN neutralizing factors were detected in the serum of only 1 patient prior to treatment but none were detected in any of the patients during or after discontinuation of treatment (4-24 weeks). IFN alpha 2 increased the expression of both HLA class 1 antigens and beta 2 microglobulin in peripheral blood lymphocytes in vivo. This effect was dose related.",1
"Phase II study of vincristine, mitomycin-C and mitoxantrone in advanced breast cancer: a preliminary report of response and toxicity.","Nineteen patients with advanced, previously treated breast cancer received treatment with vincristine 2 mg i.v., mitomycin-C 6 mg/m2 and mitoxantrone (Novantrone; dihydroxyanthracenedione) 12 mg/m2 i.v. every three weeks. Thirteen patients are evaluable for response and toxicity. Partial remission was seen in six patients, with soft tissue, bone and visceral metastases and static disease in a further four patients. Median duration of response has not yet been reached (8+ months). Toxicity was mild and predictable, with no patient experiencing severe nausea and vomiting, and only four of the patients requiring a wig for alopecia. Malaise and lethargy were common in those patients receiving more than three courses, and an increase in the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) together with a fall in haemoglobin were seen in patients receiving multiple courses of treatment. The study suggests that this combination is active, and may prove useful with other agents in the treatment of breast cancer.",1
Phase II study of mitolactol in chemotherapy-refractory metastatic breast cancer.,"Thirty-eight evaluable patients with metastatic breast cancer refractory to hormonal therapy and multiple chemotherapy regimens were treated with mitolactol at a dose of 130 mg/m2/day orally for 10 days every 6 weeks. Only one patient, with nodal and chest wall metastases, had a sustained complete regression; two patients had stable disease; and 35 patients had disease progression. The toxicity, which was primarily hematologic, was acceptable.",1

A phase II study of recombinant alpha interferon in patients with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer.,"Thirty-three patients with advanced breast cancer were treated with a recombinant alpha interferon (rIFN-alpha 2). All patients were ambulatory (performance status greater than or equal to 50 Karnofsky scale) and almost all had received previous chemotherapy. Large intravenous dosages of 30 to 50 X 10(6) IU/m2 were given for five consecutive days every two to three weeks to 22 patients and smaller subcutaneous dosage of 2 X 10(6) IU/m2 three times a week to 11 patients. No complete or partial responses were seen. Two patients had stable disease and the remainder progressed. Flu-like syndromes were seen in all patients. Nausea, vomiting, and anorexia were frequent. Hypotension and confusion were noted in six and five patients, respectively. Life-threatening leukopenia was noted in two patients receiving intravenous dosage and thrombocytopenia was noted in one; no sepsis or bleeding complications were noted. In this study, a highly purified and biologically active rIFN-alpha 2 was not associated with activity in previously treated women with metastatic breast cancer.",1
Clinical trial of combined hormone therapy (MAP + TAM) for metastatic breast cancer.,High dose MAP (medroxyprogesterone acetate) and TAM (tamoxifen) were administered orally to 31 postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer. CR (complete remission) was achieved in 1 (3%) and PR (partial remission) in 11 (32%) patients for a median duration of 12 months. The treatment was well tolerated and in no instance was interrupted because of toxicity. This study does not support the hypothesis that the combination of MAP and TAM gives better results than the single agents.,1
Sequential methotrexate plus 5-FU in advanced breast and colorectal cancers: a phase II study.,"Fifty-two patients with advanced breast or colorectal cancer have been treated with methotrexate (MTX) (50 mg/m2) followed 6 hours later by 5-FU (600 mg/m2). The mean serum MTX level immediately prior to 5-FU administration was 1.37 mumols/L (1.37 X 10(-6) M). Of 29 evaluable patients with breast cancer (six of whom had received prior chemotherapy), one achieved a complete response and five achieved a partial response (total response rate, 21%). Among 16 evaluable patients with colorectal cancer (three of whom had received prior chemotherapy), there were no objective responses. Although hematologic toxicity was generally mild, mucositis occurred in 20 patients (severe in three), and at least one early death was attributable to toxicity. These results indicate that at doses of MTX and 5-FU which are in general use in combination chemotherapy for breast cancer, sequential treatment does not have a therapeutic advantage. In colorectal cancer, the same combination is inactive.",1
A comparative trial of transsphenoidal hypophysectomy and estrogen suppression with aminoglutethimide in advanced breast cancer.,"We compared two treatment regimens, transsphenoidal hypophysectomy and estrogen suppression with aminoglutethimide in women with metastatic breast carcinoma. Three of fourteen patients experienced partial objective tumor regression with a median duration of 4.6 months following hypophysectomy, whereas 10 of 21 women receiving aminoglutethimide responded (2 complete, 8 partial) with a median duration of 11.5 months. Side effects in the medical group were minimal while surgical complications included 2 cases of CSF rhinorrhea, one leading to meningitis and death. In patients receiving aminoglutethimide, urinary free cortisol and plasma dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate fell significantly as did plasma estrone and estradiol. In the hypophysectomy group, anterior-pituitary function testing postoperatively revealed adequate suppression of gonadotropin and prolactin secretion but incomplete inhibition of the ACTH-cortisol axis in 4 of 7 surgical patients studied. Five patients initially treated with hypophysectomy experienced a further reduction of plasma (and urinary) estrone and estradiol levels when given aminoglutethimide. We conclude that estrogen suppression therapy with aminoglutethimide is a feasible alternative to surgical hypophysectomy in providing endocrine suppression and palliation in advanced breast carcinoma.",0
