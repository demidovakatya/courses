Part 1 covers vector and matrix math, and you'll do a few exercises by hand.  In Part 2, you'll learn about NumPy and use `ndarray` objects to solve the math exercises.   Part 3 provides additional information about NumPy and how it relates to array usage in Spark's [MLlib](https://spark.apache.org/mllib/).  Part 4 provides an overview of lambda expressions.\n\nTo move through the notebook just run each of the cells.  You can run a cell by pressing \"shift-enter\", which will compute the current cell and advance to the next cell, or by clicking in a cell and pressing \"control-enter\", which will compute the current cell and remain in that cell.  You should move through the notebook from top to bottom and run all of the cells.  If you skip some cells, later cells might not work as expected.\nNote that there are several exercises within this notebook.  You will need to provide solutions for cells that start with: `# TODO: Replace <FILL IN> with appropriate code`.\n\n** This notebook covers: **\n* *Part 1:* Math review\n* *Part 2:* NumPy\n* *Part 3:* Additional NumPy and Spark linear algebra\n* *Part 4:* Python lambda expressions\n* *Appendix A:* Submitting your exercises to the Autograder"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["labVersion = 'cs120x-lab1a-1.0.0'"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Part 1: Math review"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### (1a) Scalar multiplication: vectors\n\nIn this exercise, you will calculate the product of a scalar and a vector by hand and enter the result in the code cell below.

Just pass a two-dimensional `ndarray` or a list of lists to the function.  You can perform matrix math on NumPy matrices using `*`.\n\nYou can transpose a matrix by calling [numpy.matrix.transpose()](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.matrix.transpose.html) or by using `.T` on the matrix object (e.g. `myMatrix.T`).  Transposing a matrix produces a matrix where the new rows are the columns from the old matrix.

These slices operate the same way as slices for Python lists.  For example, `[0, 1, 2, 3][:2]` returns the first two elements `[0, 1]`.  NumPy, additionally, has more sophisticated slicing that allows slicing across multiple dimensions; however, you'll only need to use basic slices in future labs for this course.\n\nNote that if no index is placed to the left of a `:`, it is equivalent to starting at 0, and hence `[0, 1, 2, 3][:2]` and `[0, 1, 2, 3][0:2]` yield the same result.  Similarly, if no index is placed to the right of a `:`, it is equivalent to slicing to the end of the object.

PySpark provides a [DenseVector](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.mllib.html#pyspark.mllib.linalg.DenseVector) class (in module the module [pyspark.mllib.linalg](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.mllib.html#module-pyspark.mllib.linalg)), which allows you to more efficiently operate and store these sparse vectors.\n\n`DenseVector` is used to store arrays of values for use in PySpark.  `DenseVector` actually stores values in a NumPy array and delegates calculations to that object.  You can create a new `DenseVector` using `DenseVector()` and passing in a NumPy array or a Python list.\n\n`DenseVector` implements several functions.  The only function needed for this course is `DenseVector.dot()`, which operates just like `np.ndarray.dot()`.\nNote that `DenseVector` stores all values as `np.float64`, so even if you pass in an NumPy array of integers, the resulting `DenseVector` will contain floating-point numbers. Also, `DenseVector` objects exist locally and are not inherently distributed.  `DenseVector` objects can be used in the distributed setting by either passing functions that contain them to resilient distributed dataset (RDD) transformations or by distributing them directly as RDDs.  You'll learn more about RDDs in the spark tutorial.\n\nFor this exercise, create a `DenseVector` consisting of the values `[3.0, 4.0, 5.0]` and compute the dot product of this vector with `numpyVector`."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from pyspark.mllib.linalg import DenseVector"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":36},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# TODO: Replace <FILL IN> with appropriate code\nnumpyVector = np.array([-3, -4, 5])\nprint '\\nnumpyVector:\\n{0}'.format(numpyVector)\n\n# Create a DenseVector consisting of the values [3.0, 4.0, 5.0]\nmyDenseVector = DenseVector([3.0, 4.0, 5.0])\n# Calculate the dot product between the two vectors.\ndenseDotProduct = np.dot(numpyVector, myDenseVector)\n\nprint 'myDenseVector:\\n{0}'.format(myDenseVector)\nprint '\\ndenseDotProduct:\\n{0}'.format(denseDotProduct)"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":37},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# TEST PySpark's DenseVector (3c)\nTest.assertTrue(isinstance(myDenseVector, DenseVector), 'myDenseVector is not a DenseVector')\nTest.assertTrue(np.allclose(myDenseVector, np.array([3., 4., 5.])),\n                'incorrect value for myDenseVector')\nTest.assertTrue(np.allclose(denseDotProduct, 0.0), 'incorrect value for denseDotProduct')"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":38},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Part 4: Python lambda expressions"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### (4a) Lambda is an anonymous function\n\nWe can use a lambda expression to create a function.  To do this, you type `lambda` followed by the names of the function's parameters separated by commas, followed by a `:`, and then the expression statement that the function will evaluate.  For example, `lambda x, y: x + y` is an anonymous function that computes the sum of its two inputs.\n\nLambda expressions return a function when evaluated.  The function is not bound to any variable, which is why lambdas are associated with anonymous functions.  However, it is possible to assign the function to a variable.  Lambda expressions are particularly useful when you need to pass a simple function into another function.  In that case, the lambda expression generates a function that is bound to the parameter being passed into the function.\n\nBelow, we'll see an example of how we can bind the function returned by a lambda expression to a variable named `addSLambda`.  From this example, we can see that `lambda` provides a shortcut for creating a simple function.  Note that the behavior of the function created using `def` and the function created using `lambda` is equivalent.  Both functions have the same type and return the same results.  The only differences are the names and the way they were created.\nFor this exercise, first run the two cells below to compare a function created using `def` with a corresponding anonymous function.  Next, write your own lambda expression that creates a function that multiplies its input (a single parameter) by 10.\n\nHere are some additional references that explain lambdas: [Lambda Functions](http://www.secnetix.de/olli/Python/lambda_functions.hawk), [Lambda Tutorial](https://pythonconquerstheuniverse.wordpress.com/2011/08/29/lambda_tutorial/), and [Python Functions](http://www.bogotobogo.com/python/python_functions_lambda.php)."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Example function\ndef addS(x):\n    return x + 's'\nprint type(addS)\nprint addS\nprint addS('cat')"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":41},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# As a lambda\naddSLambda = lambda x: x + 's'\nprint type(addSLambda)\nprint addSLambda\nprint addSLambda('cat')"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":42},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# TODO: Replace <FILL IN> with appropriate code\n# Recall that: \"lambda x, y: x + y\" creates a function that adds together two numbers\nmultiplyByTen = lambda x: x * 10\nprint multiplyByTen(5)\n\n# Note that the function still shows its name as <lambda>\nprint '\\n', multiplyByTen"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":43},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# TEST Python lambda expressions (4a)\nTest.assertEquals(multiplyByTen(10), 100, 'incorrect definition for multiplyByTen')"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":44},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### (4b) `lambda` fewer steps than `def`\n\n`lambda` generates a function and returns it, while `def` generates a function and assigns it to a name.  The function returned by `lambda` also automatically returns the value of its expression statement, which reduces the amount of code that needs to be written.\n\nFor this exercise, recreate the `def` behavior using `lambda`.  Note that since a lambda expression returns a function, it can be used anywhere an object is expected.

The syntax for `lambda` allows for multiple ways to define the same function.  For example, we might want to create a function that takes in a single parameter, where the parameter is a tuple consisting of two values, and the function adds the two values together.  The syntax could be either: `lambda x: x[0] + x[1]` or `lambda (x0, x1): x0 + x1`.  If we called either function on the tuple `(3, 4)` it would return `7`.  Note that the second `lambda` relies on the tuple `(3, 4)` being unpacked automatically, which means that `x0` is assigned the value `3` and `x1` is assigned the value `4`.\n\nAs an other example, consider the following parameter lambda expressions: `lambda x, y: (x[0] + y[0], x[1] + y[1])` and `lambda (x0, x1), (y0, y1): (x0 + y0, x1 + y1)`.  The result of applying either of these functions to tuples  `(1, 2)` and `(3, 4)` would be the tuple `(4, 6)`.\n\nFor this exercise: you'll create one-parameter functions `swap1` and `swap2` that swap the order of a tuple; a one-parameter function `swapOrder` that takes in a tuple with three values and changes the order to: second element, third element, first element; and finally, a three-parameter function `sumThree` that takes in three tuples, each with two values, and returns a tuple containing two values: the sum of the first element of each tuple and the sum of second element of each tuple."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Examples.

This is because they were created to demonstrate the differences and similarities between `lambda` and `def`.  An excellent use case for lambda expressions is functional programming.  In functional programming, you will often pass functions to other functions as parameters, and `lambda` can be used to reduce the amount of code necessary and to make the code more readable.\nSome commonly used functions in functional programming are map, filter, and reduce.  Map transforms a series of elements by applying a function individually to each element in the series.  It then returns the series of transformed elements.  Filter also applies a function individually to each element in a series; however, with filter, this function evaluates to `True` or `False` and only elements that evaluate to `True` are retained.  Finally, reduce operates on pairs of elements in a series.  It applies a function that takes in two values and returns a single value.  Using this function, reduce is able to, iteratively, \"reduce\" a series to a single value.\n\nFor this exercise, you'll create three simple `lambda` functions, one each for use in map, filter, and reduce.  The map `lambda` will multiply its input by 5, the filter `lambda` will evaluate to `True` for even numbers, and the reduce `lambda` will add two numbers.\n\n> Note:\n> * We have created a class called `FunctionalWrapper` so that the syntax for this exercise matches the syntax you'll see in PySpark.\n> * Map requires a one parameter function that returns a new value, filter requires a one parameter function that returns `True` or `False`, and reduce requires a two parameter function that combines the two parameters and returns a new value."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Create a class to give our examples the same syntax as PySpark\nclass FunctionalWrapper(object):\n    def __init__(self, data):\n        self.data = data\n    def map(self, function):\n        \"\"\"Call `map` on the items in `data` using the provided `function`\"\"\"\n        return FunctionalWrapper(map(function, self.data))\n    def reduce(self, function):\n        \"\"\"Call `reduce` on the items in `data` using the provided `function`\"\"\"\n        return reduce(function, self.data)\n    def filter(self, function):\n        \"\"\"Call `filter` on the items in `data` using the provided `function`\"\"\"\n        return FunctionalWrapper(filter(function, self.data))\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        return (isinstance(other, self.__class__)\n            and self.__dict__ == other.__dict__)\n    def __getattr__(self, name):  return getattr(self.data, name)\n    def __getitem__(self, k):  return self.data.__getitem__(k)\n    def __repr__(self):  return 'FunctionalWrapper({0})'.format(repr(self.data))\n    def __str__(self):  return 'FunctionalWrapper({0})'.format(str(self.data))"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":56},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Map example\n\n# Create some data\nmapData = FunctionalWrapper(range(5))\n\n# Define a function to be applied to each element\nf = lambda x: x + 3\n\n# Imperative programming: loop through and create a new object by applying f\nmapResult = FunctionalWrapper([])  # Initialize the result\nfor element in mapData:\n    mapResult.append(f(element))  # Apply f and save the new value\nprint 'Result from for loop: {0}'.format(mapResult)\n\n# Functional programming: use map rather than a for loop\nprint 'Result from map call: {0}'.format(mapData.map(f))\n\n# Note that the results are the same but that the map function abstracts away the implementation\n# and requires less code"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":57},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# TODO: Replace <FILL IN> with appropriate code\ndataset = FunctionalWrapper(range(10))\n\n# Multiply each element by 5\nmapResult = dataset.map(lambda x: x * 5)\n# Keep the even elements\n# Note that \"x % 2\" evaluates to the remainder of x divided by 2\nfilterResult = dataset.filter(lambda x: (x % 2) == 0)\n# Sum the elements\nreduceResult = dataset.reduce(lambda x, y: x + y)\n\nprint 'mapResult: {0}'.format(mapResult)\nprint '\\nfilterResult: {0}'.format(filterResult)\nprint '\\nreduceResult: {0}'.format(reduceResult)"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":58},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# TEST Functional programming (4e)\nTest.assertEquals(mapResult, FunctionalWrapper([0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45]),\n                  'incorrect value for mapResult')\nTest.assertEquals(filterResult, FunctionalWrapper([0, 2, 4, 6, 8]),\n                  'incorrect value for filterResult')\nTest.assertEquals(reduceResult, 45, 'incorrect value for reduceResult')"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":59},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### (4f) Composability\n\nSince our methods for map and filter in the `FunctionalWrapper` class return `FunctionalWrapper` objects, we can compose (or chain) together our function calls.
