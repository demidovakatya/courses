We can view the top 15 words by using the `takeOrdered()` action; however, since the elements of the RDD are pairs, we need a custom sort function that sorts using the value part of the pair.\n\nYou'll notice that many of the words are common English words. These are called stopwords. In a later lab, we will see how to eliminate them from the results.\nUse the `wordCount()` function and `takeOrdered()` to obtain the fifteen most common words and their counts."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# TODO: Replace <FILL IN> with appropriate code\ntop15WordsAndCounts = wordCount(shakeWordsRDD).takeOrdered(15, key = lambda x: -x[1])\nprint '\\n'.join(map(lambda (w, c): '{0}: {1}'.format(w, c), top15WordsAndCounts))"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":64},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# TEST Count the words (4f)\nTest.assertEquals(top15WordsAndCounts,\n                  [(u'the', 27361), (u'and', 26028), (u'i', 20681), (u'to', 19150), (u'of', 17463),\n                   (u'a', 14593), (u'you', 13615), (u'my', 12481), (u'in', 10956), (u'that', 10890),\n                   (u'is', 9134), (u'not', 8497), (u'with', 7771), (u'me', 7769), (u'it', 7678)],\n                  'incorrect value for top15WordsAndCounts')"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":65},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Appendix A: Submitting Your Exercises to the Autograder\n\nThis section guides you through Step 2 of the grading process (\"Submit to Autograder\").\n\nOnce you confirm that your lab notebook is passing all tests, you can submit it first to the course autograder and then second to the edX website to receive a grade.\n\n** Note that you can only submit to the course autograder once every 1 minute. **"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Step 2(a): Restart your cluster by clicking on the dropdown next to your cluster name and selecting \"Restart Cluster\".\n\nYou can do this step in either notebook, since there is one cluster for your notebooks.\n\n<img src=\"http://spark-mooc.github.io/web-assets/images/submit_restart.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" />"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Step 2(b): _IN THIS NOTEBOOK_, click on \"Run All\" to run all of the cells.\n\n<img src=\"http://spark-mooc.github.io/web-assets/images/submit_runall.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"height: 80px\"/>\n\nThis step will take some time.\n\nWait for your cluster to finish running the cells in your lab notebook before proceeding."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Step 2(c): Publish this notebook\n\nPublish _this_ notebook by clicking on the \"Publish\" button at the top.\n\n<img src=\"http://spark-mooc.github.io/web-assets/images/Lab0_Publish0.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"height: 150px\"/>\n\nWhen you click on the button, you will see the following popup.\n\n<img src=\"http://spark-mooc.github.io/web-assets/images/Lab0_Publish1.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" />\n\nWhen you click on \"Publish\", you will see a popup with your notebook's public link. **Copy the link and set the `notebook_URL` variable in the AUTOGRADER notebook (not this notebook).**\n\n<img src=\"http://spark-mooc.github.io/web-assets/images/Lab0_Publish2.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" />"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Step 2(d): Set the notebook URL and Lab ID in the Autograder notebook, and run it\n\nGo to the Autograder notebook and paste the link you just copied into it, so that it is assigned to the `notebook_url` variable.\n\n```\nnotebook_url = \"...\" # put your URL here\n```\n\nThen, find the line that looks like this:\n\n```\nlab = <FILL IN>\n```\nand change `<FILL IN>` to \"CS120x-lab1b\":\n\n```\nlab = \"CS120x-lab1b\"\n```\n\nThen, run the Autograder notebook to submit your lab."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### <img src=\"http://spark-mooc.github.io/web-assets/images/oops.png\" style=\"height: 200px\"/> If things go wrong\n\nIt's possible that your notebook looks fine to you, but fails in the autograder.
